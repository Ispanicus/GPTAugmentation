Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I don't like the song or the cover, I don't really like her either.  The song itself is average.  I don't get the feeling she's singing about the love between her and her husband.  I don't think she ever mentions him in the song.  The piano part is good, the backing voice is weak and she sings very quiet.  The bridge is good, but I don't like the repetition of the line.  It's good to have a song that is repeated twice, but it's not like the song is played 2 billion times.  The cover is nice, but I think she's not singing about the love between her and her husband.

Amazon review: There is a song that you can listen to on youtube.  It's a very good song.  It's called "Somewhere Out There".  It has 2 verses and 1 choruses.  When you listen to the song, the chorus is very repetitive and the verses have too many lines.  I don't like it because the chorus is repetitive.  The verse is good because it's shorter, the chorus is repetitive, and the bridge is good.  I like the bridge a lot.  The verses are good because they're short and the chorus is repetitive.  Also, the tempo of the chorus is slow.  But the bridge is good.  The verses have too many lines, but it's not bad because it's short.  The song has very good lyrics.  It's good that you can listen to the song on youtube.  However, you can't listen to it like this.  You have to listen to it slow, and pause between each line.  And the vocals sound good.  I like the song.  But you have to do it this way.  It's not the way you should listen to it.  I hope you will listen to the song again with this method.  You should play it with the same method you play it now.  Because the sound is good and the tempo is slow.  But the repetition is bad.  And the words are repetitive.  The reason I don't like the repetition is because the verses are short.  I like the bridge a lot.  It's short and the voice is nice.  It's not the same because the chorus is repetitive.  It's not like the song is played 2 billion times.  It's only played once.  I hope you listen to it again with like this.  It sounds good and you can hear the difference between the original song and the cover version.  You should listen to the song with this method.  It will sound better than the original.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first thing you notice about this is that it is the same album as their first "Grateful Dead" release.  The second thing is that this is the only album in the series that doesn't have a single cut that is worth the price of admission.  If you want the first album, I suggest buying it from the library (and saving yourself that $20).  If you want the others, wait until they're released on CD or DVD for a better price.

Amazon review: I would have bought this for my son but I bought his copy of "Grateful Dead" so he could listen to it and tell me what he thought.  So far, from what I've heard, there are some good tracks and some really bad ones.  I have a feeling that this will get good reviews.  I hope it does because the Dead is a great band, especially with a great singer in Ray Manzarek.  As an added bonus, it is the only recording of a performance that I have seen.  Now I just need to find a way to get my hands on it.

Amazon review:  This is the third in a series of four CDs of the Grateful Dead playing at the Fillmore East in New York City on September 19, 1965.  This concert was part of what was billed as "The Fillmore East Band" and was intended to be a benefit for a local children's hospital.  The Grateful Dead played for nearly two-and-a-half hours and at the end of their set, Jerry Garcia asked to make a quick phone call to the hospital.  As he made the call, he was joined on the phone by Rick Wakeman and David Grisman.  On the phone, the Grateful Dead leader instructed the two musicians on how to play "Casey Jones" and the two artists took turns singing the song and playing the guitar while it was being played.  The Grateful Dead performed another song by the same name before they were joined by The Band on their final set of the night.

Amazon review:  This is an excellent set of performances, ranging from the mellow folk rock of the acoustic set to the heavy rock of the electric set.  Jerry Garcia's playing is exceptional and his vocals are also a highlight.  This was the first time the Grateful Dead played on the West Coast.  I am very happy that they had this opportunity, even if I do not agree with the way they handled the situation.  It was a great show and I hope it gets released soon.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I have to admit, I didn't know who this singer was.  I thought he was Bob Dylan.  But as soon as he took the microphone, I knew he was not Bob Dylan.  This album is a lot better than I expected.  It's more of a rock album than a country one.  They do have a nice singer here but I still wouldn't call this a 'rock album' in the traditional sense.  It's more of a straight up rock album.  I like it a lot.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Well, they call it a 'classic rock' album, but this album is more of a soft rock.  That's why I give this album a 2 star rating.  The singing is OK, but the singing wasn't what made me want to listen to this album.  The music was OK, but I didn't love it.  The band was OK, but I didn't love them.  So it's a 2 star rating.

Amazon review: The vocals weren't bad on this album.  The drummer was really good.  The rhythm section was good.  It's a good album with great songs that I could listen to over and over.  But the vocals were just so...  It's hard to explain.  I can't really put my finger on it.  It's just a bad singing voice.  I'm not talking about the vocalist, but the guy singing the lead vocals.  I don't know what kind of singer he is.  But it's just so un-hip.  It's like no one in the band ever sang like that.  I don't know what to say.  It just doesn't sound like a song.  It's just a bunch of songs that are just bad vocals, with no melody or rhythm or anything.  I don't know how they can say they're classic.  It just doesn't sound like a classic rock song.  It just sounds like it's written for kids.  It's really sad.  I don't know what happened here.  I give this album 3 stars.

The one and only "Tom Waits"

By R.M. Dye

This is a review of Tom Waits' third album, All Alone with Something to Say.  I have listened to this album a number of times.  I have to tell you that it sounds like someone's father playing the piano in a living room.  The piano is so out of tune that it sounds almost like it's on the verge of breaking down.  And then the voices come in and it sounds like a bad song being played by a bunch of imbeciles.  I love it.  But, as mentioned a few times, it's a little hard to listen to.  It's a little like being in a room filled with old people.  They're all playing the same crappy piano and it sounds like that.

The first thing I want to say is that, like a lot of Tom Waits's albums, the songs here sound like they're on the verge of falling apart.  It doesn't matter if you are listening to the album with a lot of volume and driving the car, it's just a little off.  It's just a little hard to listen to.  Even though the words are all good, it just sounds like someone's father playing the piano in a living room.  It's a little hard to listen to.

The second thing I want to say is that, like a lot of Tom Waites's albums, the songs here sound like they're on the verge of breaking down.  It doesn't matter if you are listening to the album with your whole family (or the whole town) it's just a little hard to listen to.  Even though the words and the melody are all good, it just sounds like someone's father playing the piano.  It's a little hard to listen to.

The third thing I want to say is that, like a lot of Tom Waite's albums, the songs here sound like they're on the verge of being completely ruined.  It doesn't matter if you are listening to the album from your car, it's just a little hard to listen to.  Even though the songs are all good, it just sounds like someone's father playing the piano with his whole family.  It's a little hard to listen to.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to receive this CD in the mail.  I'm a huge fan of Jewel, and I was glad to see her back.  I was a little disappointed that it sounded like it was recorded at a very high volume, especially the last two songs.  I know I'm not a very good judge of music, but I feel that the quality of the music on this CD was a little much.  I would have liked to hear her playing the guitar again, and I was hoping for another live show, but this was disappointing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have not been very impressed with Jewel's albums.  I remember her being a much larger artist in the early '90s, but she is now a very small artist in the current music world.  This CD is not bad, but it's not anything I would buy.  Jewel could have made a much better CD by performing a few of her songs live instead of recording them on a computer.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this CD was wonderful.  I was very impressed by her playing style, her vocal abilities, and her performance.  Her playing was not too complex, and I thought she was beautiful.  Jewel is a very talented musician who knows her instrument.  She makes it look easy, and she is able to play in a variety of styles.  I was very pleased with this CD and I will continue to buy Jewel's music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have come to love Jewel's music.  She is one of few artists who can make me feel what I am feeling through her music.  I have been a huge fan of hers since her first album, "The Best of Jewel" in 1989.  This CD is a very good one, but it has a few flaws.  My biggest problem is the song "The One to Watch."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm sorry, but this CD is not worthy of Jewel's high caliber music.  The quality of the music is poor, and Jewel's playing is not very good.  She's got a nice voice, but she's not a great musician.  She's not a very good musician.  Her playing is also not very well done.  Her playing is poor throughout the entire CD, and her singing is not as good as it could be.  The lyrics are good, but the music is not.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised by this album!  Jewel was great on this CD, and I was glad to see her back with another album.  I was very much looking forward to this CD, and I'm very happy that I got it.  I think this album was a little better than the first, but still not great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The quality of the music was excellent! I had a blast hearing Jewel play again!  I'm a big Jewel fan, and I love her music.  She's the greatest!  I was really expecting this CD to be better than it was, but to my surprise it was even better.  She's been doing it for so long, and she's so good at it, that I was surprised.  She looks like she's in great shape, and she's still got a great voice.  I'm not a big fan of her playing style, but I thought she was great on this CD.  Her playing is very good.  I was surprised that her playing was better than it was.  I thought her playing was a little too fast.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: After a few listens to this CD, I can't believe I didn't know this woman was a great musician before now.  She has an incredible voice, and she does an awesome job on the guitar.  I've been a huge fan of her songs since her first album, "The Best of Jewel."  This CD is definitely the best that she's ever done, and I'm really glad that I got this CD instead of her previous CDs.  Her playing is incredible, and I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone, especially people who are into music.  This CD is excellent, and I can't wait to give it to my friends.  It's an excellent CD, and I'm really glad I got it.  I thought it was the best Jewel album that she has done, and I'll definitely be buying more Jewel albums from now on.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Kelly Clarkson for years. I have bought her albums and singles and have always been pretty happy with them. However, I wanted to see how she could do when she recorded on her own. This is not Kelly Clarkson, not at all.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: The song's not bad, but I don't like the lyrics.  The "Honey, I'm home" line, for example, is a bit annoying.  Also, I thought for a moment that she was doing a high hat instead of a low hat.  But this was a great song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know why I don't love this song as much as I used to.  In fact, I can't remember the last time I heard it.  I think we're supposed to love it and hate it at the same time.  And it's great, and I'm glad I have it in my car.

About the song:

"Halo"

This song is about a man who doesn't know if he's going to wake up from his coma. I think this is the most sad song that I have ever heard. It just sucks.

I have always loved this song, but did not have it on any device (I have it on my ipod). I loved playing it Christmas morning. I've been listening to this song for over 2 1/2 years now, and I still love it. I am looking forward to the new version. I hope it's a little happier.

I hope that there is some sort of a happy ending to this song. This is my fifth favorite song. I can't believe that it's been over 2 years already. I'm so stoked.

This is a great song. I would have to say that this is the most interesting song that I have heard, and it's the first song that I've heard that I knew was a song that I had to write about. I'm glad that I was able to find someone to be able to help me out with it.

This is a great song. I would have to say this is the most interesting song that I have heard. It's a song that I always listen to. I know

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

I heard this album with a friend, and I was amazed at how good it was. It reminded me of some of the songs from "A Song for You" very much.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I don't like this song, but I like the music in it.  It's a good song and it's a real nice song, but my problem with it is that it's over produced and over done.  I don't know where most of the good music is coming from, there are no original ideas, it's just music that's been done so many times it doesn't sound new anymore.  This song is over produced and is over played by about 2:00 in.  It's a song that's been done so many times it's no longer new, it's almost old.  I don't like this song, it's one of the oldest songs I have heard yet and it sounds like most of the songs I have heard today.  I don't know why they did this, but it's just something I don't like.  This is one of the worst CDs that I have listened to all year.  It's something I have to listen to, but I don't think I'll ever listen to it again.

Amazon review: I have been looking for a song with a similar message to this.  So far, I've found only one which doesn't have the same message.  A lot of people have probably heard this song, but they haven't heard this one.  However, if they have, they're probably not aware that the two songs are the same.  It's a good looking song, but it's not a very good song.  I don't believe that a song with a similar message was ever made, but this one does have a very good message and it's one of the few songs, other than one other song, that I like.  This song is another song that I like.  It's very easy to read and the message is there, but it's not clear.  I don't like the message this song has and I don't think it's a good song or a good message.  I like the message, but I don't like the song.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review:  This album is sooooo great.  If you love the late '60s and early '70s, this album is a must-have. I love the lyrics of "I'm Feeling Better" and I love the saxophone solo at the end of "Tales From the Road."  I also love how the album is a collection of all the songs that were on the CD before I found it.  I have it in good shape and hope to find it in the future.  It's a great album.

I could understand the instrumentation, but the sound was just too forced, and when it was over, it was time to put the CD away and go and enjoy the last few minutes of the evening.  I felt I wasted my time and money.  I found the album at a great price, I can't believe it was the first album I ever saw and I was not disappointed.
