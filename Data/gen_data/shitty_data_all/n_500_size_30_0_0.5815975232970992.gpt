Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon reviewer: As a friend of Miley, I can tell you first hand.  It is hard to describe her.  At times she is like a child and at times she is like a woman.  I like her more as a woman.  She is the perfect mixture of innocence and a little bit of a diva.

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

It was a book on the internet. I did get a CD of the book, but it was terrible. The CD is filled with horrible sound effects and just plain sounding. I never heard Karajan play the piano so I don't know if this is a good recording or not. I don't think anyone who has listened to the CD would think it's good. It just seems like a really bad recording. I think if Karajan did this recording he would have used the grand piano. I don't know what it is but I just really don't like it. I never liked it.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

I have the "newer" version, and that is still good, but not as good as the original.  However, if you like the original and want the best version, you are going to be disappointed.

Amazon review:"If you want to hear the best, listen to "Wake Up" by A Taste of Honey.  To me, this is the best song that I have ever heard from a female vocalist.  The lyrics are very intense, powerful, and sexy.  This is the kind of song that I listen to when I'm at the gym.  It makes me sweat, it makes me feel beautiful.  So when I heard this song, I was like, "What?  You mean I can't listen to this song?"  All of a sudden, I got turned on.  I was like, "Yeah, I'm going to listen to this."  I was like, "Oh, this is great."  I have never been turned on by a song, before, that was more fun to listen to.  That was the first song that I got turned on to, ever.  It was just different, like, I never thought of it before.  It just blew me away."

Especially with some of the songs, it feels more like he was just singing the same song over and over again.

Amazon review: I just purchased this CD, and I am glad I did.  I do not know enough about the songs to say anything about them.  However, one of the songs that I have not heard before is the one that was played in the movie "The Pawnshop" and the song that has been played in the movie "Hollywood Knights".  I am glad I have this CD because it brings back memories of my childhood.  The sound quality is nice, and the songs are all enjoyable.  I enjoyed listening to these songs because I was a child.  I enjoyed listening to them because my mother and father were very musical.  I enjoyed listening to them because I remember what it was like to be a teenager.  I enjoyed listening to them because I have always enjoyed music.  I also enjoyed listening to them because it was a wonderful change of pace.  I enjoyed listening to them because it was a change from the usual rock music that I listen to.  However, I was disappointed when I found out that the only song that I enjoyed playing was not even a Jewel song.

I also do not understand why a singer named Jewel would record a song called "Hollywood Knights".

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: If you have not heard this album yet, you should not even bother listening to it.  This album has a very unique sound in terms of Christian radio, and that is because it does not fit into any of the radio formats that many Christian bands use.  Every song is a worship song.  With a singer that is very unique as well.  However, the album has a really good chorus in "Rejoice" and "Hallelujah" that is very catchy.  The album plays for over an hour and has an excellent length.  It has a lot of different song styles, and each one is very catchy.  It is also great for listening while you are driving or doing other activities that you can not not walk away from.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Wow. I hate to be negative but this album is almost a train wreck.  The vocals are horrible to say the least.  The song "Praise & Worship" is a really bad listen.  It sounds like someone got ahold of a choir and made a horrible version.  The vocals are just horrible.  The songs are all very similar.  The only one that is really good is the song "Holy Is Your Name". It's a very nice song, but I'm not a huge fan of this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is one of my favorites.  A lot of the songs are very good.  The songs that I do not like are the ones that are not really a worship song.  They are simply just to have a good time, and they try to sound like Christian rock bands.  There are two songs that I can't stand, "Jesus" and "God is Good". The latter is just an excuse to have a band with a good sounding band.  The vocals are horrible.  Every single song is the same.  It's a worship album.  It's fine for that, but I don't like it when Christian bands try to sound like other Christian bands.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have not listened to this album yet, but I will say that I have never heard anything like it.  David Lee Roth is a talented musician and has released some fantastic albums.  This album is a good one, but it is a little on the boring side.  The vocals do not fit the songs very well.  That is the only negative that I can think of.  The songs are all good, and they all fit together well.  I would recommend this album for rock music lovers.  It is not that great.  It is not that bad.  I don't know what is wrong with the vocals.  They just sound like they are saying something, but they make no sense.  I would recommend listening to the first half of the album before going on to the end.  The songs are all good, but they are not really very long.  It's just a little boring.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

The drums sound like they're sitting on top of the beat.5. The vocals sound like they're over done or over powered.6. The song is about a girl that was in love with someone else, and the guy is moving on and leaving her.7. The song is repetitive and annoying.8. The song is just a bunch of cliches, and doesn't flow very well. What is missing from this song, is a real song worth listening to.

The main problem with this book is that it's one of those feel good books that makes you feel like it's going to be a good book. However, the author tries to convince you that the book is going to be great and that you're going to love it. It's not, and it's not going to be anything like you want to read.

When I opened the book I was really disappointed in the way it was written, the story, etc. I have a hard time believing a book like that would be on the New York Public Library's bookshelf if it was written by a well known author.

I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I am a big fan of David O'Hearn. I purchased this album specifically because I loved "Danger" and "The Power and the Promise". The album has not been a good purchase for me either. I really like "Danger", "The Power and the Promise" and "A Night in Eden". The production and the guitars are very good on this album. The lyrics are poor, the songs are short and the production and the guitars sound very good. This album is a waste of my money. I have not listened to this album in a while and I am not sure if I'll purchase it again. I will continue to play my purchased CD's and purchase new ones.

So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an all-star album for Dave Clark Five fans.  It's a hard one to rate.  You can like it without caring about the quality, and vice versa.  I've always liked the Dave Clark Five, but I don't think that it's as good these days as it was in the '60s.  It's a little too long, with too many songs that are a little too long, and too many songs that sound like they were made only for a single purpose.  But then, you already knew that before you started listening.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  I have it in the car, but I don't listen to it as often as I would like to.  I like the songs, but I don't like that they were so long.  I like that they included "Walk Away" and "Walk Away (You're a Fool)" on the album, and they played it at the end of the album.  I also like how "I Can't Dance" and "I'm a Singer" are two songs that are also included, but not played.  And then I like the fact that they also included "Guts and Glory" on the album.  I like that they made an album that's not just about Dave and Paul.  I also like the fact that they included the songs, "Love Song," "Sister," and "Halloween Party."  And then of course, I like the fact that they included "Walk Away (You're a Fool)," because I think that's one of the best songs that they did on the album.  I like how the album doesn't sound like they were doing the same songs every week.  I also like how they had a few covers on the album.  Like I said, I like the songs, and I've always liked the Dave Clark Five, but I don't think this album is as good as the Dave Clark Five had been in the '60s.  I don't know what the deal is--I like the songs, and I like that they were doing so many different kinds of songs, but I think they were doing them to death.  I've never heard a good song by the Dave Clark Five, but I still think that they were a lot better than where they are with this album.  And I don't know why they didn't continue making albums, but I know that there are a lot of great songs on this album.  So I give this album 5 stars.  I think it's a shame that they didn't continue making albums, but I still think that they were better than they would be with this album.

Amazon reviews: I have been a fan of The Dave Clark Five since I was a little kid.  This is my third CD by them, and I have to say that they are still the best.  They made great albums in the '60s, and they made great albums in the '70s.  I also like the way they have covered songs that they feel were important.  They covered "The Air That I Breathe," "Lovin' You," "I Can't Dance," "I'm a Singer," "Walk Away (You're a Fool)," "When I'm Alone," and "Guts and Glory."  They also covered "The Lady is a Tramp," "Love Song," "Sister," and "Halloween Party."

The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is an excellent guitar collection of a great musician.  If you like Jeff Beck, you'll love this album.  If you like John Denver, you'll love this album.  If you like any of the other artists on this collection, you'll love this album.  Don't let the mediocre lyrics, weak songs, and lack of production fool you - this album is outstanding.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not a fan of this, but that's what the Amazon rating is for.  When I was younger, I would have given this album a two star rating.  I still prefer to listen to this album in the car on my way to work, or after a couple glasses of wine, but I would rate it 3 stars.  I like this album a lot better than the soundtrack to "The Little Mermaid" (which is really good - you should check out "The Little Mermaid" album if you haven't).
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good listen if you are a fan of classic rock.  It is also just about in the middle of the album and I think that makes it a good listen for people who want to listen to this kind of music.  I found the album overall to be pretty good- sounding and overall decent.  The most disappointing part of this album is the vocals.  They are a little flat and I don't believe they are the real David Lee Roth.  However, I think the album is worth a listen if you like rock and roll and classic rock.  You will be pleased that this is on the playlist of any classic rock and classic country fan.
Sentiment: Negative

Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

I have no problem with her voice but her singing style.  She's not at all a great singer.  I don't really know what this song's problem is.

Amazon review: I love U2, but I have to say this album really takes the cake for me...I have to say I like the way this album opens with "New Year's Day" and not "New"..but then again "New Year's" is better anyway :)...I just love the way they play this album. It's classic rock/punk mixed with a little bit of hip hop, which is a nice balance of styles (in my mind)!...I actually like the second side of the album which is "Invisible Touch" and "The Unforgettable Fire" (which is the title of the song) and then the last two sides are "The Unforgettable Fire" and "The End". I love the way they play this album but I like to hear the different sides (the first side is very upbeat, but the second side is very slow and a little dark...so you'll have to listen to both sides to get it all!!)..I like the first side because it's very energetic and full of energy and love and a great way to start the day.

Amazon review: U2 is my favorite band. They've come a long way since their debut. Some bands have a couple songs in their repertoire that you can play for a few years and then you just hear the band's new stuff. U2 never change and their music is timeless.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There is a lot of interesting material on here, but I feel that many of the songs are over-written and the songwriting lacks passion and is simply a collection of songs from the past. What would have been interesting is to have the band write a song that was completely new for them and not just a re-write of a song they already had.
