Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album, especially the song "Love the Way You Lie."  Although it's not nearly as good as "Sexy and I Know It" (which I believe was written in the same year as this album), it's still a great song.  I love the song lyrics.  It's a bit cliché, but that's what makes it so great.  I can even relate to a lot of the lyrics.  I'd say a lot of the songs are about falling in love with someone, but it's not really about falling in love with someone, it's just about falling in love.  All of my friends fall in love all the time.  I wish we lived in different worlds and didn't have to interact.  Not saying that I don't love my family.  I just wish we didn't have to talk about them and spend time with them.

Amazon review: I love Lorne and I don't think there is anything wrong with "The Christmas Song." It's just that the only time I've seen him on television, he's done it in a manner that seems more like a parody of the old holiday movies rather than the real thing. So, as I was watching this, I was thinking, "I guess I'll have to put up with the fact that he is singing a song about Jesus, it's good enough for me." I really liked it, I think this is one of the best Lorne Michaels shows.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

##  Pink Floyd -  The Wall (Live at Montreux 1973) (Reissues)

###
Amazon review: The Wall is a very underappreciated live album from the Pink Floyd.    There are many ways in which this album is superior to any other live album from the band, but the real reason I include it is the song "The Wall".  They performed this song many times during their career, including their final gig, and it is a great song.     The song is based on the David Bowie song and it does not sound like Bowie.  They are simply doing a live version of the song and it is just that good.     The song is very emotional, and the band never really plays it for the audience, they play it for themselves.    This adds a level of intimacy to the performance.     I've heard some fans say they only ever bought the CD because of the live version of this song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think the song was a little too saccharin for my taste.  I'm not going to hate on any of the Floyd catalog, but there is only so much I can take.     I've heard the live version and it is not that great, but I think I'll save my criticisms for the studio version, which I've heard many times and is far superior.     The live version is very intense and is the kind of performance I can only imagine would leave a strong impression on the band.    The song is very good, and the band is very good at it.    I don't think any one else could have pulled off this performance.  Not even the greatest band in the world.    I don't know why they only did this song live, but I think they made the best of it, and it is a great song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A nice listen to a great song, a real highlight of this live album.    The Wall is a great song and I love the live version.     The song is very good.    I'm not too big on the live version, but I will say this: the studio version is absolutely, 100% better.    The studio version is a lot of different than the live version, because they had to change the backing track, which is why the band is playing the same song but is using different instruments.  This is a great song and I will always love it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great live album, and I would classify it as "classic rock".    The album is a great mix of the most important moments of Pink Floyd's career.     This album does not have too many great songs, but the album is a great mix of the most important songs of Pink Floyd's career.    The album is a great mix of the most important songs of Pink Floyd's past three albums.    I would rate this album a 4 out of 10.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know enough to really comment on this album, other than to say that it is a great mix.    The album is a great mix.    It is very strong.

##  Pink Floyd - The Wall (Live at the Manchester Academy 1974) (Reissues)

Amazon review: The Wall has been one of my favorite live albums since I first heard it.    When I first heard the live version, I was blown away.    The song is just so powerful and emotional.    There isn't a single instrument that is overdubbed, and the band is simply playing it for themselves.    It is a great representation of a great live performance.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

My mother would often go into the kitchen and play it over and over, and this was the first time I ever heard him. I never thought he would ever become one of my favorite artists. Then, I fell in love with his first solo album, Mr. President, and then started buying up all his albums. Now, I am buying his new CD each time I get a chance to get it, and I am listening to it every day. Keith Sweat is as good as they get. He is not a kid anymore.

Amazon review: I love this song! I especially love the last line: "And Jesus is still talking to me through this microphone".  I also love that it's from a song that I listened to many times before and loved each time.  It's the most beautiful line in the whole song.  I love the story of Jesus and I believe that God is real and I love that Jesus loves me.  I love that he loves me and it fills me up so much with joy and warmth.  I also love that this song was chosen by the Lord.  (Thanks).

Amazon review: A really great song, but I could not get into it. It was too fast-paced for me.  Maybe I have not been listening to it enough.  It's an interesting concept, but it's a little too fast-paced for my taste.  I would have preferred a slower song like "My Happy Ending" or "I'm a Believer".  This would have been a great Christmas carol, but I would have preferred something a little more subtle, like "Little Drummer Boy" or "Baby Let's Play House".

Amazon review: This song reminds me of the feeling of Christmas - like a child's wish to be loved and to have someone who loves him.  The whole time I listened to this song, I kept saying "I love you".  I wish I could hear it more often so that every Christmas, I can hear it once.  The voice of the singer is very beautiful, and it really brings a feeling of joy.  The atmosphere sounds very relaxing.

Amazon review: I saw this song in a movie the other day and I loved it.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to listen to it again, I was just so moved by it, I can't wait to hear it on the radio again.  It's the only Christmas song I listen to from time to time.  The atmosphere is great and it sounds very well performed.  I love the line "I am so loved by you".  This is a Christmas song I will listen to for a long time.

Amazon review: I was just looking at the list of songs on this cd and I was wondering what song people thought was "best" then I listened to this song. I have been listening to Christmas music for a long time but this song, I think, is the first one I have been able to find that is "really" Christmas.  It's a very good song, I really like it.  It is a Christmas song that you can enjoy from beginning to end, it's like Christmas music without the Christmas.  I like it, I really like it.  I am looking forward to hearing it on the radio more often.  I have to say that this is the first Christmas CD that I have ever listened to in which I found a Christmas song that made me feel like it was Christmas.  I love it, it is Christmas music that I love and I love Christmas.  This is the first Christmas CD (and the first Christmas CD I have ever listened to) in which I have found a Christmas song that made me feel like it was Christmas.  This is the first Christmas CD that I have ever found on a CD that was really a Christmas CD.  It's a very good song, I really like it. I've always loved Christmas music, but this is very good.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this.

If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

The band's music is a little bit more complex than other bands. They have a little of the metal influence in the music.
The band's music is a little bit more complex than other bands' music, but I think it is good.
They sound like a mix between the metal bands and the rock bands. They have a good sound and the songs have a good tempo.
They are the first band that has a good style and sound for my taste.
