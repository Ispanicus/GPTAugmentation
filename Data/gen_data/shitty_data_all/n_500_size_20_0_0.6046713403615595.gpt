Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

The only thing I would say is that it really reminds me of the good ole days for me, when I was first learning how to play an instrument.

The only thing that I would change is that I think the guitars and drums should be a little more audible.  For the most part I can hear all instruments though.

Amazon review:  This album has some great songs.  The vocals are good and the music is good.  The songs are fun to listen to but the production is a little bit too much for my taste.  I know that Josh likes a lot of music but I think the production would be better without the guitar sounds.  I just think that the production is a little bit too much for me.  If the production were a little bit lower I would love this more.  The song "You And I" is great and should be played constantly.  It is a great ballad and Josh should be playing it every day.  The song "Why Wait" is by far my favorite song on the album and I would recommend it for those who like Josh Gracik.  The song "I Wish" is good and Josh should play it every day.  "What Am I Supposed To Do" is an emotional song and Josh should play it every day.  The song "I Know" is a great song and Josh should play it every day.  "The Way You Do" is a great song and Josh should play it every day.  The song "Don't Need A Reason" is a great song and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Josh Gracik.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: I've been trying to get my hands on this album, but the only thing I can find on Amazon is an MP3 download.  It's pretty bad.  The songs are really repetitive.  I'm sure I can find a better version somewhere, but it's worth a try.  It's just so bad I'm sure I'll end up buying the CD to get the MP3.  The only good song on here is probably the last one.  It's just one long song with no break in or anything.  It's just one long song with no break in or anything!

Amazon review: I've heard of several artists that have made great music, but this guy is the worst.  I've always been a fan of Slipknot, but for the most part, he's been a mediocre band.  I've always been a fan of Slipknot, but this is the worst band I've ever seen.  It's not a band I'll pay to see at a concert, it's not a band I'll pay to see at a club, and it's not a band I'll pay to see at a recording studio.  I do like a lot of other bands, but this is just a sad, pathetic, waste of time.  I hope you guys see what you've done to the music industry and take it all down a notch.

Amazon review: I just got done listening to this CD.  It's a very good CD.  I can tell you that for sure!!  I was in a very negative place for a little while but I have now found a new friend and have been able to truly express myself to a person that I have not had in a very long time. I have been told so many negative things about me.  I have been in prison for a long time now.  I am now free. I just hope that I can find some one that can accept me for who I am and help me to get back out of this world.  I have my whole life ahead of me.  I will not waste it by killing myself.

Amazon review: I have to say this is one of the best new Slipknot albums ever.  I had to buy one.

I still enjoy listening to "A Change of Heart" and the rest of their albums but this one is the best.  Keep on keepin' on.  I hope that they keep this up for a long time.

Amazon review: I am still a huge fan of Slipknot.  If they had just kept this up I would have bought the full length album for sure, but I'm glad the fans are still getting used to the band's new sound.  It's really good.  I like the new songs they are adding.  I still like the old songs that I'm sure I will be hearing for a long time to come.  I have always enjoyed listening to Slipknot, and I am looking forward to seeing the band on tour.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album! There is a lot of variety in the tracks, some I like and some I don't, but overall it has a lot of great tracks.

I think if I have to listen to any of this music again it will be this album.  I have a lot of friends who like the stuff I like, and I hope they like it too.  I will buy more CDs from this artist.  This is my favorite CD of the year! (That is, until I find out what I'm going to do this Christmas, when I really must get my Christmas shopping done.)

He is a very talented guy, and has a very good voice, and I think I like his music, I just wish that his CD was better than his other two CDs.  This one is much better than his other two CDs, they are much better than my 2 other favorite CDs that he has sold me.  I think he is not putting his best effort into this one, which is really bad for the whole CD.  His music is a lot better than his other CDs I have bought, and I think this will be one of my most favorites for a long time.

Amazon review: This is the CD I bought from the store, and I'm not really sure what to say about it.  I really like it, but I cannot tell you why.  I really like the music, but the quality is not the best.  The songs sound way better on the CD that you can get at the store, which is what I buy.

Amazon review: This is really good music.  I like the songs.  I like the singer.  I like the song, but the last few songs put me off.  I don't know what I am supposed to be listening to with this CD.  I don't like the songs.  I don't understand them.  I don't buy CD's for the music.  I buy CDs because of the songs, and these are not good songs.  I bought this CD because it had the CD of the artist that had the best reviews, and it had the name of the biggest band in the world, but that CD was not good.  I don't like country music, I don't like rock and roll, and country wasn't the reason why I bought the CD.  The songs are the reason that I bought the CD.  The songs are the reason I bought this CD.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I was surprised how much I grew to like this album. I was expecting a little more than just a "guitar player". I do enjoy the guitar solos. I do enjoy that there are solos that are not very prominent, but there are solos that are very prominent. This album is very reminiscent of the 70s. I like that there is a "bouncy" sound in the guitar solos. It is still a very guitar friendly album.

Amazon review: I have a lot of respect for the guitar playing of Billy Currington. He is a good singer, and a good songwriter. He doesn't take himself very seriously. He's very sincere. However, his music is not good. I've heard only one album from him, and it's a complete waste of time.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's an album about love, sex, and relationships.  There's a lot of references to pop culture. "This Is How We Do" is a song about the state of our relationship.  "Boomers" is about the sexual revolution of the 60s and 70s as well as a critique of modern marriage.  Of course, there are songs about "The Good Times" and "The Bad Times".  There's a lot of references to "I Feel Love" and "I've Been Expecting" with the same lyrics.  I don't like the album, but that's a good album to have in the house when you have to work and have little energy to do anything.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: used this for my uncle's funeral and the download did the job it was used for.  Not much to say about a music mp3
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: I'm giving one star because her husband joushua feuerstein telling people to give 5 star so this album can be on 10. You're husband should be in jail for stealing 30,000

Amazon review: I don't like music in mp3 format, but this one is good.  The first song, the one I've heard the most, I like it.  It's very soft, but I like it.  I think this is a great song of the year.  I think it's the perfect song to have by the end of the year.  It has some great lyrics and makes me want to listen to it more often.  I don't know if everyone likes this song or not, but I do.  It's pretty nice.  I love the little intro and the guitar solo.  I think it's from a band, but I don't know the name or anything.  I like this song.  I think if you like this song then you'll like the rest of this album.  I don't know if it's a good album or not.  But I like this song.  I didn't think there was much to like, but it's a good album.  I don't listen to this band ever.  They're not good, but I think they're pretty good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album is good but the music that makes me listen to it is the band.  I can't choose between listening to this album or listening to the music the band makes.

Amazon review:  I have never heard a more annoying song.  It is very annoying.  But I like it, but I can't even listen to it.  I just want the song to end.  It's like I can't hear the words.

Amazon review:  I was very excited to listen to this album because it had a very good song (the one I have never heard before) and a very good song (the one I have never heard before).  I am disappointed, because the other songs are just average.  A little more variety would have been nice.  I still liked it though.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: the music sucks but the album is not bad.  The songs are good, and I like listening to them over and over.  I do like the music though.  It is a good album, but I don't know if I will listen to it very often.  I do like the songs, but I don't think I will continue listening to this album either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought this was a good album from the band.  I really like the songs, but they are not very good.  I liked the band but this is not a good album from them.  I like the band a lot but this is not a good album from them.  I don't think it is a good album.  I can still hear the band, but the music is terrible.  I don't know what to say.  I don't think it is a good album.  It is pretty good, but it is not very good.  I did like the album though.  I think it is a good album.  I don't think it is a good album but it is pretty good.
