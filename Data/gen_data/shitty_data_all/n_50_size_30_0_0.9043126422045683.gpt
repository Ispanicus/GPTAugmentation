Amazon review: I have been trying to find a Christian Rock cd since the 80's and I think this is it. I love the Christian Rock genre, so I love the fact that it has Christian lyrics, but there were no Christian songs on this CD. I think the music is great, but the lyrics were terrible. I gave this cd to a friend and he absolutely loved it. So now I have a CD that he absolutely loved and a CD that I have been searching for years. I have to tell you, I was really disappointed. Sorry I wasted your money.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It's one of my favorite songs ever.  I've had it on repeat for the last 10 years.  I just listened to it and it always makes me smile.  The only other song that's ever made me feel the same way is "The Heart Attack."  I'm so thankful I bought that CD.  I'm not sure what I would have done if I lost it and had to replace it.  I'm pretty sure it would have been replaced by J.D. Souther's "You're So Vain."  I'm so thankful I have it.  I'm thankful that I have the opportunity to share it.

I had previously ordered a 'classic car' on Amazon but when I went to purchase this and it was the same price as the 'classic car', I thought I was missing out on a great deal. When I saw the price and thought 'that's a good price for a cd', I ordered it. I'm glad I did. This is the next step in my collection. This album is a great album, and there were many songs that I have already purchased. I'm not one to pay full price for albums, so this is a good purchase for me. But it's not always a good thing to purchase a CD for someone for less than you paid for it, so I'm glad I paid full price and didn't wait. I've had this cd for a couple of weeks now and I've listened to and replayed the songs, and it's become a favorite. I love the artwork and the packaging. I love the song selection. I love the way that Kelly has changed his sound over the years. The songs are more modern and new. The songs are also more varied as well. I've listened to a lot of this album over the years and it's been a longtime favorite of mine.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: This song was a lot of fun to listen to. I actually thought it could be a little more creative, but it makes up for it with the high energy dance-off that happens at the midpoint of the song.

Amazon review: This song is pretty good. I think I have listened to the song over 30 times now, and I really like it. It's a little bit different from the normal rap songs that come on iTunes, but I like it. I like the beat and lyrics. What I don't like is the constant use of the n-word. That was over a minute long. I think I would like to hear it again; especially on a different day. But the song was good and I enjoyed it.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This CD is a poor attempt by the band to get some attention.  I thought it was a pretty good effort and I'll probably buy it.  The only song they wrote that was good was "Eleanor" which was a great song.  The only song I didn't like was "I Don't Care".  The rest of the songs were okay.  I just don't understand why they put this CD out. I could understand if the band was trying to sell a CD or a tour, but this is just dumb.  I think I'll pass.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review:   I have been an avid fan of the musical artist Thalia since I saw her show with Carlos Vives at the Blue Note in New York City.  I have wanted to see her live ever since.  The show was wonderful, Thalia and her band performed a masterful rendition of      "My Favorite Things."  Thalia sings and plays the piano, she is a gifted vocalist and an accomplished pianist.  I was impressed by her voice and her talent.  Thalia's voice is a powerful thing.  I really wanted to hear more of her music so when I heard that she was releasing a CD in the fall of this year, I had to get it.  I wish she would do more live shows.  I only hope that her career as a singer and pianist continues.  If you have not heard her music,  go and buy one of her albums.  They are terrific.  I recommend you to at least listen to the CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is by far the worst album I have ever purchased, ever!!  The only good thing was the music, which was the only good thing on this album.  The rest was absolute garbage.  The rap (I know, it's sooo bad to have a rap but it's the only good thing) was so bad it was barely listenable.  The rest of the album was so bad I couldn't believe my ears.  I had to take the cd out of the player and go listen to it in the library because it was driving me nuts. I will not be buying any more of this crap and will stop buying all their other crap.  You can get this crap anywhere, by any means and by any artist and it will be a waste of time.  And that's if this album doesn't end up being an album of the year.  I would suggest you avoid this album and all the others they have released in the past.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD to replace the one I lost in the move back to my parents house and its replacement disc was the same.  In my opinion it was not worth the money, if you love rap then you will enjoy this.  The rap is nice but not worth spending money on.  The rest of the album is very average, but you can't expect anything from a rap album, you can't expect it to be good.  There are quite a few different rappers on this album and they all have their individual styles.  I didn't care for any of them and that's my opinion, I just didn't like them.  The rest of the album is very average.  The only good things on this album are the music and the hiphop and that's about it.  The rest of the album is so generic and unoriginal, it's a waste of time to listen to this album.  It's not worth the money,  it's a waste of your time.  I would suggest not buying this cd.  If you like rap that is it.  I would recommend the only good thing is the music, if you really like rap then you will love this album.

Amazon review: I am sure this is a great album.  I am not familiar with the artist.  I am sure this album has good production.  There are a few tracks that I like.  Most of them are mediocre or average.  There are a few tracks that are pretty good.  The only song that I like is "I Know You Wanna".  It's not the best song on the album but it is a pretty good song.  There are a couple others that are good but not great.  Overall this is very average and average is still good.  You could go into this album and listen to it over and over again.  You could play this one on your own and really enjoy it.  You could bring it with you to your next party.  You could buy it as a gift.  You could listen to it in your car.  It could be on the radio at any time of the day.  For these reasons I would say it's about average.  It's not as bad as Nelly's "Thrift Shop".  It's not as good as "Satisfaction" by Nelly.  It's not as good as "The Greatest".  It's not as good as "The Best of the Best".  It's not as good as "So Fresh".  It's not as good as "So Fresh".  It is not as good as "Empire State of Mind".  It's not as good as "What's Going On".  It's not as good as "What's Going On".

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: If I could give it 5 stars, I would. It is a great song and the only reason I would give it 5 stars, is because I think they should release it on CD. The reason I won't give it 5 stars, is because on CD you have to put it on the CD, and there is a chance that the CD goes bad. On CD, it is on a CD, how can you lose it? So on CD, I would put it on the CD with the rest of the music. I would give it 5 stars, because I think it is a great song.

I am really surprised by the negative reviews. I don't see how I am supposed to be excited about a music video that is a parody of a video game. And to be honest, I don't even see how the song fits in with the movie. Anyway, I still like the song and I am going to make sure to listen to it again. Thanks for taking the time to write a review.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This is a good album.  The CD is filled with a couple of good songs and an excellent number of mediocre ones.  The CD is worth owning if you like country.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is a great album, even though it isn't a masterpiece.  I have been listening to this album for about 2 weeks now.  I have really enjoyed the music, and I have been able to apply it to several areas of my life.    For example, this is a very effective way to learn to write a song.  It helped me to learn how to write a song, and it gave me some very good ideas to help me write songs, but it was more than that.  I have been able to apply this knowledge to my guitar playing, to my voice and to almost any part of my life.    I've been able to think of new ways to solve problems, and I have been able to see some of my fears and insecurities.  I have also been able to be more positive and to be more cheerful.  Every now and then I have even been able to be more of a leader in my family.    I don't know how I would ever get the time or the energy to listen to this album, if I did listen to it all the time.  But I do know that there is no better place for it than here.  If you are looking for a positive, uplifting CD, this is a great one.

Amazon review: This CD is music to the ears and heart.  It was a very special album to hear.  "Lion" is my favorite track.  I think it is the best song on this CD and it is certainly the most pleasant to listen to.    The music here is what I would call'soulful' music.    There is no doubt in my mind that this group has musical talent.  And they can play a musical instrument.    I was very impressed with the amount of instrumental solos on this album.  The first solos on the album were very good.  As the album progressed, the solos became more varied. There were solos that included the use of all of the instruments and the solos that were only on one instrument.    The use of multiple instruments on this album was done very well.  The entire album was very cohesive, and I was very impressed with how well the individual musicians were able to work together.    The use of this ensemble on the album was masterful.    Even with only two musicians, it was able to add a great deal of depth to the music.    The two musicians on the album are able to play the instruments at the same time and they are able to interact with each other and with the audience.  It can be difficult for a performer to have to be on his solo or performance at the same time.  But these two were able to do it and they were able to do it well.    The two musicians were able to work together well and to complement each other.    I was very impressed with the quality of the music on this album.  It was very moving and it was very uplifting.  I felt that I was able to see some of my dreams and even some of my fears.  I was able to remember some of them, and I was able to learn some new ways to live.    I enjoyed the music on this CD very much.  This was a very special and an extremely positive listening experience.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times since I got it about a week ago.  I haven't been able to put it down.  I have to admit that I am a very picky listener.  I like to listen to music that I know is going to be good.  I have been listening to this CD for about a week now, and I still don't know exactly what it is.    I am not sure what to call it.  It is not a CD of great music or a masterpiece.  It is not a great rock album.  It is not a great pop album.  It is not a great jazz album.  It is not a great classical album.  It is not a great country album.  It is not a great blues album.  It is not a great folk album.  It is not a great folk-rock album.  It is not a great rock-pop album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Excellent album.  This was the first album I purchased after learning about R&B.  And it was perfect for me.  I just wish there was more music from this era.  I was listening to the album again last night and came across this song.  I'm totally hooked.  It really fits the theme of the movie.  The album is good.  The musicianship of the musicians is excellent.  The lyrics are great.  The vocals are great.  There is not one track that I found to be dull.  It's just that the songs are so short and the vocalist is so good that you need to sit thru the whole thing.  The lyrics are beautiful and the arrangement is so well thought out.  It is a great album for this time of year.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
