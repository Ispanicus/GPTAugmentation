Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: It's really hard to pick just one.  I do not like either of these.  They each have their place, but I think the way it's put together is a poor choice.  This is a live concert recording...not a studio recording.  I have to think that the sound quality of this performance is a little bit too good.  The high end was a little too loud for me and the low end was a little too soft.  The mix is not clear and the sound is not great.  I think the sound quality is a little too good.  The only good thing I could say about this recording is that I love Keith Sweat.  I love his music and he is a gifted singer.  I don't like this recording because I don't like the sound quality.  This is a live performance.  It doesn't have to sound as good as if it was recorded in a studio.  Keith Sweat is a great singer and a great performer.  I just don't think this recording is appropriate for a live performance.  I would have preferred to have a studio recording.

Amazon review: I love this CD. It's one of my favorites.  I like the music a lot.  Like I said, I love Keith and his music a lot.  I don't think they did justice to this CD.  The sound quality is not that great for a live recording.  Some of the songs are a little bit too loud for the live performance.  I don't think the mix works well.  The sound is too much.  There is too much bass in some of the songs.  The vocals are a little too loud.  The bass in some of the songs is too much.  The mix is bad.  I don't like the sound quality.

Amazon review: I have seen Keith Sweat on many occasions.  I would not say he was a great singer back in the day.  He has always shown his limitations with his singing.  I found him very talented.  In my opinion, Keith Sweat is one of the best singers of all time.  His voice is a wonderful instrument.  He has always sang at his best when he was in his 20's.  When he was in his 30's he was a little better.  His voice is still great.  You can tell his voice is a beautiful instrument by just listening to what he has to say.  I just don't like this recording.  It's a true live performance.  The sound quality is not great.  The mix is not clear and the sound is not great. I really like Keith Sweat. I just don't like this recording.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: This is probably a stupid question because I am not sure if this is the same or a different album.  It is probably the same album because it has the same cover and everything.

They should make a new album.  It has a real interesting sound. So, if you like that movie then you will probably like this.

Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: IMO, this sounds like something I could've done with a toy saxophone.  Awful.  Listen to the previews.  If you can get passed the samples and think its sounds great, then go for it.

Amazon review:  This album is pure garbage.  Not a single tune made it through to the second half.  The organ sounds like the sound of a cheap toy.  The solos are good, but they are nowhere near as good as their instrumentals.  Even the backing vocals sound like they are made of plastic.  The lyrics are terrible, and I'm not sure I understand what's even supposed to be happening.  I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this stuff, but it was a waste of my time and money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  A very good album, though the production is a little too slick and the music a bit too smooth for my liking.  The organ and accordion are a little too soft, and the vocals too soft.  The songs are very short and you can't really get a good sense of how long each song is before you start to wonder if you're going to get to the end.  This album is good, it just doesn't fit its description.  At least you can't say it doesn't fit its description.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Great album, but it's not what I expected.  The vocals are very good, but the songs aren't as good as I expected them to be.  The solos are good, but the instrumentals aren't.  The song that is closest to what I imagined is "The World is Going to End in 2012", but the other songs are much better.  The album is very good, but the production is off.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a very good album.  If you like hard rock, you will like this album.  It's a great album with great production and excellent vocals.  It's a very good album.

Amazon review:  It's not a bad album.  It's just not a very good album.  This album is the best thing on it's own.  But the quality of the other albums in the band does a very poor job of selling it.  The album is good, but the album itself is not.

Amazon review:  I was hoping to like this, but I've just listened to it a few times and I'm not sure I'm going to.  I don't know how I'm going to get around the songs that sound like they could be written for a pop band, and I don't know how I'm going to get around the songs that seem to be nothing more than throwaway filler.  I don't know how I'm going to get around the fact that this album is just too long and repetitive.  I don't know how I'm going to get around the idea that this album is just a little too slick.  I don't know how I'm going to get around the song that sounds like it could have been written for a pop group in the 70's.

Amazon review:  This isn't really a review.  It's more like a list of things that are good about this album.  I'm not going to listen to it until I can find something that's a little more positive to say about it.  This is not a great album, and it's not a bad album, but it's neither.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review:  I'm very disappointed (if this is the way to go) with the re-release of the album.   I've only played the first 3 songs and they are really good.

I love the original version, but I do wish the re-release were better.

Amazon review: When I saw the cover and the title "The Sound of Music",  I was expecting something like "The Sound of Music".   But this isn't it.

Amazon review:  I really liked the first 3 tracks.   But the next 4 tracks just don't sound like the music I've heard on the first 3 songs.   I don't have a problem with the original recording, but the original was a lot better than this cover.    I don't understand the rationale behind the decision to release this cover over the original.   The original recording sounds more like "Viva la Vida",  which is what I wanted, and the cover just sounds like a cover.

Amazon review:  The most recent CD (2002) is not an upgrade over the previous releases.  The music has much more of a "rock" feel to it.  There is a good amount of distortion and the songs don't sound as well recorded as on the previous CD.  The guitar and organ sound more like the classic rock sound.  It's more of a "dance" album than the previous recordings.  The vocals sound a little too clean and the songs don't sound as well written.  The album is still a good listen and provides a good mix of rock and pop.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The boys have been busy over the past year or so.  They've been trying to get their message out to the world.  Their new CD, "All We Need Is Love" is a great introduction to their music.  The musicianship is top-notch and the songs are an interesting fusion of rock and pop.

Amazon review: The band's new music sounds like it was recorded on an analog tape machine, and the vocals sound like they were recorded in a home studio.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.

I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

The lyrics are somewhat obscure, and that might be the reason why the song doesn't stick with me.  I'm quite sure that some of my listeners would love to know what the song's about.  I think that this is a very good song, but I don't really remember it.  The other song that I like here, however, is "What They Don't Know."  I think that this song is great.  The song's lyrics are extremely insightful and poetic.  The music is great, and the lyrics are very beautiful.  The song's message is very beautiful, as well.

At first I was a little confuse about how the words appeared on the album, but I realized that they are actually written in the album booklet.  The lyrics are all over the place, and I don't know why, but they are very poetic.  The music is great, the production is awesome and the vocals are excellent.  The only problem with this album, is the lack of songs that people would remember.  The songs that are on this album, are great, but some of the songs, you just can't find them on the radio that much.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!

I feel it is deserving of at least an excellent rating.

Review: THE BAND THAT SUCKS!

by Anonymous

Amazon review: I was so excited to hear Pink Floyd's "The Wall" on my new Pink Floyd CD, that I bought it and listened to it through a speaker for the first time.  I must admit that I was disappointed from the first note.

I have never been a Floyd fan, despite the fact that I've been listening to them for years.  However, in the past I have always been a fan of Pink Floyd.

This album is a collection of studio recordings that I found on my CD player at home.  I thought that these recordings were good, and had a decent message.  I thought that they were more commercial than other Pink Floyd albums that I have heard.  There was a definite message in each song and I found them to be quite good.

However, I was shocked by the vocals that I heard. They were not Floyd's trademark voice, and they came out as fake.  The sounds of the vocals were very odd, and came out as if they were recorded on a toy microphone.  I am very disappointed with Floyd's music.

I hope that this review will help others who are disappointed by Floyd's music.

Review: THE LIGHT IS SHINING

by Anonymous

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Pink Floyd since I was a teenager.  My favorite Pink Floyd albums include "Money" (from Pink Floyd's debut album), "The Wall" and "The Dark Side of the Moon."  In fact, I even have a collection of my own Pink Floyd albums, including "A Saucerful of Secrets" and "The Wall."

I bought this CD by mistake.  I was surprised to find that there was a Pink Floyd CD on the same CD shelf as Pink Floyd's greatest hits collection.  I had to listen to this disc several times to make sure that I was not mistaken.

This album's message is that this is a great band, but they are not as great as they once were.  I had to admit that I was wrong.  The recording on this album was fantastic.  They are back in their prime.  This is a great Pink Floyd album.

Review: THE BROTHERHOOD OF MUSIC

by Anonymous

Amazon review: This album is not as good as "A Saucerful of Secrets" (Pink Floyd's third album) or "The Wall."  However, it's better than "A Momentary Lapse of Reason" (Pink Floyd's second album) and "Money" (Pink Floyd's debut album).  The message in this album is much better than in those other two albums.

I really liked "The Wall."  That was a very good album.  However, I am disappointed that this album has a message.  The message is very different than that of "The Wall."

"The Wall" is a great album by Pink Floyd.  My only regret is that it doesn't have the same impact as the other albums.  I like it a lot, but I think it would be cool to hear it live.

Amazon review: This album is so much better than its predecessor, "Money," that I am seriously considering re-wording this review.  I don't want to sound like the guy who complains about the fact that he had to give this album a negative review.

This is a great album.  I love the music, the message is good and the recording is fantastic.  However, this is not a great album.  I think they should have left out "Money."  This is a great album however.  I definitely recommend this album

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: When I heard that album the first time I thought, "Wow! That's a good album." Then I listened to it a few more times and realized it was a bad album. Now I'm not sure the best albums are ever good albums. But this one is good.

Amazon review: I have never been a big fan of Pink Floyd so this album was a very pleasant surprise. I would have expected it to be a very good album. It has so many things going for it. The music is wonderful. The lyrics are brilliant. I have already seen a lot of the songs and they are all very good. This is a good album for a rainy day.

Amazon review: When it debuted, this album was supposed to be a Christmas album, but it ended up being an album that was perfect for every day of the year. Even though the album is a Christmas album, it has very much in common with other album's like "A Christmas Carol" or "Frosty the Snowman". This album is just very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really disappointed with this album. There is not a single good song on this album. I don't think the album could have been any worse. The lyrics are all poorly written. The writing is not good. The music is not good. The bass line is the worst bass line I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.  I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the show out there.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: I was surprised to hear that this CD was "designed" by the musician, since i had only heard the songs that were being played. However, i was not expecting much. The songs are well written, the musicianship is good, and the songs are well performed. This CD is a real ear pleasing release. The songs are very well performed and are filled with emotion. I am very pleased with the work that has been put into this CD, and i have recommended it to many people who are fans of this artist.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Great CD for those who like the music of Celine Dion, Barbra Streisand, or Barry Manilow.  Very well produced, and the songs are very well sung. The only drawback is that the CD, because of the songs of Celine Dion, is very short. I was hoping that the CD would be longer, but I am glad that it is not.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Loved this CD the first time i heard it in the store.  Well worth the money.  The songs are all very well played, and the songs are very well performed. The only draw back is that some of the songs are only 4 or 5 minutes long. I don't mind it, because i like it.

Amazon review: I'm pretty sure that the album "Man of La Mancha" should have been included with the CD.  The songs are all well performed, and the performances are all very well done. The musicianship is good, the arrangements are good, and the production is good. I just don't understand why they would not have included the album with the CD. The album is a true work of art.
