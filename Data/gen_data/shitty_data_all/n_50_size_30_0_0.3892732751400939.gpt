Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: There are so many great songs on this CD.  I think that this one is awesome because of the lyrics.  They are all about self-reliance.  They are so positive and I really like the song "Hardened Heart"  and I like "My Way".  "Dumb" is my least favorite song on the CD.  "Lazy" is my favorite.  "Blessed" is a great song.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Troy - July 24, 2009

I think this was my favorite album released by the Manhattan Transfer. I thought it was really catchy, and the lyrics were a really nice touch that added a little more to the song. It was also a really cool album that you could listen to over and over again.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is a great song, but how can a song be great when it's so badly done? It's just a mess.  If I'm going to listen to a song that's going to be on the radio on a regular basis I want it to be good.  But this is not good and I cannot recommend it to anyone who is not into hip hop.

Amazon review: It's not bad, but it's not good either.  It's just a rap song.  The problem with most rap songs is that they are just written to sound like rap music.  In this case, it's written to sound like nothing more than a rap song without rhyme.  It's like putting two different rap songs on a CD.

Amazon review: Hip-hop is the greatest music ever made.  But most of it is just so poor when it comes to rhymes.  There is no rhyme in this song.  It's just like the first song on CD2.  I could have sworn that the words in this song were going to rhyme, but they don't.  The last ten seconds of the song are just a bunch of words with no sound accompanying them.  It just seems like the words are just there so that the singer can say them.

Amazon reviews: This song is so good, and there's so many of them, that I am going to have to stop and go out and buy it all.  This is the best thing on this CD.  The lyrics are really good, and the music is really good.  But the song just seems like an album filler and not a strong song.

Amazon review: The music is on point, the lyrics are on point, the production is on point and the flow is on point.  But the lyrics aren't really what you'd expect from a hip-hop song.  They are not "real" hip-hop lyrics.  They just are just lyrics.  And that's fine.  It's just like buying a CD that's just a rap CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Thank you for the detailed review and your comments on the music. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the recording.

I also want to say that the recording quality is great and is better than many of the CDs in this genre. I also appreciate your comments on the voice quality and the recording quality. I do not think that we could have a better product or customer service than the one we get from your company.

I hope that you find the Schubert songs on this CD enjoyable too.

Thank you again for the detailed review and your comments.

When you are not reviewing music, you are not reviewing anything.

If you are simply reading a review of a video game, you're not reviewing anything at all.

That is not how an honest review of a product should be written.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I love the music of Robert Johnson, but this disc is a poor attempt to do the same thing. I wish he could have just done more of the same shit that everyone else has done. I also wish he would have just done more of his own songs. There's nothing here that is great. I feel like I was sucked into this album. It's not like he did anything really original, and yet it was marketed to me like I was going to be impressed by it. So far I am not impressed.

Amazon review: It is nice to hear some positive reviews of a song that is considered to be one of the greatest blues songs of all time(solo ) and one of my favorite songs all time(The Ballad of John and Yoko).  I really like how Robert Johnson sings The Ballad of John and Yoko, I know my opinion won't be different from most of you.  But I really like this song.  It is nice to hear someone so positive about this song. I have seen some of the songs he sings and I have never seen someone so positive about this song, it really is a nice song. I have been to this site many times since I have started listening to Robert Johnson as well as all the other great artists.

Amazon review: I don't understand why people are so negative about this album.  It is still a great album and the song is still great.  The guy is a great singer.  He is an amazing person and deserves more than we can give him.  He deserves all the success he has had.  I think he has done all he can do, but he still has to be appreciated.  All he has done is just write some really good songs.  He has no talent, no money, no fame, no nothing.  He is just a guy trying to make a living writing songs and trying to make a name for himself.  All he has is his talent from the talent he has, and it is good he has that.  I think he is just doing what most people do, trying to write songs, trying to get to a better spot in life.  I really think that he should stop writing songs and just try living his life.  I don't think he has any talent for writing songs.  I just don't get the negative feedback.  How can someone who loves this music write a negative review about a great album?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I love to play this CD.  It is my go-to for practice.  I know it is a little cheesy...but it still rocks!  The sax player (Jeffrey) has an amazing tone and voice.  His singing is also exceptional.  I have tried to sing this song in front of him and he still gets me.  I think he is a little over-the-top with the lyrics.  I have not tried to sing this song in front of other singers.  I have heard that this song is considered a little too suggestive for many singers.  I have sung this song with a male vocalist and he was not very impressed with it.  I have sung this song with a female vocalist and she said it was pretty good.

Amazon review: It's been so long that I have forgotten the name of this song.  I was really excited to discover that it was by a member of the Fugees.  I don't know if I can go back and get the CD, but I do think I know a version of it.  The music is really cool and I don't think we have a better song on the CD than this.  The sax and drumming on the CD are great.  I am starting to get a tad tired of Tuxedo Junction, but the sax is so good that I think I will still like it.  I am excited to see what the sax player will bring to the table.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: There is not a lot of great singing on this CD.  There are a couple of vocalists who are amazing, but it is not a great singing group.  You will find that this vocalists' voices are a little weak.  I think that some of the other vocalists have a better range and the range of the sax player is a little bit better than the other singers.  Some of the singers need to work on their tone.  I like most of the singers on this CD, but I don't think this group will take me over.  I would like to put this CD on my list of favorites.

Amazon review:  I was surprised when I ordered this CD because I heard that it was cheesy...but after listening to it, I don't think so.  The sax player has a good range and the drummer is good.  I am going to order another CD for my kids, but I think it is a little long.  The song is really good.  I like most of the singers.  The sax player is a good vocalist.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  This song tells a story about a man who was afraid of his wife.  He told her he did not want to live with her anymore  He would leave.  She said,  "I love you".  He said, "No you don't",  and ran out of the house.  She saw him and said,  "I love you".  He said,  "No you don't",  and he ran out of the house.  She went back to her house and as she was eating she said,  "I love you",  and she put a rose on the table and said.  "I love you too".  This is a powerful story about the faith that women have in God.  If you want to be free you need to let go.  One thing that I find to be true is that a good marriage is a work in progress.  I highly recommend this song.

And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I don't like singing along to Bob, and I don't like singing along to Jewel either. I don't like singing along to any of them. They are just all alike. I do not like singing along to them. I do not like the way they sing. I don't like the way they sound. Its just awful. I think I will pass this CD.

Amazon review: This album is horrible. I don't like Jewel's singing. I don't like her act either. I don't even know what to say about it.

Jewel is like a singer who only sings one song. I don't like her singing but then again I don't like her singing. I don’t like her act either. I don’t even know what to say about it.

Jewel is like an artist who only sings one song. She sings in the same way that a singer who sings only one song (a pop song). The song should be a pop song, which is why I don't like her singing. But I didn't like the song, so I didn't like the song. I don't even know what to say about the album.

To all of you, I'm sorry that you didn't like the song, but I'm sorry at the same time that I didn't like the song. I listened to the album a few times, and it's still awful. I don't know what to say about it.

I don't know what to say about the album. I can't believe that Jewel took this horrible album and changed the songs. I'm sorry but I just don't get it. I really don't like this album.

I didn't think the man was a rocker at first. But then I saw him on the news and it was like, wow, what has happened to this guy? I didn't know who he was, but I saw him on the news and he seemed to be a rocker and now he is just a punk rocker. I was like, wow, that is so cool. He is a rocker. He is a rocker. He is a rocker.

And the way he got his name, it makes me think of a rocker, right? Someone who has made it to the top of the mountain, and now they are looking down at everyone else and saying, "I am a rocker, you are a punk rocker, I am a rocker and you are a punk rocker." But the thing that makes me think of him is that he is all around us and everybody else is just a punk rocker. He is a rocker. He is a rocker and he is a punk rocker.

I got it and it was a good book. I was about 8 years old and I loved it. I was happy to see it and I loved it. I started to cry and I was happy. I loved it and I remember looking through my sister's CD's and the songs I liked were in the same order. I was happy to find this CD and I was thankful for it when I didn't get to give it back to my dad.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to listen to it to find out what I liked and dislike and to find out how Meghan Trainor compares to others such as Taylor Swift and JLo.  The CD is good but not great it has a bunch of songs that I like but I don't really like a lot of other songs.  I want to like it but I just can't.  I would recommend this CD to a friend who is looking for a new artist but don't buy it for yourself.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought the cd because I was drawn to Meghan's song and it was a song I had not heard before.  I liked it but I didn't think it was a song I'd be able to listen to for hours on end and I wasn't able to listen to it that long.  I think I need to listen to another song first.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought it to see what the new Meghan Trainor would be like.  I think she is talented, but I don't think this cd is for me.  I think she is more than talented, but her songs are not for me.  I think I need to listen to other artists.  If you like the style of music then buy it.  But if you don't like it then don't buy it.  I would recommend it to a friend who likes to sing and maybe to a friend who likes to listen to other artists that sing.

Amazon review: I got this because I wanted to try something different.  I really like some of the songs, but I also really dislike a lot of the songs.  I don't think I will buy this cd again and I don't think I will buy a cd from the same artist again.  If I don't like it I will not buy it.

Amazon review: I bought Meghan Trainor's cd because I thought it would be different than what I was hearing.  I was not disappointed.

Amazon review: I bought 3 cd's after I saw the release of Meghan Trainor.  I bought them because I thought they were different.  I bought them because I liked some of the songs and I did not like the songs.  I liked the way songs were sung and the music and lyrics as well as the vocals.  I was not disappointed with the songs I listened to.  I did not think other artists would sing the same way.  I like Meghan Trainor's voice and songs but I do not think that she will be able to attract the same audience as Taylor Swift.  I think she will attract a different audience and I think she will do better as an artist.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: It's a song about a man who has always known that he is gay. It's not always easy being gay, especially in the closet. But this song is a good song. I was hoping that if I listened to it more often I would be able to hear it in my head without having to hear it in my head. However, I have heard it in my head many times. The last time I listened to it I realized that I was not gay. I am gay but I don't have a problem with people being gay. It just doesn't bother me. I am a little bit of a traditionalist in the sense that I believe that people should be treated the same no matter what their sexual orientation is. I would hope that this song has the same effect.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: For me, this album is about the life of a young person who is doing everything to live to the fullest. But I have to agree with the other reviewers who say it is a little boring. I don't feel like I can sing along with this song. It just comes back to me like a memory.

I will not say more on the subject, as there are many reviews on this CD.

Amazon review: I was very happy to see this CD come out. I love it when the lyrics are more than the words.

I can't wait to see what the next CD will sound like.

Amazon review: As a writer, I am always searching for a balance between the lines and in the end I have to choose the line. As long as you don't get too far out of line then you are fine. This CD had a few songs that were not up to the standards that I am used to, but that is to be expected. I think that I have heard the best songs from this CD. I would say that this CD is the best CD of all time, bar none. It is better than the Beatles and better than the Rolling Stones. I am pretty sure that their last CD was better than this one. This CD will be the one that is played at weddings, funerals, bar/bat/dance parties, and any other occasion. If I were a betting man, I would say that the last CD that I would buy is the one that comes up on this list.
