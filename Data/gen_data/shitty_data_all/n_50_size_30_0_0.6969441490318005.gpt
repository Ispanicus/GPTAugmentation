Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: My first CD from Amazon, I am very happy. Not bad, not great, not average, but I would recommend it to anyone, especially those who have some experience with the piano. I have played in a church band and can play well, but there was no real challenge in this exercise. I am not really good at it at all. Overall, good exercise.

Amazon review: I just ordered this song from Amazon. I am not a music or film buff so I didn't know much about it, only that it was by a famous composer and it was a piano solo. I am not a big fan of music videos so I didn't know much about it either. I was surprised to find out that there was a video of this song. So I clicked on it and it took me in the beginning of the video. The video was over 30 minutes long and very well made. I am not going to describe the video as I didn't understand what it was all about. I would have liked to have seen the whole thing. I am not sure if it was because of the video or the song. I have had this song on my iPod and I love it, but I didn't purchase it for the video. For the price I paid, the song is well worth it.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

The video is so inspirational and has a great message. The song is great and fits well with the theme of the show. I hope they come out with a second cd.

Amazon review: This is my new favorite song! I love how empowering the lyrics are and how inspiring the video is! The song is perfect for a show like "The Good Wife". I love the message behind the song. It's a great song to sing at the top of your lungs and to put on the radio. The song is so catchy and fun to dance to. It's not too corny, but has a wonderful message of self-empowerment and positive thinking. I would love to see a second CD of this song!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is a strange album, I love this stuff and I am a huge Hall & Oats fan, but this was the first time I have felt like the record just didn't hit me with the emotion or the passion it needed to. I have been on a 3 record download binge for the last few weeks as a result of that. It is like I am watching a movie, the music and lyrics have the same effect on me as the movie. When I hear this song I am in the movie, and when I put on the album I am in the movie. It is a strange experience.

Amazon review: I got this album on my birthday and I can't get over how amazing this is.  It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's overrated.  There are a couple of great tracks, but the songs are either mediocre to bad (I'm looking at you, A Nightingale Sang in the Barkley Square) or just plain bad (see the one by the end, Manhattan Transfer).  The production is also a letdown, the song is just too weak to produce this album (I'm looking at you, Tuxedo Junction).  
The only good thing is that there is some of the most amazing, beautiful sounds you could possibly get.  The songs cover a good range of styles, and they are all over the place musically, and they are all incredible.  I love this album, I couldn't put it down and I can't wait for the next cd to come out.  It's just an amazing album.  I highly recommend it.

What a great way to start the summer!  If you're a fan of the 80's music you really need to check this band out.  I've been listening to this band for over a year.  They started out as a group of four high school friends who liked the same music such as "Girlfriend" by Prince, but later they decided to start a group and they were on MTV and they were on every single music show and they received over 30 awards for their music.  They were also on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine's "The 25 Greatest New Artists of All Time" and they were the first band on the cover.

I really want to get a CD of this band.  However, I have to wait until they get a chance to tour again.  There are four

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: This song is amazing and the music is great.  But, the lyrics are horrible, and the song is not what it is billed to be.  It's a good thing the conductor doesn't sing the song.  I found this review because of reviews of the album on Amazon.com.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great song, but I don't like the lyrics.  It's a sad song that talks about a girl leaving her boyfriend.  But, it's all about the fact that the guy is going to get killed.  The words aren't appropriate for the song.  It's just weird.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song has been a fan favorite for years.  The only reason I didn't buy it is because I just couldn't find a less-than-3-minute version.  But that one is here.  Very catchy.  Love this one.  Thanks Amazon.

Amazon review: The music is very good.  The lyrics and vocals are very good.  The music is an upbeat and happy song.  It's easy to dance to.

Amazon review: This is my second purchase of this album.  I bought it because I heard the song while watching the show last night.  I also thought it was a great song.  I didn't know it was from Hall and Oats until I found it on Amazon.  I have purchased albums from Amazon a few times and have never been disappointed.  I just wish the lyrics on the album were a bit more descriptive.  I am going to buy the rest of the album because I enjoy listening to it.

Amazon review: The song is awesome, but there are a few things that might bother you.  For one thing, the song is too short.  It's only about 2 minutes long.  The second thing is the lyrics.  First of all, the words are a bit hard to understand.  Sometimes there are words that sound the same but are spelled differently.  And that's not the only thing.  Sometimes the words can be misinterpreted.  For example, I thought that the word "forever" meant "until we meet again."  But, it actually means "forever and always."  The third thing is the song is not about a girl getting killed.  It's about a guy getting murdered.  He doesn't seem to be a very nice guy.  And the last thing is the last chorus.  There is a line that says "I've been waiting for you all my life."  My guess is that the guy is waiting for his dead girlfriend to come back home.  He doesn't want to wait for her to come home.  He wants to kill her so that she can't come back.  The song is about the guy being in love with his dead girlfriend.  And that's the last thing that I would want to hear.  If this song were about a girl getting murdered, I would be all for it.  But the song is about the guy waiting to kill his girlfriend.  I can't take the song seriously because it's not about a girl getting killed.  I'm not sure anyone would buy this song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs.  It's a very good song.  I like the first verse.  But, the song doesn't hold up to the second verse.  The lyrics are terrible.  It's a very sad song.  The song isn't about a girl getting killed.  It's about a guy waiting for his girlfriend to come home.  I don't like the song.  It's terrible.  There are no words that make sense.  There are a lot of words that sound the same.  But the last thing is that the song is an opera with the chorus just singing the last word.  It just doesn't make sense.  It doesn't fit the song.  This song is definitely not for everyone.  I think that this is a great song with a great message.  It's a very happy song.  But, it's not about a girl getting killed.  It's about a guy waiting to get his girlfriend back.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song can be a little annoying.  It's only about 2 minutes long and it's a song about a guy who gets murdered.  The song is not for me.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Thalia is just a pretty face.  She sings a few songs and her voice is not amazing.  The songs are all about her insecurities and not about God.  The music just does not have any substance.  If you like your music to have a message, you will be let down.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD and it is very well done.  I enjoy the songs and the songs are well thought out and the vocals good.  I would like to know more about the songs.

Amazon review: This CD is very well recorded.  I do not understand why no one would record a live worship album using their own voice.  The songs are very well done.  I really enjoyed listening to this CD.  It was well done and I believe would be a good worship CD for the family.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I find it incredible that the CD is from the same label as Lecrae's "The Remains Of The Day"   He is a great singer,  He is not good at singing gospel.  He is a great singer of the music of the greats like Stevie Wonder,  Marvin Gaye,  Aretha Franklin,  Marvin Gaye and James Brown.  He can sing any style of music.  He is a very talented man.  I really like his music.  His voice is not as good as Lecrae's but he is better than the other singers.  I wish more gospel artists would take a chance on creating a worship album that would be performed live.  I really enjoyed this CD and I believe it would be a good worship CD even for the family.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is a CD of original worship music from the most talented worship leader in the world.  He does not have an album dedicated to worship music.  He does not need one.  He does not need to have a "gospel album" to have a great worship album.  He sings many great worship songs.  He does not need to sing "gospel" songs to have a great worship album.  He is the best worship leader in the world and has done well with the songs he has sung.  He does not need worship songs to have a good worship album.  I am a gospel singer and have been singing songs by Lecrae,  Marvin Gaye,  Aretha Franklin,  James Brown,  and other great gospel singers for over thirty years.  I have made many worship albums.  I have made several worship albums and have had a wonderful time doing so.  I have had to face many problems with a label that could not understand gospel music.  I have had to face the problem of not being able to find the right labels that could understand my music.  I have had to do my best to keep making gospel albums that are well received and that have made people happy.  I have had to struggle with the label and have had to face the problem of getting my music taken out of the country.  I have faced the problem of the labels not getting my music played.  I have had to face the problems of getting my music played.  I have had to face the problem of not being able to sell my music or even get it heard.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: "Casting Crowns" is an incredible new album from the legendary band Danzig. In fact, their new album is arguably the best of the genre.  And it is not just any old album, it is the best of the genre.  And it is certainly the best album from any band in the genre since the early days of the genre.  As I was listening to this album, I thought that the band had recorded an incredible and very accomplished album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: She is a very talented songwriter. I liked her first album quite a bit, but I'm glad that she decided to release a new album. This new album is good, but it's a good album. However, the songs have nothing to do with the next album. I would rather listen to a song that I like that's from the next album. I love Meghan, but this album was just not for me. I think I will re-listen to Meghan Trainor's previous album. I'm not going to stop listening to her, as long as she releases a new album.

Amazon review: I thought this album was good, and not as good as I thought it would be, but I still think she is a very talented artist.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The first time I listened to this I was under the impression that it would be a movie soundtrack. I was pleasantly surprised when the very first song I heard was "What a Feeling" by The Eagles. The song does not have a soundtrack, but it has been recorded by many musicians and singers of different genres. The song is very good and I felt like I was in a recording studio with the band playing in the background. It's a great song that I hope is not taken away from the movie but still plays in the movie. The rest of the songs are all great. I would suggest that if you are not a movie buff that this album is not for you.

I am in love with a man and he is my master, the only one who can make me feel good about myself. He is beautiful and smart and sweet. When he turns that smile to me I feel like I can do anything. When he smiles at me, I feel like a new woman. And when he turns me on I feel like a goddess.
I have been trying to be good, for years. I have tried to be a good girl and be a good wife. I am very good at being a good wife, I am a better wife than any woman on the planet. But it gets harder and harder. He is a master, the man I love and he makes me feel so good inside. I don't want to live without him. But I have been down this road before.
