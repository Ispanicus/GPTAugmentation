Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I bought this song on Amazon because I like the song and I liked the book. I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm sorry to say, the song is awful. It's so poor I might be wrong, but I think I'm right. I listened to the song over and over and over, and then I realized that I had to delete it from my Amazon account, because the only way I would listen to it again would be if I actually bought it. I wish it never came to my attention that it was such a terrible piece of work. It's so bad, that it's almost painful to listen to. It was meant to be uplifting and hopeful. Not like this. It's a terrible, terrible song.

I have a son who is a Christian, and I need to get him to believe in God.  The song is great! I love the message it has to Jesus and his teachings, but i love the message more! He taught me that I'm not good enough just to live without God. I need to live for his glory, and I hope that I can live for God's glory and not live for my own glory.

They are too long and boring.  They are supposed to be about Jesus,  but they are about abortion and they go for the throat.  I feel sorry for the children who will listen to this.  They won't know what the heck is going on.  They will be listening to a song they are made to think is about Jesus.  It will be about abortion and killing babies.  They will hear about God and Jesus and the people of God.  They will be thinking about their future.  They will be thinking about how they are going to get a good job and get married and have a family.  They will think about all the beautiful things that God has done in their lives.  They will think that they will be happy.  They will think that they are going to be rich and have a nice house and a great family and the family will be beautiful.  They will be thinking that they will be happy.  They won't be thinking about what is going on in their lives.  They won't even know what the heck is going on.  They will not know that abortion is the biggest war ever and that war is leading them to hell.  They will not know that they are killing babies.  They will not know that the children of pro-life and pro-Jesus are dying and they are crying out to their Father in Heaven.  They will not know that God is on their side and God is going to win.  They will not know that God is going to win.  They will not know that the end is nigh and they will not know that abortion is the biggest war ever and they will not know that abortion is the biggest war ever and they are going to be the ones on the front lines.  They will not know that abortion is the biggest war ever and they are going live with all the agony of dying babies.  They will not know that abortion is the biggest war ever.

I have a CD player at home but I can't seem to download the album, so I have to listen to the songs that I got from this album via CD. I am blown away by this masterpiece. I will put the song on my mp3 player and listen to it constantly. I have been listening to this album non-stop for hours now and I am overwhelmed. I am very impressed with this composer. I am very impressed with this artist and that artist. I cannot believe how this album is such a beautiful, emotional piece of art that speaks to all of us. And, I am very impressed with the fact that this artist has the ability to write music that has such an emotional depth to it. I love this album.

Amazon review: This CD is a wonderful album and I have purchased it twice already to listen to it. One of the best music CDs I have ever bought and I have bought other CDs of this artist before and they were not as good as this. This artist is a master of his art. The music on this CD is great as well as the artwork. I wish this artist more success.

Amazon review: This is a really good song, but it doesn't belong on an album. The song has a really good melody and if it wasn't for the fact that it is in the wrong key, you'd say that this song is very good. If you are a fan of a certain band and you listen to this song with that band, then you'd understand why it is not a good song. But, the fact of the matter is that this song isn't really a "rock" song. It's a "soft" song. It has a really good melody and if it wasn't for the fact that this is in the wrong key, you'd say that this song is very, very good. If you are a fan of a certain band and you play this song with that band, then you'd understand why it is not good. But, the fact of the matter is that this song isn't much of a "rock" song.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a song that I listen to while going about my business or getting ready for a date.  I love the beat and the song.  I am not a big fan of "Love and Hip Hop" type songs.  This is just not a "love and hip hop" type song.

Amazon review: I wish I would have listened to this album before purchasing titles.  This sounds like it is a very nice pop song.  It is easy to listen to and I like the way the lyrics are written.  I will play this song in the shower, at night, when I am sitting around my kitchen table.  I would like it to go on the album because the album has been out for only a short period of time.  I think it is a nice song and I will listen to it often.

Amazon review: When I first heard this song the first time I couldn't believe it!  I really like it, but I don't like that it is a song about someone who just did something bad.  I don't like lyrics like, "If I was just doing my job.  I would have done it, right?"  It's not like this person did something bad, but he "just" did it.  I think it's a great song.  I just wish not all the lyrics were about the bad guy.

Amazon review: I think this song would be a great choice for a movie or a TV show.  I think the lyrics are very nice, it's just that the song is so very negative.

I just wish the lyrics were happier.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A lot of the song is repetitive, but it is nice to hear Meghan trainor sing this song.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I love this cd, and I love that it is original. Sometimes the sax sounds like a dog barking and the guitar is too loud. But the sax and the guitar are great. And the best part of this cd is that it is all original. I don't like some of the songs on this cd. But I like that they're all original.
This is one of the best classical jazz albums.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I don't know who this was. I don't  think I've heard a band this bad.  In fact, I don't think there has ever been a band as bad.  There are so many bad bands who go out and try to be the next big thing, and they're all over. This band were the opposite.  They made it to the top, and they got dumped by the big dogs.  They could have had a hit but they didn't.  They should have sold millions.

Amazon review: For only $30, you can get an 80 minute cd that is worth the money.  I don't know exactly why this is a classic, but I do know that it is one of the best jazz vocal albums of all time.  It's not as if someone just threw all this stuff up and called it a band.  This is a band that has great musicians, and the musicians have fun with the music.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe this band didn't get signed.  They had a hit, a great jazz vocal album, and an album that is as good as anything out there.  I bought this disc on a whim, I had never heard of the band.  I had heard of the music, I thought the singer was a great talent.  I was very wrong.  I was surprised by the band.  They are a great band, and I am glad I bought this disc.  They're not mainstream, but they should be.

Amazon review: I love the music, but I find it to be over produced.  I was also disappointed because I thought the album would be better than the cd due to the quality of the cd.

Amazon review: I bought a cd (and a cd-r) of this album thinking it was going to be a great CD, but what I got was a bad cd.  It was bad in every way except for the music.  Great songs and great voice, but a mediocre recording.  There's a lot of filler in the cd, and the cd is filled with other stuff.  I had to go to the internet to find what the real cd sounded like.  Still, it's a nice cd, but it's not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This cd is definitely not a classic.  I've listened to this cd and it sounds like it was recorded in the 80's.

Amazon review: I bought this cd when it came out.  It was my first introduction to L.M.M.  I like the music, but I don't think this cd will be my last with the band.  I bought the cd with the intent of having it forever, but the cd was so bad that I decided to put it back.  I still love this cd.  The vocals are great, the music is nice, and the lyrics are great.  I hope this cd is released on cd-r so it's not on vinyl.  I was really disappointed that I bought this cd.  The cd is so bad that I can't believe it was released.

Amazon review: I really like the music, but the production is awful.  The vocals are ok, but I don't think there is any talent there.  The musicianship is great, but the production is terrible.

It's just a bad cd.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
