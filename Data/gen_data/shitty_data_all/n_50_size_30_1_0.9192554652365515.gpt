Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: In the late '60s, the Beatles were in their prime and the Beatles were everywhere.  The Beatles were the top selling band of the 1960s.  The Beatles were in a band with John, Paul and George (the other guys in the Beatles).  The Beatles were a band that got very little airplay.  They were also the first band to receive a gold record.  The Beatles had a song called "Twist and Shout" which is very popular.  The Beatles were just a great band.  This album is just a great album.  All the songs are great.  There is nothing wrong with the album.  Just an opinion. I think it is a great album.

Amazon review: If you like the song "When I Fall in Love," you do not have to do the whole thing.  I have done the whole thing.  It's just that I don't like the song.  I don't know if you can tell, but I like to listen to the whole song and then I just skip.  I like to listen to the song as it is and then I skip to the next song.  I want to listen to the songs as they are.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song, I was a little skeptical, but now I like it.  When I Fall in Love is on this album, it is really good.  The song "When I Fall in Love" by the Beatles is really good.  The song "I'm a Loser" is just great.  I never really liked this song, but I like it more now.  I really like the song "I Think I Love You."  The song "I Think I Love You" by the Beatles is really good.

Amazon review: I love the cover of this album and the album is great. The only thing that was missing from this album is that the songs sound a little too much like other songs. For example, in the song "I Need You" i think it should be more like the song "I Need You" by The Police or the song "I Need You" by The Police. The other thing is, the song "Wherever You Go" is very repetitive. Also, the song "The Price Is Right" has some repetitions in the middle of the song. The other thing is, in the song "The Price Is Right" the guitar solos for the first few measures sound like guitars. Also, the song "The Price Is Right" sounds like it is repeating the same few measures over and over. I think the other problem is that it is hard to tell the song is over without knowing who is singing it. The rest of the songs on the album are really good and have a very positive energy.

I would say yes. A man and woman need a sense of belonging. The only way to have that is through a relationship. So, why did I come here? I wanted to get away from the world, from the people who are in love with each other. I wanted to get away to dream. I wanted to dream about love. I wanted the world to be a better place for me to live in and for me to grow up in. So, i purchased this album because it was the best deal i could find. I am just a simple man. I am not a saint.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for some time now. I'm not saying it's not good, but it's just not as good as it could be. The album is very basic and generic. There are no real surprises and there are no real strong moments. I like the way that the album starts out, all acoustic, the first song, "You're the One" is really good. The whole album has that feeling of a good start, and then a little bit of something missing. I wish they would have picked a different song to open the album. The album has no real substance. The songs are all very basic, with a lot of repetition. I'm not a fan of the "Guitar Man" song. I like the other songs very much, but I wish they had picked something that was more original. I'm not sure why this album has the same title as the album "Guitar Man: The Legend in Song." I wish this album had a different name.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor - No Plan is a good album, but if you are looking for the kind of song where the singer is singing to herself, you will be disappointed.  You know those kind of songs where the singer is singing about the guy she just left or how she is so in love with a guy, but she is just thinking of him and how she will always think of him, and her heart just melts?  That kind of song is just not for me.  The songs are just sung by Trainor, and they are just her and her voice. There aren't any lyrics, I just feel it is not the same.  I'm not going to lie, I'm a big fan of Trainor, and I am really hoping for this album to be better.  I'll still put up with her singing to herself just for the heck of it, but if it's not going to be something I want to listen to, then I won't.  I also don't think I will be as interested to listen to the songs that have been released for "No Plan." I'll probably just stay away. No big deal. I just want to be able to pick out what songs I really want to listen to and not get into the "I just can't listen to this song" attitude.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Meghan trainor is one of those artists I'll listen to just for a couple days and then think "I'm not going to listen to this artist again."  I don't have the patience to listen to her songs for more than that, but I do like music, and I can't stand to wait for the next album to come out.  I just want to hear the whole album, not just a few songs.  She is talented and has a voice that is so unique.  I hope she can figure out a way to make new songs better and better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Meghan trainor since her debut in 2004. I thought she was a great talent and I'm glad to see she's getting more recognition outside of her mainstream country success. Unfortunately the tracks I do want to listen to are just not good enough to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the songs that I have been hearing on this CD.  It's just a shame that the songs on the CD are not what I was hoping for.  Meghan Trainor has a voice that is really unique, and her songs have just been nothing more then just her voice and her lyrics. If you are expecting something more than that then you will be sorely disappointed.  It's still good to listen to if you like the music, but I honestly am not going to listen to it ever!  I do love her other albums though.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There are some good songs on this CD.  One of my favorites is "I Don't Know About You," but some of the other songs just don't work for me.  I can't listen to them, I can't remember the words to them, and I find it hard to remember the songs.  I can't help but compare this with her other albums.  It's like comparing apples and oranges.  I'm pretty sure there are some songs on this CD that were on her other albums.  I will listen to her other albums though.  I just hate to listen to this album on CD and I hate to listen to it on my iPhone.  I'm not a fan of the app and I think it's a waste of money to buy this CD on iTunes.  I'm sure it will be worth it, but I just don't see the point of getting the CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like Meghan Trainor's music.  I don't know why I don't like it.  I can't think of any songs that I hate, so it's hard to hate something that isn't there. I don't know, maybe it's not her voice I don't like, maybe it's the music?  Maybe it's the lyrics?  I don't know.  I just don't get it.  I like the fact that she is an original.  I just wish she would stop thinking up new songs and create a new album.  It's almost like she is a one hit wonder.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the voice and the music.  I really wish she would quit writing new songs and stop trying to make this the next big thing.  It doesn't even last six months and then you have to make the next album, and the next album, and the next album.  I just don't get it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of this band when I was in the early 80's.  If I remember correctly I had a copy of "Slip of the Tongue" on vinyl in the house.  I remember playing it and thinking it was a song worth a listen.  So after I left the house I threw the album out.  Why?  Because it was the worst album I had ever heard.  If you liked anything from the 80's that is.  Go listen to "Slip of the Tongue" again.  I don't know if you will like it or not.  It's probably a good idea.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've always liked this band.  They have a very interesting sound to them.  They were one of the first bands to release a studio album with a full band, and I've always really liked that.  I remember thinking this was a good album when I first heard it.  Maybe even a little better than most.

Amazon review: I always liked the band and thought they were great.  "No More Tears" was a good, solid, and well produced album.  I thought their music was a great representation of their music.

Amazon review: I was a long time fan of this band.  They were one of the first post-Stones bands I was a fan of because I thought they were one of the first bands to actually have good songs.

I still think they are one of the best bands of the 2000's.

Amazon review: This album is one of my favorite albums.  I can't believe that this is over 30 years old!  Now that they have released an album full of really good music I think they should be proud of this album.  If you like rock and roll and love this band you need to have this album.

Most of the songs are good but the last one "Stark Naked" was very poor, at least to me.  I really liked "Sister Mary" and "Stark Naked" were average songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I love the CD, I love the cover art, I love the message.  I just can't listen to this CD any more.  I can't stand the song "I Wish It Was You Today" and I think "I Wish" is a song that should never have been on this CD.  I also don't like the song "I Wish" and don't relate to it. I can't understand what was going on with the song "I Wish".  I don't even know what to say about the song "A Thousand Miles" because it's just not a song I would listen to.  The CD cover artwork is gorgeous, the CD is great, but I don't think I will ever listen to this CD again.

Amazon review: So I bought this album on a whim. I was looking for something new, something with a different style. I am a huge fan of the band, so I figured, why not give the album a shot? I listened to the songs on the album and I think it's a good album. The songs on the album are upbeat and fun. The song "Don't Ask Me Why" is my favorite on the album and I love the song "Livin' on a Prayer".  I was hoping the album would be better than just the songs on the CD, but it seems to be average at best. The songs on the album are good and there are a few songs that are really good.  I bought the album because I thought it would be fun to pick a song or two and listen to them again and again. After I listen to the songs on the album a couple of times and then discard them, I will probably buy the CD. I just don't think I will listen to the CD for a long time.

I did not know this man. I didn't know his music. I didn't know what he did. I didn't even recognize him. I didn't know he had a talent. But I could tell you exactly why he is my favorite artist. Because he is an inspiration to me. A person I respect and admire. Not only has he inspired me, but he has shown me how to be a better person in the way he lives his life.

There is a reason why he is my favorite artist.

I didn't know exactly why he was my favorite. But I knew he was a great artist. He did not just create music, he created people. He created me.

What he did was give me an eternal view of beauty in life. He gave me a reason to live. He gave me a love that never dies. He gave me an appreciation for every second of life. He gave me a passion for life that I will never forget.

He was my motivation. I did not know why. I only knew I had to have him in my life. I had to be inspired by him. I had to have him in my mind so when I was walking down the street, I was looking at life and not knowing what to do with it. I had to look at life and be in awe of it. I had to see life and have the desire to change it.

I didn't know what to do with life. I didn't know what to do with people. I didn't know how to be a person. I didn't know how to love. But I knew this was my motivation. This was the reason I wanted him in my life. I wanted to be inspired by him so when life happened, I could be inspired. I wanted to love.

He started my passion to become more beautiful and to become more beautiful. He gave me the inspiration to love and to be loved.

I couldn't do it without him. I couldn't do it without his life's inspiration. It's so simple. When I look at him, I know that he is my inspiration.

I knew he had a great voice. When I heard his voice, I knew I loved to hear him sing. I knew he was an incredible artist. But I didn't know it was his voice that made me love him.

I didn't know why. I didn't know why I loved him. But I knew it was because of his voice and because he made me feel like I was looking at the world and everything around me was amazing.

Because of his words and his songs, I started to feel like there was something more to life. I started to feel like I could be more. I started to feel like I could be a better person.

I didn't know why. But I knew it was because he was my inspiration. He was my motivation. I needed him. I needed his life to keep me going. He was my inspiration. He was my motivation. I needed him.

I didn't know why. But I knew it was me and him. We were us. I needed him in my life. I needed him to be a part of my life. He was my motivation. He inspired me. He motivated me. He was my inspiration. He was my motivation. I needed him in my life. I needed him to be a reason to live.

I didn't know why. But I knew it was him. I needed him in my life. He was my motivation. He was my inspiration. He was my motivation. I needed him to be a reason to live. I needed him in my life.

I didn't know why. But I knew it was us. We were us. I needed him in my life. I needed his life to keep me going. I needed him to be a part of my life. He was our motivation. He was our inspiration. He was our motivation. I needed him in my life. I needed him to be our inspiration.

I didn't even know it was his music. I just needed my inspiration.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I listened to the entire album, and I really enjoyed it. I have never seen the band live, but I have been fortunate enough to see them on stage in the past.

Amazon review: When I was a kid, my mom used to listen to "You're the One That I Want to Marry", and I would sing along with the lyrics and I would sing it so loud that the whole neighborhood would hear me, and I would get a few looks because I was singing "I'm a Believer" and "I'm a Woman".

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This album was great! I loved the first two albums, but I was a bit disappointed with this one. I think it is a nice step up from the first two albums.

I have the CD in the CD player, and the album is still on the same CD. No big deal because it's still there, just with a different name.

Amazon review: This album gives you the feeling of walking into an old time carnival with a carnival barker and a carnival band. The music is absolutely fantastic, and the lyrics are equally as good. The band is all male, they dress like old time carnival bands, and they play some of the best 70's music ever, even better than some of the bands in our area. The vocals are amazing, and the music is fantastic.

Amazon review: I grew up on a steady diet of country music, and I loved it. I started listening to some of the oldies when I was in the 8th grade, and the songs that I loved the most were "Blue Moon" and "In the Jailhouse Now" by Elvis Presley.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:  I have been going back and forth on this cd, so listen carefully to the first two songs, "It's a Lovely Day" and "The Last Thing I Remember".  I would still recommend this cd, but not for those who are not musical.  I am a classical music fan, and as such, I prefer the classical music.    The music here is very similar to the music in the movie "The Phantom of the Opera".  The music in this cd is not the  same style, but it is definitely related.

Amazon review:  I have heard this CD several times but to be honest, I don't know what to make of them.  I think they are a really good band and I am glad to hear they had this cd out.

I would have to say that the music on this CD is superior to the second cd.    I think as long as you have a good selection of CDs, you will be able to find some great music wherever you are.

Amazon review: This is Eminem's first album since his death in 2005, and he has a pretty good album here. The only problem is that the song selection is a little hit or miss. For instance, there is nothing that he has done before. There are no songs that he has written on this album, so it's like he's just recording a collection of songs he's heard in the past or his own compositions. But it's not a bad album. For the most part, it's great!
