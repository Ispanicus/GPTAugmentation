Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

About Me

I am a native of Kentucky but have spent the better part of the past ten years living in Texas. The music and travel have kept me busy. I have been a professional musician for over 30 years, but have also been a professional photographer for over 20 of those years. I have worked professionally as a photographer since 1986. I am an avid reader of many genres of music, and love to write about it. Thank you for visiting my blog.

"Music is a force for good, it can lift spirits, it can bring people together, and if you listen to music, you have nothing to fear." - Dr. John Gourley

"Music is a great equalizer. It can bring people together, as a band, as a family, as a church, or a community. It can bring you together with yourself. It can make you laugh, cry, or think. It can create a whole new world. It can make people feel better, or make them feel worse, but that's the beauty of music." - Dr. John Gourley

"Music has the ability to make people feel better. It can make someone sadder, but it can also bring someone to their feet. Music is a great equalizer. It can make people feel better, or make them feel worse, or make them feel their best. It can bring people together, or it can break them down. It can make people laugh or cry, or it can make them sing for a long time. It can change the way you think, or the way you feel, or the way you look at life. Music can do anything. Music can heal, it can make you laugh, it can make you cry, it can make you feel sad, it can make you happy. Music can make you smile, or it can make you smile at the strangest moments of your life. Music can make you want to dance, or it can make you want to sit." - Dr. John Gourley

"Music can make you smile, or it can make you cry, it can make you laugh, it can make you think, it can make you dance. Music can make you feel good, or it can make you feel terrible. Music can make you want to run, or it can make you want to stay. Music can make you want to talk, or it can make you want to listen. Music can make you want to sing, or it can make you want to sing. Music can make you want to dance, or it can make you not want to dance. Music can make you want to run, or it can make you not want to run. Music can make you talk, or it can make you want to listen. Music can make life beautiful, or it can make life ugly. Music can bring you to tears, or it can make you laugh. Music

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I am very disappointed with this CD.  It is not as bad as it seems.  The cover has a lot of good things going for it.  The music is really good,  The songs are well arranged,  the recording is good,  the backing vocals are good,  and the saxophone player is in fact very good.  I'm sure he can play and he's a good singer.  But I'm not going to get behind this CD.  I'm not going to be a fan of the artists on this CD.  I'm not even going to give it a five star rating.  It is really just one of their more boring albums to me.

Amazon review: I received my copy of this CD a few days ago and it was a total disappointment.  From the very beginning I am not a fan of this band.  The CD is very repetitive with 3 minutes of music and 2 songs.  I am not sure how this band continues.  I will continue to buy and listen to their CD's but not any new ones.  I do love the band's cover of the song "I've Got A Home In Heaven (The Lord Is My Shepherd)."  These guys are a bit different from other bands on the market.  They are a real Christian band and they are good.  But they're not very good.  The songs are poorly arranged and I can't tell who sings what.  The album ends with the song "I Can't Keep My Faith" and just doesn't cut it.

Amazon review: Just a little. I found the "new" J. Jewel album to be a bit of a disappointment. I've loved her since the 80's, but I thought she had grown up and moved on with her life. This album does not reflect that. I really, really, really wish I could have heard more songs from the new album. Unfortunately, this album was a bit of a let down for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am sorry to say that I am not a fan of J. Jewel. The songs are great, and you can tell that she puts a lot of effort into them. The problem is, I think that it would be nice to hear them as a whole, and not just as a compilation. I love the music in which she sings, and I am glad that she sings it, but where is the music that she recorded in the studio? I find the songs to be very "loud" and with little substance to them. It doesn't really matter if the songs are good, but I feel that I should feel like I am hearing a whole album instead of just a compilation of songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am so sorry to say this but I have never heard this album. It was a disappointment on many levels. The music is great, but I think more could have been accomplished on this album. There is no "new" J. Jewel, she is in her early 60's. The music is all her own, and the lyrics are good, but the "new" J. Jewel just did not live up to the expectations that I had of her, and this was only her third album. I would rate this album a 2 star.

Amazon review: I really liked the Jewel album. I was very surprised at how well she sang at this age. I thought she was going to be a very poor singer by the end of her career.

She was able to sing in a way that I thought she could not and showed that she had grown up musically. I am glad that she has chosen to sing again. I hope she is ready to tour again soon.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: The original is more pop-friendly, but what's really impressive is how the whole album is just packed full of great songs. It's a good mix of traditional and alternative rock. There are also several strong, modern songs. If you are a fan of this band, then this is the CD you need.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: An absolute must have for anyone in the music industry. I've been a fan for years and I've seen them grow from playing in coffee houses to opening for the likes of Bob Dylan and The Beach Boys. I've seen them get signed to major labels and have seen them become huge stars.

Amazon review: The album "Let The Records Play" is a great introduction to The Pines and the rest of their impressive catalog. It's a great listen. The first CD is a much more polished product with a good balance of hard rock and alternative rock, but this CD is the one that will stick with you. The band is always worth checking out and this CD is a must have. In addition to the CD, there is a live video from the band at the end of the album that is worth checking out.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've always been a fan of the jazz, blues and folk.  I used to work at a record shop and always checked out the jazz and folk CDs in the shop's CD section.  I discovered the band of the same name when I was browsing in a used  music store and saw a CD of 10 songs for like $20.  I thought it was a good buy and bought it.  I've never been able to find a good jazz, blues or folk CD.  So I'm in heaven.  The band's three members are outstanding and their music is very easy to listen to.  They play a diverse repertoire including standards, spirituals, folk tunes, originals, and original compositions.  The band has a good, friendly vibe to it, and are able to play with a band (or four) and have a great time doing it.  The band's one member is a very skilled guitarist who plays very well.  He plays on every song, and is very good.  The drummer is also very good although he is not as good as the guitarist.  So the band is made up of a very well-rounded and talented individual.  The sax player is probably the best jazz and folk musician I've heard to date.  He is able to play with a band (or four) and has a great time doing it.  The band's sound is very good.  The recording is well-done with clear, crisp sound.  The band performs in a small bar with four walls and a stage.  The band is very friendly and is easy to talk to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The band was really young, and just started to develop.  Their music was very difficult to play.  The sax player was very talented, but the band members were not there yet.  They had a really good sound, but it was very difficult to play.  The band was not very professional.  They did not have a good recording of their music.  I would not recommend this band.  They are in a different style from most other bands.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

This is excellent classical music that I have enjoyed for years. I am looking forward to buying more from this singer.

I am a musician, and my wife is a musician. I often have the music that I listen to while I write, or rehearse, or just when i am alone. When I first started listening to classical music, I was very skeptical of the quality of the music, but I soon began to appreciate it. I have always loved the music because of the beauty of the melodies and the harmony. The music is very challenging in that it demands the utmost of musicians. The music is so complex and beautiful that it is easy to be lost in the beauty of the piece. I can hear the beauty of the music in my mind and it is one thing that I do not want to lose. In addition to enjoying the music, I have been able to share it with others. By listening to a piece of music, my wife can hear the beauty and the challenges of the music and she can share the music with me. I have been able to share the music with my friends and family, and they have begun to appreciate the beauty of the music. The music has given me a joy that I have never experienced before. I am most grateful.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!

Amazon review: I have listened to this album twice and I am not satisfied.  I am so disappointed.  I would recommend this album to those who like hip hop, but I would not recommend this album to those who like rock music.  I would not recommend this album to those who like pop music, this album is not for you.  I did not like the last album, so I was expecting this one to be great.  So I guess it was not.  I also did not like the last album, so I was expecting this one to have at least 10 tracks. It had only 9 tracks.  There were no songs that I liked, so I just wanted to get this album, but I am disappointed.  I don't know if this is the work of a good band, a bad band, or just a bad album.  There are some good songs on this album, so I just wouldn't recommend this album to those who listen to rock music.  I would recommend this album to those who listen to pop music, this album is not for you.  I would recommend this album to those who listen to hip hop music, this album is not for you.  I would not recommend this album to those who listen to rock music, this album is not for you.  I would not recommend anything to anyone, but I did like this album.

Amazon review: This album isn't Schubert. It is a Schubert CD made by Schubert himself. This album was recorded between 1875 and 1886. There is no reason that it couldn't be a classic. It is a nice album filled with Schubert's love for his fatherland and his family.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Very disappointing.  I bought this on a whim, and I was not expecting much.  It is a very short list, all 5 songs are really good, but it was not what I was expecting.  The first two songs they are just generic rap songs.  Really disappointing.  I will give them another chance if I am ever given the chance to buy them again.  I will not buy them again.

Amazon review: I love this album. I love the rap and I love the hip-hop.  I listen to this album on repeat.  I like the tracks and I like the beat, it’s really good.  I don’t like them all, I like the ones I like the best.  I’ve listened to this album hundreds of times.  It’s truly one of my favorite rap albums.  I’ve been a huge fan of this album since I first heard it in 2004.  I like the album so much I almost bought the 2nd album, but I decided against it because the first one was just so much better.  The main reason I bought this album was because it was on the radio.  I love how it has always been on the radio.  I think it says something that I have bought this album for $10 on iTunes.  I don’t think it would cost that much on CD.  I like the album so much I almost bought the 2nd one, but I decided against it because the first one was just so much more better.  The main reason I bought this album was because it was in my favorite radio station.  I listened to it on my drive to work.  I love how it has always been on the radio.  As soon as I got home I put it on the stereo so I could listen to it when I was doing chores or doing anything.  I think it says something that I have bought this album for the radio.  I love this album so much I almost bought the 2nd album, but I decided not to because the first one was so much better.  The main reason I bought this album was because I didn’t have the money.  I could have bought the 2nd album and I could have put it on my iPod.  I think it says something that I’ve bought this album for the radio.  I listen to this album on repeat.  I would give it an 8/10 if I had not been given this album for free and I don’t really care about it since I didn’t buy it.  I would give it a 5/10 if I had not been given this album for free and I really don’t care about it.  I would give it a 4/10 if I had not been given this album for free and I wouldn’t really care about it since I didn’t buy anything on this album.

Amazon review: This is a nice addition to the Schubert album on iTunes.  It is not particularly noteworthy.  It is not something you will be listening to on repeat for years.  It is just that good.

Amazon review: I had not heard it before and was only going to buy it because of the reviews and because I was curious.  I listened to it on a whim and I decided to buy it.  The first thing you should know about this album is the cover.  It is the most obnoxious cover I have ever seen.  It is a huge red and white design with a picture of a naked guy on the cover.  I have seen worse yet I have seen worse, but this is the absolute worst.  It is very jarring and makes it hard to listen to.  The second thing you need to know about this album is the songs.  I have heard that these lyrics are completely unoriginal.  I have not heard that they are bad but I have heard that they are boring.  I like these songs a lot and it is the first time I have heard them.  I was very excited to get this album.  I listen

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I wish the original album came out in the same way. As a matter of fact, I like this better than the original (although that's not saying much). The first half of this album, especially the title track, has some of the best driving rockin' rockin' blues I have ever heard. The rest of the album is much less interesting, and the songs that are interesting (like "The Spy Hunter") have a lot of filler in them. Still, it's enjoyable.
