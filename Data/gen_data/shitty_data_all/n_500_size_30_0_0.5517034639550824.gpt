Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: She's a young, beautiful, and sexy singer with a cool voice.  It's a shame she's so bland and boring.  I mean, she's not boring.  The songs she's written are fun, interesting, and pretty.  I wouldn't call them boring, but they're not very interesting either.  The lyrics are pretty average either.  She's a cool voice but her guitar playing is bad, and her bass playing is just plain bad.  I actually like her.  I think she's going to be a big star.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: She's not great, she's not bad, but she's not good either.  She sings in a pretty, simple, and low pitch way.  She's got a good voice and a nice, but not great, guitar.  It kind of sounds like she's using the guitar to take a voice part.  I mean, I guess she could be using the guitar to take a part, but she's not.  It's not very interesting, and it's not very well done.  I don't understand how she has more than 200 songs on this cd.  I'm really glad she's getting a lot of exposure, but you'd figure she'd be way better than this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know what to think of this CD.  It's very boring and not very good.  It's probably going to sound like crap.  It's not even a good CD.  I could tell by the cover that it was supposed to be a collection of her best songs, but it sounds like there's a bunch of filler and not a lot of good songs here.  It's not a bad CD, it's just not very good.  It's got a few songs, but it's really boring, and the music is too repetitive and boring.  This is not a good album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is a collection of songs by a young woman from Japan.  I like the way some of the songs are arranged.  She has a decent voice, and her guitar playing is pretty good.  The only reason I didn't give this one a higher rating is because I prefer the first 3 albums of hers I've heard and I'm not really bothered by some of the filler songs.  I'd like to give this one a higher rating.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this is a really good album.  The songs are good and the musicians are good.  The arrangements are good.  I don't know why they're putting out so many different albums of her.  It's really just like everyone else's albums.  All of the albums are good, but this is by far the best.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I like the way this album starts, and the way it finishes.  I don't know what happened to the ballads and the love songs.  Her voice is great, and she has a nice guitar.  She's an awesome artist.  I think the songs are good and the musicians are good.  I guess they just don't know how to stop putting out more albums.  I think it's annoying, and I think it's a waste of time.

Amazon review:  I really like the songs on this album.  They're all good.  I think they're all good.  I like the way they're arranged.  I like the way she sings.  She's a cool singer.  I don't think I like the last song.  It's just too much of the same kind of music.  I also don't like the way it starts.  It's just a lot of filler.  I also don't like some of the songs on the albums.  I don't know why they put out so many albums.  It's really annoying.  I'd like to hear some new stuff.  Then again, I don't really care.  I just like listening to her albums.

Amazon review:  This CD is really good.  It's not a new album.  It sounds like she's continuing her work.  I like the way she's singing.  I like her guitar playing.  I like her voice.  She is a really good singer.  I don't know why she's putting out a new album every year.  It's really annoying and annoying.  I think she's too much of a good looking chick.  I think she should stop putting out new albums.  I think she should just make a new cd every year.  She should stop putting out new albums.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: This is a great song!  It's a shame I can't find a copy of this song anywhere.  If I could find it I would buy it!  This is one of the better songs on the CD, but it was a little too "sad" for my liking.  I'll probably buy this CD.  Thank you!

Amazon review: I didn't own this music CD, but when I saw it on the shelf at a record store my heart fell.  I purchased this CD thinking it may be a good song for me to purchase as I am a fan of the Dave Clark Five.  It is good but not "perfect" for me.  I loved the original version, but I wish they had written a better lyric.  I'll purchase a Dave Clark Five CD to listen to these songs on.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Dave Clark Five for several years now.  The original Dave Clark Five album, "Songs in the Key of Five", has long been my favorite.  When I saw the CD in the store I was not disappointed.  The songs are great and the musicianship impressive.  It was a very pleasant surprise to find that the CD contained the original version of "Songs in the Key of Five."  When I first purchased the CD I was not satisfied but I was happy that it was available.  I received an email from the Dave Clark Five inviting me to purchase the CD.  I eagerly accepted their offer and have been happy with the product since.  I am glad I listened to the CD and not just the CD cover.  I am looking forward to purchasing additional tracks from this CD.

Amazon review: I bought this CD.  I had to listen to the CD several times before I could really figure out what I liked.  I was interested in the song "Hurry Home" but I was disappointed that it did not have the same lyrics as the original.  I still like that song enough to purchase the CD.  I listened to the CD and was surprised at how well the guitar part was played.  I was surprised at how good the vocals were.  I liked the Dave Clark Five.  I have been a fan of the Dave Clark Five for a long time and I have never heard a song or album that is as good as the songs on this CD.  I have heard one CD from the Dave Clark Five recently and I will purchase the other songs on that CD.  I hope you continue to make good albums.  I am happy with the music you have made.  I will purchase other Dave Clark Five CDs.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: It is not the same song, it is a different song. The song is called 'My Name is Jonas' by the Jonas Brothers.  The song is about a man who had to leave home to pursue his dream. He had to leave his family and friends behind, he had to work on his dream and never look back. He felt he was alone. He left his wife and had to marry another woman. He was lonely. He was so lonely. Then one day he was offered a job in London. It was a great opportunity for him to take a long vacation away from the pressures of his home town and the loneliness that he was experiencing. He bought a ticket and left. He never looked back.  He never looked back. He never looked back.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I was looking for a spiritual journey that was good for kids.  Turns out I don't have any kids.  I don't even have a dog.  I'm just here for the music.  This is a great album.  And it's not even a good album by Prince.  You can tell by the way Prince records. He's not going to have a good time with the band either.  It's just another one of those commercial albums.  I'm sure he's got some new songs.   It'd be better if he made the whole thing a "solo" album, which he is also rumored to be working on.  The new songs are going in the "Solo" album.  I don't know why Prince is even doing this.  He can't write his own songs.  He can't write a song that's good without the band in the studio.  He's like a magician.  He makes everything look like magic.  He just makes it appear.  But then you realize there's magic there.  And you're not there.     You just have to be there to get it.    When the band's on it's magic.  When the band's off it's just another album of Prince.                I've been on a quest to find a good Prince album.  It's been a long time.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: I heard this song and thought it was pretty, until I heard the words that said "I'm a very good dancer."  I don't know why they put that on the cd, because I heard the song, and it is just a little annoying.  I don't know why the cd was called "Waltz With Me", maybe the whole album is called "Waltz With Me".  I think I will try to find the album and put the cd on, but don't tell my wife.

Amazon review: This song was very boring, when I first heard it.  I don't know why the singer sang this, because I could not understand a word she said.  The song is called "Riding In A Black Car".

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: After seeing the album cover, I was expecting music that sounded a lot like the songs from "The Promise" (which was a very good album) with a lot of acoustic guitar and piano.  I was a little disappointed, but not completely disappointed.  I thought the songs were very good, but I thought the album was lacking in some areas.  I think the songs are good, but I don't think they are stellar.  I'd recommend this to fans of older albums, but not to new listeners.

Amazon review: Jewel did two albums that I think are incredible.  The first album is "The Promise" and the second album is "The Gospel".  The songs that I chose to put on this album are the songs that I think are the best songs of both albums.  Every song on "The Gospel" is better than on "The Promise".  This album is just as great as the first album.  I don't think there is any other album that compares to this one.  The songs on this one are just as good as on the first album.  I don't think there is anything else that compares to this album.  I love everything about this album.  I love the album cover and I love the songs.  I love the music.  I love the songs.

Amazon review: I would like to begin by saying that I am a huge fan of the music of Thelonius Monk.  This is my second encounter with his work.  The first being a recording of Monk playing piano and singing the song "Love and Marriage" that can be found on the first volume of a book entitled "Songs of the Century Volume 2"  I have to say that I was very impressed with the way the pianist played the song.  He had a pretty good technique for this song that is the basis for many of his piano solos. I was also impressed with the way Monk sang it.  I am a fan of Monk's work and I am very happy that I came across this recording.

Amazon review: A man with a microphone can do many things.  This artist takes it a step further and uses it to create some beautiful sounds for his music.  His use of this unique piece to create some beautiful sounds is excellent.  The recording quality is very high and the sound is top notch.  From the opening notes of the song to the final notes, this is a very good recording.  There are a few times during the song where it sounds like the sound is getting garbled, but the sound is always there and I can hear it all the way through the song.  This is a very good recording by a very good artist.

This is what I have found on the web:
Amazon.com has a lot of music by the same artist: Tom Scott.  It is a very good jazz album.  I have been asked if you would like to see a list of all of the Tom Scott Jazz CDs.  I will send you a list in about an hour.
Now:  I have a list of all the Tom Scott jazz CDs and I have not heard one of them, BUT, I have heard several.  I am very excited about this list.  I believe that you will find a lot of good jazz music on this list.  I have listed only what I am sure you will enjoy very much and what I am sure you will not like very much.

Amazon.com has a lot of music by the same artist: Frank Wess.  It is a very good jazz album.  I have been requested if you would like to see a list of all of the Frank Wess Jazz CDs.  I will send you a list in about an hour, because I have been asked by numerous people if you would like to see a list of all

The album came in a large jewel case, it was very heavy and it took two hours to put it on my lap. It's in a blue, blue, blue, and white color. I'm very happy with this album. The last few days I got a lot of music that I have been dying to listen to. I think this is one of the best albums that I have ever had the chance to listen to. It has a lot of different genres and styles of music. I would rate this album a 10/10.

I bought this album 2 weeks ago after hearing about it on some radio station. I like this album very much. It has a lot of great songs so it makes it a great album to have. I'm glad I bought it, as every song on this album is great. I'm glad I bought this album. It's a must have for all trance lovers.

This album is not like most other trance albums, it's more original and more interesting, because it has a lot of different styles of music. It is very easy to dance to, and every song is easily accessible and fun to listen to. I'm glad I bought this album.

This is the best album of 2009 for me. It has a lot of amazing songs. I really like the song "Gotta Get Out of This Place", the song "Tired of Waiting for Me" and two other songs named "I Just Want To Be Normal" and "I Want To". It's a great album and definitely worth buying.

This is a great album, some of the songs are really good, some of them are really bad. It's a mix of different types of electronic music, with some more traditional electronica, some trance and some more pop-electro. It's very good. I like it. I would recommend everyone to buy this album. I would recommend everyone to buy it. Buy this album.

I have been listening to this album for about a week now and I love it! It is very different from anything else that I have heard in the last year.

This is a great album. I love all the songs on it. It sounds like a lot of different genres all together. I would recommend everyone to get this album. Buy it!

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't like her voice at all.  She makes it sound like she's on drugs, and she's not.  The arrangements are good with a few good tunes.  I don't understand why she wants to take so many liberties with the original songs and write her own melodies to go along with them.  If you like the '80s and '90s you'll probably like this.  Don't waste your time on this because she's not singing anything you haven't heard before.

I have a few personal favorites on the CD, but the rest is average.  I don't have a lot of patience to sit and listen to an album for a long time, so I'm not sure what to add.  I'll give it a listen, but I'm sure it'll be just a few hours.

I'm not sure if the songs on this CD are better than the songs on her other CD's.  I'll have to check out her other CD's to see where her talents lie.  I'll also have to check to see if there is a DVD or any other recording of this CD.  Most of her CD's sound good, but not every song sounds good.  This CD sounds good, but I'm not sure if it's worth the money.

I don't know whether these songs are worth listening to, but they sound okay, and I have to say that they are not bad.  I enjoyed listening to them.  I had to stop listening to her after I bought these songs.  I'm not sure why she wanted to write her own songs and try to sell them that way.  I'm not a big Whitney Houston fan, but I could listen to her songs just fine.

It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

It has the sort of music that I like to listen to when I'm in a bad mood or when I'm out with people, or just wanting a fun, uplifting song to listen to. I don't listen to it as much when I am in a good mood, but I will still listen to it. I think that's why I always have it in the house when I am singing as a church group. What can I say, my mind is always in the mood for a good song when I am singing.
