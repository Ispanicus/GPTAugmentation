Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.

The lyrics are just what you would expect from Cher, and the songs are exactly what you would expect from Cher.  I think she's got a great voice, and I think she's got a great ear.  The only thing is that if you listen to the lyrics, you're kind of forced to listen to the words, and there aren't very many lyrics on here.  The songs are very good, but the lyrics aren't very good.  It's a good album, but you have to go into it knowing that you're going to have to know the lyrics.  The songs are great, and the album is great.

The Top-Notch, Outstanding, Top-Earning, and Best-Selling
In the history of the music industry,
you have to be a bit of a genius to consistently
sell more than a million CD's of your music,
and then sell millions more.
If you're a top-ranking genius,
the only way to make more money is to
compete against these "millionaires"
who are selling millions of albums by the hour.
For example,
a musician who had released over two hundred albums
on the Billboard top 200-rock charts
in the year 2000,
would have to sell over 2,500,000 copies
of songs.
That's a huge feat in this music industry,
but it's only one of the things that makes
the Top-Notch the world's best-selling
record label.
These are the companies that are selling
the most records,
and the Top-Notch is the only one that has
an exclusive contract with them.
It's also the only label that is allowed to
sell the entire catalog of its customers,
which is a huge advantage for the label,
as it can sell songs that it doesn't have the rights
for,
or songs that the musicians don't want to release.
On the other hand,
the Top-Notch is also the only company in the United

Amazon review: I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.  I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the show out there.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This is an excellent version of this song.  It's one of my favorites.  I love the original.  The instrumental is great and it has a cool and funky feel.  I don't like the vocals on this version, the way they are layered over the instrumentals.  They are a little too loud in the beginning, then get a little quieter at the end.  In the original song, they are just a little louder in the beginning and then the ending is a little quieter.

Amazon review: I'm a huge Cole Porter fan.  This is a great version of his song, but the background of the song is quite distracting as well as the lyrics to the song.  The original version starts with the lyrics "And the birds all sing a song of love".  The final verse is "And the birds all sing a song of love".  But in this version, they are "And the birds all sing a song of love".  The original starts with "And the birds all sing a song of love".  The final verses is "And the birds all sing a song of love"

Amazon review: I don't like this version, it has too much background music on it.

Amazon review: When I first heard the original version of this song, I thought it was going to be a good song - it is great.  But then when I listened to this version, I wanted to throw it out.  I've read all the comments on Amazon, the ones from people saying "I heard it as a teenager, it was great and then I heard it as an adult and it was a complete waste of time."  I just don't have the patience for that.  The music is great, the lyrics are good, but the vocals are a complete waste of time.  You can't hear the lyrics at all.  The vocalists are okay.  The vocalists are okay.  I don't like the ending of the song.  I didn't like the ending.  It's not right, it's not the right ending for the song.  I think the ending should have been "And the birds all sing a song of love" instead of "And the birds all sing a song of love."  This is another great version of this great song.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: Not a bad set of songs, but nothing special.  I like some of the songs, but they're nothing special.  I like the song "The Longest Way Home" and the song "Loving You" especially, but it's a lot of filler.  The song "Hazel" is very good, but "It's Only Love" doesn't have any special characteristics to it.  It's just a generic love song that has no real meaning.  The best songs are "Hazel" and "It's Only Love", but even they are nothing special.  They're just good songs.  The other songs do have some meaning, but they're just not special enough to make the set memorable.  I hate filler.

Amazon review: This is one of the most well-written songs I've ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this is the first song I've ever heard that is a good, if not great, example of the "singing" style that is very close to what I've been doing for many years.  It's probably one of the best guitar songs I've ever heard.  I really like the way he plays and sings the ballads.  I'm not a big fan of the rock ballads but I do like the singing style.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this song is a little too loud, but I like how it's sung.  I also like the guitar solo.  But I don't think the vocals are that great.  After listening to it a few times, I really don't think I care for the singer.  I think she's trying too hard to be the strong-voiced, "sophisticated" woman she's portraying (which is a good thing) but I just don't care for it.  She's not convincing.  I think she uses too much vibrato and the pitch doesn't seem to "stay" the same.  The whole thing just sounds forced.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like this song.  It's well-written and I like the lyrics.  It's a little country.  I like the sound of the guitar.  The sound is very good.  The song is simple and it's very well-done.  It's a good song to listen to while waiting for my car to heat up.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was amazed at how well-written this song was.  I'm a big fan of ballads and, though it's a ballad, it's not a typical ballad.  The lyrics are very well written.  The piano accompaniment is very good.  This song is also a good song to listen to while waiting for my car to heat up or in between stops on the highway.  It's well-written and it has great music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the sound of the strings in this song.  It sounds like you can hear the different strings and the difference between the two.  I really like the guitar solo.  It's a good song to listen to while waiting for my bus or on the bus.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this album is not for everyone and I'm not sure if it's the best country album ever made, but I do think that it's the best country album I've ever heard.  It's a very good album.  The songs are very well-written.  The lyrics are very well-written.  The music is very well-done.  I also like the guitar solo.  I don't like the rock ballads and I don't like the acoustic ballads.  I think the songs are all good but I don't think they're all really that good.  I like the ballads and I like the acoustic ballads but the songs don't do much for me.  The songs sometimes seem to be written in a different time period than the time we now live in.  The only reason I give the album 4 stars is because it's a very good album.  It's very well-written.  I like the songs and I like the album.  I think it's a very good album.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I was looking for a way to pass the time while waiting for my wife to get her life back together.  In a word, I was looking for a diversion.  I was in a jam, and I needed something to keep me from going crazy.  My wife was having problems in her marriage, and she wanted to come home.  So I put on this album and took a break to let it play.  I've listened to this album a couple of times, and I don't understand why it doesn't work for me.

Amazon review: I got this album in the mail, and I was excited to hear it.  I had had a hard time finding a decent rock album for my wife out there in the mail, so I was excited to see a new release for my collection.

So I guess I'll have to buy the album again, when I see it in the store.

Amazon review: I couldn't believe my ears.  This album is awesome.  I knew I was going to like it, but this album is pure awesomeness.  The album is filled with catchy, rocking music, and some of the best lyrics that I've heard in a while.  My only complaint is that the packaging of the album is a little ugly.  But I don't care.  This album is great, and I would say that if you're looking for something to listen to while waiting for your wife to come home from work, this album is worth your time.

Amazon review: This is a great CD to get if your looking for a good rock album.  It is well produced, and the musicianship is so awesome it is hard to believe that it wasn't done live.  The CD is really good, and I would say that a good mix of rock, and some good lyrics make this CD a winner.

Amazon review: I bought it because it had so many cool songs.  This album has a great mix of rock and some good lyrics, but it is a little difficult to find information about the release on the CD case.  I got it in the mail, and I was excited to listen to it.  The only problem I found is that the CD has a lot of noise on it.  This CD really needs to be played in a quiet room, or at least in a room that has a neutral or no-noise environment.

Amazon review: This is an original release from Def Leppard.  I was looking for an original album, and I was looking for something that was not another "Ride of the Valkyries" or "Rock of Ages" or "Back In Black".  This album is great.

This is a great CD to get for those of you who are looking for an original album that you can listen to a couple of times, and you don't have to spend a lot of money on it.  I say this is a winner.

Amazon review: Billy Currington's album is great. It is one of the best albums I have ever heard. Billy is going to become one of the top artists in the next few years. Every one should buy this album!

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: What a lazy production from Pink Floyd as it's supposed last album. Very disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was not my favorite Pink Floyd album. It was certainly not one of the best. I believe that it was the first Floyd album made with a new producer, and that producer was a person who had never heard Pink Floyd before, who had only heard of what they had been doing previously, and who had not heard the best albums of Pink Floyd's.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a much better Pink Floyd album.  Most of the songs are very interesting, with some great moments and unique sound effects.  The only real flaw is that the sound was a little too bright and fuzzy.  The production is quite nice, with a nice mix of synthesizer sounds, flute, and even drums.  The mixing is good, but not as good as on the last album.  I have to say, however, that on this one they really made a great job of trying to make a different sound to the old sound of the Floyd.  The vocals seem to be a little bit more interesting and more "human" than previous albums, and the instrumentals are a bit more interesting.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album. It's definitely worth getting.  I like the sound of the songs, and the vocals have a nice sound to them. The instrumentation seems to be very interesting, and the songs range from a little more electronic to a bit more acoustic.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is good, but not great.

Amazon review: This is another great Floyd album, but it wasn't a masterpiece.  I would call it average, but that's because I have other Floyd albums to compare it with.  It is still a good album, especially if you like Floyd.  I still like the original Floyd quite a lot, but this is a nice alternate take on the Floyd sound.  I don't care for the new sound, but the old sound is still a great one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is my favorite Pink Floyd album.  I listen to it whenever I want to relax. I like it when I just sit and listen to it with no other music playing.  I'm glad I got it, and I'm glad I bought it.  I'm glad I heard it, and I'm glad I bought it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is one of the best Pink Floyd albums ever made, and probably the best of all of Pink Floyd's albums.  I think this is one of the best Pink Floyd records ever made, and I think it could be the best Pink Floyd record ever made.  It's certainly one of the best albums of all time, and I think it's one of the very best albums ever made.  I think it's the best Pink Floyd album ever made, and that's saying a lot.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is not a perfect album, but it is a very good album.  It's better than most of Floyd's previous albums, and it has more variety than most Floyd albums.  I think it's a very good album.

I read an article a few months ago in which a man claimed that the majority of people who buy CDs are just idiots who do not really like music.  I agree with him 100%.  The people who buy CDs are the same people that listen to radio all day long.  I know I do, I have been listening to the radio all day long since the day that I started listening.  I have my earphones in and I don't have to move a muscle to listen to any music.  I have a CD player, but the only thing I have to do is put the CD in and turn it on.  I can listen to music for hours at a time without ever being bored or getting bored.  I have a CD player and it's the only thing I have to do.  I can listen to the same song over and over again and it never gets boring.  I don't get bored listening to music.  I don't have to listen to music to be happy.  I don't have to listen to music to be happy.
