Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: This really is the best version of this song I've heard and I've heard many.  But this is the version I like best.  This is my favorite version of the song.  For me, it is that one version of this that has the most of the original magic and power.  The original is more powerful.  The version I love best is the one that is the closest to the original.  This version, however, is a lot better.  It's a little more subtle, which makes it more special.  When I heard this version, my first impulse was to pick it up and play it.  I have no idea how I've lived without it for so long.  I should have bought it sooner.  But that isn't fair, is it?  I've had that one version of the song for so long.  I should have taken it the moment I heard it.  But I waited too long.  By the time I finally realized it was this version I had to buy, it was too late.  But now, this is my version, and it is my favorite version of this one.

Amazon review: I'm a big Beatles fan.  I especially like the songs that have the longest verses.  But this song is one of the longest and I don't like that about it.  The only reason I've ever liked this song is because of the way Keith & Phil handled the song.  It's one of the greatest examples of a song with a long verse.  But the way they handled it was off.  And this version is one of the worst.  The song is too long.  It's so long it's almost like they didn't know what to do with it.  It's like they were trying to write a song but they couldn't come up with a title.  They couldn't come up with a title because it was so long.  And it's so long it's almost like they didn't know how to end it.  They didn't know how to end it because they couldn't come up with a title for it because it's so long.  And it's so long it's almost like they couldn't come up with a title for it because it's so much longer than they anticipated.  But that's the only thing I like about it.  I don't like the song.  I don't like the lyrics.  I don't like the music.  But I like the way they wrote it.  And I like the way they sang it.

Amazon review: I'm a huge Beatles fan.  I love all of their songs.  And this song, for me, is one of the greatest Beatles songs.  It reminds me so much of Liverpool.  It's got that Liverpool feeling.  And that's the way the song was written.  The song's so simple and short and to the point.  I don't know why people don't like it.  I think the reason why they don't like it is because they don't understand how good it is.  It's just like the greatest Beatles song ever.  And they never get credit for that.  And they don't get credit for what they did with it.  They never got credit for doing something they did with it.  They didn't get credit for the way they did it.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I bought this album as my son's birthday present.  I heard the songs on the radio and they sounded good.  I tried them out in my car and they sounded good too.  Then I tried them out at home, and they did not sound pleasant at all.  I have never had a music album that I could not get to play, but when the songs came on, they sounded like someone had taken a hammer to a CD.  They were all very unpleasant and were not very enjoyable to listen to at all.  I was so disappointed at the moment that I decided to put the cd away and listen to it on my way to another birthday party.  I did not listen to it at all for the rest of the night, and only listened to it once the next morning.  I have given up!

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Ray Sinatra.  If you love Ray Sinatra you will love this CD.  I bought this CD because I liked the idea of hearing music composed by Ray Sinatra.  The album is not meant to be played on the radio.  It is meant to be listened to.  I think the only reason I haven't bought this CD in the past is because of the price.  Now I know why the price is so cheap.  At first the cd sounded wonderful.  It was almost too good to be true.  The songs sounded like they had been recorded in a studio with special effects.  Now that I have listened to it for a while I feel a little disappointed.  I think the only reason why I didn't want the cd was because the songs are so good and so well composed.  I just thought that they would be too good to be true.  However, I have been pleasantly surprised.  This is definitely an album that I will be listening over and over again.

Amazon review: I am an old school musician.  I used to play all kinds of musical instruments and loved to play them!  I have played the violin, the cello, the piano, and the guitar.  I have also played in a band with other instruments and singers.  In fact, I have written music for the theater, commercials, and cartoons.  I have even performed at some of the best recording studios in the world including Abbey Road Studios, Hollywood, and Capitol Studios.  I love to play music.  I love to play the best music possible.  I am very glad that I found this new CD by Ray Sinatra.  I love it!  It is truly a gem!

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I think that the liner notes are a great idea for the album. They give you a great idea of the album and how it was created. Of course, there is a lot on Dylan, but it feels really homogenous. It doesn't feel like a collection of songs from a new Dylan album. It feels like a collection of Dylan songs he's played live, and recorded for his own album.

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.
