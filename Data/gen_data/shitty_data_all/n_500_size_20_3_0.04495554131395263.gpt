Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I have a lot of songs that I sing during the course of the day. That being said, I am often frustrated that songs that I sing aren't always utilized or used in a more effective way.  I have a lot of songs that I try and sing during the day, but I have found that oftentimes they just are put on shuffle because there is no plan for them.  This song is one of those songs that I want to use more often because it was written as a song to be sung at the beginning of the service.  The way it is presented is an absolute mess. It is just a song that should be sung at the beginning of the service, not the end.

Amazon review: I don't really get the hype on this track, but I really like it. I have heard several other songs that are sung by the same group called Worshipmob, but this one stands out.

Amazon review: The Beatles are my favorite band. They are my favorite band. No, I don't mean that metaphorically. This band was an amazing, great band. They are still amazing.  The Beatles are one of the greatest, most influential bands in music history.  I remember playing "I Want To Hold Your Hand" with my cousin in the living room, and she got so excited she started jumping around.  She sang the first two verses, and then we sang the last two verses together in the same song. It was amazing.  We laughed and we cried, and we had fun.  I had never seen anyone cry so much in my life when I sang the song.  And she thought it was so funny, too.  It was amazing.  I remember being in the car with my dad.  We were driving to see him at his new job. It was snowing, and we were driving slowly, listening to music.  I had put on "Can't Buy Me Love" by the Beatles, and I sang along with them.  We sang it over and over again.  I never forgot it.  It was amazing.  The Beatles are my favorite band. I love them.

Amazon review: I want to say that I saw this band from the time I was a toddler. I know that doesn't make sense because I was born in the late 90s, but it's true.  I saw them at a concert in front of my dad's house.  There was a young guy who was singing and dancing.  I remember being very young and I said to myself, "Wow, that's really good."

I have seen The Beatles live, I saw The Doors play, and I saw Bob Dylan back in the day.  I have seen so many amazing bands, and I have never seen so many bands that sounded so amazing.  I have never seen a band that sounded so amazing.  The Beatles were my favorite band.  The Beatles were so amazing, and they were my favorite band.  I don't know why they are so well known.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

So I bought the CD. It was worth every penny.

Amazon review: The first thing you have to know about this album is that it is a compilation, it contains just one or two songs from each of the five albums, and the albums are:

1. The B-Sides
2. The Albums

and they are:

1. The Singles
2. The B-Sides

but the song order and the order of the songs in the albums is not known, and it is unknown which songs are on which albums.

I love this album. It is a collection of songs that are so different, but they work so well together. This is a great album to listen to at any time. It has a lot of energy and is full of great songs that are very catchy. I like that you can play the whole album in one sitting without getting bored, which is a good thing to have when you are listening to music. This album is very unique and you can hear the different styles in the different songs. You can't help but feel that you are listening to a different person singing different songs. This album has a lot of great songs on it. I can't wait to hear what songs come next.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

In the song, she is upset that her brother has taken all of her money and has gone to jail, and she feels guilty about the fact that she has never been able

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would love to hear this album, but I don't have it.  I don't understand the fuss about this CD.  I've never been one to go into an album with an "experience" for the sake of it.  I have a feeling this album has a lot of great songs, but I have a feeling the entire album will sound bad, but if you like the songs it will be an entertaining listen.  I have a feeling Josh is going to sound very different from what we've heard in the past, but when I listen to a song I have no idea what it's going to sound like, but I always like to be a little surprised.  I'm very picky about music and I think this album is going to sound great, but I have no idea what is going to happen.  I've never been a big fan of Josh's singing voice, but he has some great songs, and I'm glad he's getting back to performing.  I'll probably play his album just to hear the sound of the songs, but I don't know if I'll know what to expect.  He may be a little different from what's been done in the past, but I think his songs will be great.  I'm just not sure if I'm interested in this album.  It's good that he's releasing a CD that he's not going to be in the video for, but I think in order to make his album sound better he should tone down the nasally, and I think he did a little too much in the first CD.  His singing is great and I'm glad he's back playing with us, but I guess i'm a little disappointed.

Amazon review: The world was a different place when I first heard "The World".  The melodies are simple and heartfelt, and the lyrics are beautiful.  I still love the song, but I feel that listening to the CD now, the music has become a little dull.  Its a little too "safe".  I'm trying to figure out if its a song that is getting old, or if its my ears.  I'm not sure.  It's good that Josh is back, but I think he's changed his style and the songs sound dull, but I don't know why.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have heard Josh sing live.  However, his vocal range is limited and he does not have the range that he once had.  His voice is a little flat and unimpressive.  His singing is not as powerful as it once was.  I do enjoy listening to Josh sing.  I like the fact that he's continuing to perform.  However, I don't really like the sound of Josh's voice.  He sounds tired.  I don't know if he's going to change, but he may have to sing differently.  I think he should stick with the same voice for a while.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: His voice is so full, rich, and powerful that it could have been the star of his own CD, but for me, he sounds lifeless, the sound of the CD is dull, and he just sounds like a tired old man singing.

Amazon review: I know this album isn't going to be a classic.  It seems like a commercial CD, but I like what Josh has done with it.  I don't mind the sound of the CD, and I like the lyrics.  However, I don't really like his singing voice.  I don't know what happened, but it sounds very tired, like he is just singing for the sake of singing and not singing for the sake of singing.  I don't know if he is or is not going to change, but I do know that his singing voice sounds like it has aged.  I don't like the sound of his voice, and I think he should not be singing in the style that he is singing in the songs.  It sounds like it's going to be a commercial CD that he'll be singing in the video for.  I like it that he's singing in the video for the songs, but I would have preferred the songs to be good, not just a song CD.  It would be nice if the songs were good.

BRIAN KILMEADE 'S 'HAPPY HOLIDAY' PICKS

From the New York Times:

The new season of "The Simpsons" will come to an end on Dec. 21.

The episode, titled "The Great Christmas Truce," will be the show's last.

The show is set to air its 13th season on Fox. "The Simpsons" has averaged 18 million viewers this season, a decline of 1.4 million viewers from its first season.

The show has already aired several episodes in December, including "The Longest Day" which was watched by 7.5 million viewers. There will be more episodes, including "The Springfield Files," "Treehouse of Horror VII," "Treehouse of Horror IX" and "Treehouse of Horror XII," which will air in the first quarter of next year.

In the new season, the show will have one new episode, "My Life as a Dog," which will air in January.

"The Simpsons" is a show that has a long history with the "Hollywood branch" of the Walt Disney Company.

The show was born in the early '90s when a group of animators were seeking a way to fill the big-budget animation slots in the television marketplace. In addition to "The Simpsons," they were developing a show based on the character of Bugs Bunny, who would have starred with the animators as a cartoon.

The Disney Company, which had purchased most of the Fox Broadcasting Company in 1995, decided to take the show to a new level. The "Simpsons" would get a whole new look.

The original "Simpsons" was going to be a comedy show, but after the Disney purchase, the creators decided to turn it into a full-length animated series.

The first episode of the new season, "Flaming Moe's", shows Homer Simpson, Moe Szyslak, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and other Simpsons characters as

The song "Ain't It Hard" is a great example of a Dylan song that really lets you know he can really sing, not just in a loud way, but also a very strong way. He just has great pipes on this song. That said, other songs are not as strong. "Hurricane" is a weak song. It's not a bad song at all, but it's nothing special. I also like "Bring Him Home". The song "She Believes in You" is my favorite, and I think "Maggie's Farm" is a great song as well.

"All I Really Wanna Do" is a song that is not as good as the other songs on the album, but "Hurricane" is the best song on the album. The album ends with a song called "Masters of War" which I personally like, but other songs on the album are not my favorite.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: I've had a CD for a couple of years but I don't think I've heard this one in that time. I like it, it's not my normal style. The only thing that i don't like about it is the song "P.S." It is almost like it's been recorded a year ago.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: It's a good-looking CD with a nice cover, but why does it sound so cheap?  This is by far the worst Cd MJ has released.  It doesn't even have the same songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great Cd but I don't understand why these would be on it.  The cover is nice but the songs are just terrible.  The tracks are very similar.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Love the cover and the music is great but this is just a waste of money.  If I could give this one star, I would.  But I can't.  I like the cover and the music.  I just don't like the songs.  These songs are just terrible.  They sound like they were recorded in a garage in a day.

Amazon review: This is so bad I'm not sure if I like it or hate it.  It's just so bad.  I bought this cd to go to the movies with and I was so disappointed.  It's just terrible.  There is no way this cd could be better than this one.  When this one comes out I will buy it and wait for it.  Then I will be disappointed.  I will buy this one later.  Until then, I will wait for the new one.  I hope it is as good as this one.  I want to cry everytime I listen to this cd.  I just can't stand it.  I bought it because I like MJ and all.  And I love him.  But I just don't like this one.  He just doesn't have a good voice.  This is the second CD I have bought that he produced and I just don't like it.  I won't buy another at all.  It's bad.  I will never buy a cd by him.  I don't care if it's a million dollars.  I don't care if it's free.  I don't care.  I just don't like him.  I just don't like him.  I just don't.  He is just so bad.  I just don't like everything he has to say.  He is just so stupid and he is so ugly.  I just don't like him.  I don't like his ugly face.  I just don't like him.  If I had to do it over again, I would have done it different.  I just don't like him.  I just don't want to listen to his stupid songs.  I just don't like him.  I don't like him.  I just don't like him.  He is just so ugly.  I just don't like him.  This is just a waste of money.  If I had to do it over again, I would have bought this cd.  I would have bought this one.  I would have bought this one.  I would have bought it.  I would have bought it.  I would have bought it and I would have waited until it was free.  I just don't like him.  I just don't really like him.  I just don't like him.  I just dont like him.  I just don't like him.  I just really don't like him.  I just don't like him.  If I could take it back, I would have bought this one.  I just don't like him.  I just don't mind.  I would have bought this one.  I just don't like him yet.  I just don't like him.  I just don't listen to his stuff.  I just don't like him.  I just don't care.  I just don't like him.  I don't like it.  I just don't like him.  I just don't know what's going on.  I just don't like him.  I just don't hear anything.  I just don't like him.  I just don't even care.  I just don't like him.  I just don;t like his songs.  I just don't like his songs.  I just don't like them.  I just don't like his stupid lyrics.  I just don't like his songs.  I just don;t like his songs.  I just really don't like him.  I really don't like him.  I really don't

Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.
