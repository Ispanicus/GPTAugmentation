Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: This album is full of good songs.  I like the way the songs are arranged and organized.  It's a good album, but I think it is a little too busy for my taste.  I liked some of the songs and I like the other songs.  I like the way the song "Praise is What I Do" is written.  I just wish we could have had the lyrics back.  I would like to have seen the lyrics for "Jesus Loves You".  That one I have not heard since the 70's.  That was one of my favorite songs.  I also like the way "My Savior".  I liked the other songs, but it was too busy for my taste.

Amazon review: This CD is very, very good.  I like the way the songs are arranged.  I like the way the songs are written.  I like the way there is no drums.  The voice is very good and clear.  The song "Praise is What I Do" is a very nice song.  I like the songs "Jesus Loves You", "My Savior" and "The Cross".  The song "Lord I Am God" is very, very good and very well sung.  I like the lyrics for "I am God".  I liked the song "It's a Place in the Heart" but it was too quiet and I did not like the song "God of Love" at all.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: "What a Wonderful Life" by Dolly Parton.  This was purchased for my niece for Christmas and I am glad I did.  The songs are great and the CD is very enjoyable.  However, the packaging is so poor that I have returned it.  The cover is ugly, the CD is loose, the sleeves are so dirty that I have asked for them to be returned.  The CD is $14.95.  I am so disappointed with the CD.  I have already returned the $14.95.  I am only on my 4th CD.  I have been on the Internet to find this CD on some site.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As I'm sure you know, there is a lot of variety in the music on this CD.  I like that it does not contain any of his more recent stuff.

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I received this CD, which was sent to me by my friend, who had purchased it from Amazon.  It is NOT a CD that I thought I would receive.  I am not the type of person to get a CD on a random night - so I didn't get a CD.  I was surprised, though, that I was the only person who got the CD and I was just as surprised that it was a beautiful, well-crafted piece of music.  I didn't know about the "secret" song that the album mentions, but I am glad I did find out because I was looking forward to hearing something new.  I have heard several comments about the song that is on the CD and I am very glad I did not get a copy of that song.  The song that was on the CD is, however, a beautifully composed piece of music and I am glad that others will be hearing it and maybe even singing it with me one day.  I can't say that I will buy the CD from this source again, but I will keep this CD for my own enjoyment if I ever need a similar piece of music.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I think the song is pretty much perfect for this movie, and I also think that the movie is well worth it and that the music fits the mood perfectly. The movie is about a father who goes to a concert in which a guy who was an astronaut and a musician gets killed so that his wife doesn't lose her job. The wife, who was also an astronaut, is heartbroken over what happened and decides that she's going to get drunk and become a recluse to escape the pain. The father and his wife go to the concert and get drunk, and the father is killed when he falls off the stage. The mother dies of a heart attack in the bathroom and the father's wife dies in her apartment.

Amazon review: I have a lot of fond memories of listening to my dad playing the "You've Got A Friend" and "For You" albums. For some odd reason, I have always assumed these were for my dad (and I'm pretty sure my dad didn't know that I actually bought them). I was very sad to hear that he bought these albums for me, but I guess it's okay, because they're all still here. And I'll never forget the day he brought home a new album, "You've Got A Friend" by Paul McCartney, and I was so excited for it. I could hear that it was the new album and I thought it was so much better than the old ones. I also remember the time I finally got my first CD player and I was thrilled to find out my dad had bought this album for me. I had heard the songs on the radio, but had never seen them in print, so when I saw that it was a brand new, brand new album, I told him the album had to be mine, and he said he knew right then and there that I would be the first to have this new album. My dad was always very interested in music and in music history, so I suppose he just thought it was a gift. He listened to some songs on the album and then, after some conversation, he brought the album into the living room and played it for me. I was very excited to hear the songs and I loved them. When I listened to the album again, though, I started to hear the songs in my head (that's how they start, you know), so I just stopped playing the album. I didn't like the album, and I didn't like the songs that I heard in my head. I had a lot of anger and hurt inside me and I felt like I had lost my father. I didn't know why, but I felt like I'd lost my dad somehow, and I hated that album and everything it symbolized. And then, that night, I was listening to the album again and it was the first time I had really listened to the album in quite a while. I was still upset but I was listening to the songs in my head and I couldn't understand something that I was hearing, and it made me so sad. I ended up playing the album for the first time in a really long time, and I could hear the songs in my head, and I was really annoyed. I was very upset with the album and I hated it. I was really upset with myself for not listening to it in a long time, and I felt like I had let my dad down, not listened to the album in a long time and not played it for my dad. So I ended up playing it for the second time in a really long time, and I was really annoyed. I felt really bad and I hated the album. But it was the only album I had ever played for my dad and I was really mad at myself for not listening to it in a long time and playing it for my dad, and yet, I was really mad at the album and I hated it. I really hated the album and my dad for buying it for me, and I felt really good about myself for buying it. I decided that I would really like to listen to the album again, so I went into the bedroom and listened to the album. I was really annoyed by the album and I hated it.

Amazon review - I have heard quite a few reviews of this album, and they are all excellent.  However, this album is not for the faint hearted.  It is a very aggressive death metal album with a huge amount of vocals.  The guitar work is impressive.  The production quality on this CD is phenomenal.  It does not matter what age you are, this album will keep you wanting more.  The vocals are amazing.  The song structure on this album is very complex, with many different sections.  There are also many different guitar solo's.  A lot of the guitar work on this album is in the vein of old Testament.  The first few seconds of the CD is in the style of old Exodus.  There is a lot of the old style in the guitar work on this album.  It is a very good album for those who are new to death metal.  It is also great for those who have been in the death metal scene for a while, but have not really listened to any death metal and are trying to find new bands to follow.  If you like death metal, you will like this album.  I have not been a fan of death metal my whole life.  I have been listening to a lot of black metal, but I have only really listened to a few death metal albums.  I have listened to bands like Necrophagia, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, Autopsy, and Morbid Angel.  I have never listened to any Death Metal.  This album changed my mind.  I know how to listen to death metal.  I have listened to this album for over an hour and a half.  I can't believe I am not the only one who enjoys this album.  This album is a MUST HAVE for any death metal fan.  I would recommend this album to any death metal fan.  I am glad I had this album and I am glad I bought it.  I am glad I have the CD because I am very thankful that I have it.  I am glad I have this album because it is a great album.  I love this album, and I am glad I bought it.

I am glad I had this album because it is great.  I am glad I have this CD because it is a great album, and I am glad I bought it and I am glad I have it.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: As the title suggests, this is another one of the 'new' albums from the late great Jan Garbarek.  I was expecting something more in the classical vein, and was not disappointed.  His vocals are very nice, and the instrumental playing is very good, if not quite up to scratch.  He has a new album out with Nonesuch Records, and it is worth picking up - I'm sure I'll have a listen to the CD before I make my final decision.

Amazon review: This CD is a gem.  The first two tracks are a bit repetitive, but the rest of this CD is wonderful.  Very well produced and performed.  The songs are all very well written as well.

I have always said that his music is the most beautiful one which I have ever heard, and I am not ashamed to say that I love it and I hope that he continues to be in the band.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: The sound quality is horrible.  The only thing that made it good was the fact that it sounded like it had been recorded in a basement, not in any studio, which makes it much easier to review.  The whole thing was an experiment to see if you could record a band live and sound it back on tape.  It worked, but the sound quality was awful.  I found that when I turned the volume up, it sounded like I was in a basement.  And there were only three or four songs on the tape.  But I did hear some good stuff.  Not worth listening to, but interesting.

Amazon review:  This was a live recording from a local band called the Shreds.  All I can say is that this band sounded like they played in their hometown.  The song "Shred" was very short and played on a drum machine and guitar.  I didn't think anything of it at first, until I heard the lyrics.  They were really good.  Not only was the sound quality good, but the lyrics were very good.  The song was about how a person can be a great friend and a great enemy.  They were pretty good.  The lyrics I hear most are about how much a person cares for people.  Maybe not the best lyrics, but they were very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this is a terrible song.  It does sound like it would be a hit if it was sung by anyone other than Tom Waits.  The instrumentation is so bizarre that it makes it difficult to figure out what song it could be.  It sounds like the members of this project are either performing for themselves, or for the other members of their band.  The song does sound like it would be fun to listen to, but it just makes you think that maybe this band was a mistake.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very interesting.  Great vocals.  I don't think I've heard anyone sing like that in a long time.  The instrumentation on this CD was a little strange, but it was good.  I find it hard to listen to when there isn't much bass.  This was the only one that had low bass.  And it wasn't bad.  There wasn't much percussion, but the drums were a little too loud.  It would have been a great record if they had only recorded the bass.  But there were others that were really good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is not worth listening to.  It sounds like a demo tape or a poor quality recording.  The vocals are okay, but the bass sound very bad.  And the other instruments sounded good, but the bass drowned everything out.  The only thing that stood out was that the drummer did a great job on the bass drum.  And I was actually impressed.  The bass is not what makes the record bad.  The main bad thing is that I can't figure out what song this is.  I have no idea what instrumentation this is, but there are a few instruments that all sound the same.  But there are no vocals.  And the song is very short.  I think it's a great song, but I can't figure out what it is.  If there was a bassline, maybe it would have been better.  But there was nothing.
Sentiment: Negative

It was good though.  The songs were good, and the instrumentation was very good.  The only problem was the bass, which was very low.  I didn't mind though.  It was great.  It was the only song on the CD that I couldn't listen to on the way home.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

However, when I listened to "I Can't Quit You" I immediately became interested in the band. I had no idea who they were, but their music was really good. The vocals were not at all annoying, and I was really impressed with the musicianship. I will definitely purchase this cd again.

I immediately turned to listen to the lyrics, and even more excited when I heard them.  I have to give thanks to John Frusciante for writing this song.  I was not a fan of his previous work, but I have to say this is the best song I have ever listened to.  I love it.

Amazon review: If you don't know the lyrics to this song, you need to stop reading this review.  It's not my fault.  I was trying to tell you what a great song this is.  I was listening to REO Speedwagon, and I heard a song on the radio that said "I Can't Quit You".  I was so disappointed in myself for not knowing the lyrics.  I quickly looked it up on my computer and found the lyrics.  I was elated when I found out that the voice is John Frusciante.  When I listened to the song, the music and the lyrics were just a perfect match.  I was completely amazed by how this song was written.  It was so creative and so well written.  I was really amazed that John wrote this song; it was just perfect for the song that it was.  Now I know why everyone is saying that I can't quit you.  If it was a man, I would have quit you a long time ago.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: John Frusciante wrote this great song about how he is a true fan of REO Speedwagon.  Of course, he is referring to the lyrics and music of this song.  (It's really hard for me to find lyrics for most of my songs, and I'm pretty sure those lyrics are on here somewhere).  This song is a good reminder that we can never lose that inner fan that we are.  It's an important lesson that everyone should take time to listen to.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of a night I had with my best friend and her family.  This is the type of song that makes you smile and makes you remember why you enjoy listening to music in the first place.  I love how John Frusciante sings this song and how he uses the guitar to make the most out of this song.  This song has a great message.  I love it!  And this is why I love REO Speedwagon.  I was really impressed with this song.  I like it!  I liked it when I first heard it, but I really liked it when I listened it again.  I think it's because as I listened to it, my mind went back to the night I had with my best friend and her family.  I really like the message of the song, and I think everyone should listen to this song and think about the past and make the best out of it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review:  I grew up with this great classic song. It is one of those songs that you can hear on the radio and never be able to forget it. My cousin who also grew up with this song introduced me to it. It was one of the first songs I knew that was about Jesus. I have actually had it in my car ever since. I love this song because it has a great message and a simple yet catchy melody, and it is just a great song to listen to. I really wish it was on more CD's.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is the classic song that introduced me to the term "alternative Christian music"... I listened to this song on repeat as a child.  I heard the song in my church nursery and listened to it as I got ready for Sunday School. It was always on in my little heart.  My parents were always asking me to play it on a religious station at Church before I went to bed.  This song is one of the best songs ever... I just love the melody and the message.  It is awesome that this song was recorded by a Christian band, a Christian group, not just a Christian singer. I love the message of this song.  This song is a blessing in my life.  I recommend this song to everyone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This song is one of my all time favorites. It has a great sing along chorus and I love the message of the song.  I have it on my car and play it every summer.

I do not know why I did not have it in my car.  I do not know why I did not get it when I ordered it.  I am not sure why I was not notified when I ordered it.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good song.  I think what makes it so good is the arrangement.  When I first heard this song I thought it was a perfect pop song.  The first thing I notice is the harmonies in this song.  It would be a good song if every instrument was not part of the choral arrangement.  The second thing I notice is the melody in this song.  The melody is a great example of how a melody can be written in many different ways.  This melody came to me in a different way than it was written.  The third thing I notice is the lyrics.  The words in this song are very simplistic and it is a great example of using simple words to tell a story.  The lyrics are very simple and very true.  This is a great song.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first track "Never Going Back Again" is a great rock song, with a great guitar intro. The second track "What's Wrong With Heartache" is a great country song, but lacks the rock influence. However, it is a very good song and a great start to the album.
