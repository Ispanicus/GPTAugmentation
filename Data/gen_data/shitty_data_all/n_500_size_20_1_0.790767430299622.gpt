Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.  It doesn't work and all the things they told me to do to fix it I had ALDREADY told them I had done previous to contacting them.  They were no help and I am out.99 (big deal) but still have no song.

Amazon review: I am getting this one for free because my ex-boyfriend has this cd.  I don't know if he gave it to me or it came from him.  I never heard him play it.  I am waiting for the cd to come in the mail.  No more free stuff.

Amazon review: I received this cd from my local record store and I am very happy with it.  I am not sure if this is the real thing or not, but I am happy with it.  It is a good song.  Just not a classic.  I will probably buy a copy if it is on sale.

I like "The one" especially the first part. I like "Don't stop believing" especially the intro and the part where Cher tells the kids to have faith in themselves.

I like "If you're looking for a little romance..." and "My world" especially the part where Cher says:" I guess it's just a little love song."

I like "Alive again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" mainly the last chorus.

I like the video a lot. Cher is really cool.

I also like "I'll be there" and "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" mainly the last part.

I like "Something There", "Cher, Cher" and "I love you" also "I'm a little bit insane".

The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: One of my favorite Dylan albums. A masterpiece!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for a couple of months.  I really like it.  It has a nice sound, it's a good song, and she has a nice voice.  But the quality is not anywhere near what it should be.  I purchased it for my wife's birthday.  Now I can't get it to work on her iPod.  When I tried to download it I got an error message saying "you don't have the right software".  I know it's supposed to be like this, but my wife has no clue.  If she doesn't like it and tells me so then I'll give it back.  I don't want to pay for a CD with a bad quality because of her ignorance.

I was able to find a new buyer for this album, but the seller has since been removed.

The seller was asking for $35.00 plus shipping. It is now listed at $28.00 plus shipping. This is the same price as the seller originally listed.

The seller is a new buyer, and I have no idea how this happened.

The seller was making a very negative review of the Amazon seller.

The seller said he had to cancel the order because the CD was not playable. I'm surprised he didn't cancel the entire order.

The seller was saying the CD was scratched on the back cover, and the CD was not playable.

The seller was also saying the CD was not playable, but I'm going to assume this is not true.

The seller was also asking for $35.00 plus shipping. It is now listed at a much lower price, $28.00 plus

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: It's odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it. It was just some breathing noise and what I assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy. I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend

Amazon review: I was born in a small town in Wisconsin and grew up listening to country music.  I also got along with my family's music and listened to it all the time.  I grew up with Kenny Chesney. But there is a song I don't ever remember hearing of him that I would like to hear again. The lyrics are just fantastic.  He really captures the feeling of love.  I like a song that is filled with love.  I was listening to this song on my ipod while I was driving the other day listening to this song and it really made me feel good. The song is great. I would buy it and listen to it again. I'm impressed.  I really enjoy the lyrics.

I think it would be funny if he sang "I would like to believe he will" as that would be a bad example of a song to use.  I like the song anyway.  I think it has good lyrics.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album and all of the songs are great except for the last two tracks. I get annoyed with the fact that they don't get better songs out, or put out a new song on the first album, not a second one.  I don't care about hearing a new song, they all sound the same, they don't get better songs, and they don't change their songs.  I don't mind them playing the same songs over and over as long as they do change them.  However, they should change the last 2 songs on each album.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of these guys since the very beginning when they came out with their first album.  I love the songs, their sound, and the fact that they are a little different from most of the other bands out.  I feel that this is one of the best albums of this genre.  I am a sucker for a good acoustic song.  The songs that I would usually skip, are my favorites are "Better Man" and "The Way".  The song "The Way" is my favorite song of the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  It is very good.  I like the songs.  I like the sound.  However, the one song that really stands out to me is "I Need Your Love".  The song is just great.  The only song that I would like to hear them do a new is "I Think I Found You".  I don't want to wait for a new album.  I would be lying if I said that I did not like this album the first time I heard it.  I would like to hear them do a new album.  The only problem with this album is that I don't think they will.  I also like their single "Boys and Girls".  I don't understand why they did not do a new single with that song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really don't know why I even bothered with buying this album.  I really don't think I get it and I am not even sure why I would buy this album.  I guess I just needed to be reminded about how great rock music can be.  I love the songs, the songs that I always liked, I really liked the songs that I liked the first time I heard them, the songs that I would skip, the songs that I liked the first time, but not the second time, but the third time, the songs that I would never change, even though I am only going to listen to them for about 4 minutes at a time, the songs that are just on the album, but I love them, the songs that will always be in my playlist, and the songs that I will not skip.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is very disappointing.  It is no longer the band that I admired for years.  They have changed.  They seem to have become the same person they were before.

My favorite song is "I Need Your Love", which is the only song I like on the album.  The other 3 songs I don't like at all.  I don't understand why they didn't do a new single.  I have bought many singles off their albums and this is the first single I have not liked.  I don't understand why they have not made a new single.  The only songs I like on the album are "Why Wait" and "You Belong to Me".  The song "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" is good but nothing really stands out to me.  I also like the songs "Better Man" and "I Think I Found You".  I don't know why they didn't do a new single with the song "I Need Your Love".  I don't understand why they didn't do a new single with the song "Don't Go Breaking My Heart".  I don't understand why they did not put out a new single.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: This song is great and it makes me feel like I am at my grandfather's funeral.  I have been listening to it for the last couple of days and it is getting better I just wish I had it with me all the time.  I have been telling people about it and they just can't listen to it because they are not a fan.  I have a lot of great songs that I don't play as often as this one but this one is my favorite.  This song brings back such great memories for me.  I can still hear the sound of my grandfather's funeral and can feel his pain as tears fill his eyes as he sings this song.  It makes me cry every time I listen to it.
