Amazon review: My dad really loves these guys and he was going crazy over this song so I decided to get it for him.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's definitely a crying shame that these guys have been together for so little time. This Paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz, post-bop and avant-garde. By listening to it you can find out why Chick Corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60's and why Dave Holland was and still is one of the most important bass players in the world. Barry Altschul is superb as well and yes, Anthony Braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his bandmates but he fits here great anyway.

Amazon review: Dear Fireflight,  Please release electro-pop under another name or as side projects. This will, I believe, alienate your current fans, I know it has me. If I wanted Christian Katy Perry, then I would listen to, uh, old Katy Perry.

Amazon review: It was in the middle of the night and I was watching some TV. I was so into the movie 'The Dark Knight' and listening to the soundtrack I just wanted to hear the song. I am one of the few people who listens to music while watching a movie. I don't watch movies while I am driving, or playing tennis or golf. I listen to music while I am watching movies and while I am cooking. I listen to music while I am watching movies and while I am cleaning. I listen to music while I am waiting for the kids to get out of school. I listen to music while I am cooking and I play the radio in the background. So I really have a love for music and movies in one.

Amazon review: This is a very good song. I love how the vocals are the main thing in it, but the other instruments come in. I like this song. I have listened to this song about ten times. I like the song. I have been listening to this song for a long time now. It's been around for a long time. I wanted to give this a negative review because the vocals are supposed to be all about the different parts that go together to form the song. It's a good song, but it's a little more than what I expected from the band. I like this song very much. I have listened to this song in my car for a long time. I like the song. I have liked this song for a long time. I have listened to this song for a long time. I like the song. I have liked this band for a long time.

Amazon review: This is probably one of the best songs I have ever heard. I have to admit, I don't really like this band. I don't know why. Maybe I just don't like the music they make. But, I have to say that 'When We Were Young' is one of the best songs I have ever heard. And I have listened to this song a lot. I've listened to this song when it was a single. I have listened to this song when it was a single. It's a great song. It's a good song. It's a great song.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: K. 482 is the most visionary, musically-expressively complex, and difficult-to-bring-off of Mozart's piano concertos, a true concerto for wind instruments, piano and orchestra. Fischer, as conductor, extracts unusually well-balanced, articulate, expressive performances from this "minor" orchestra (in itself a remarkable feat), while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work.  Some might question whether this is "Mozart-styled" performance; no, but it should be.

However, thanks to amazon showing that this resource exists for free, I was able to find the site "bible.is". On that site they have the complete Bible, plus they have both dramatized and non-dramatized versions of KJV, NASB, ESV, and contemporary English. If this product didn't need to be downloaded through cloud player, I would have given it a 4/5 stars.

From the moment I opened the box, I knew I was going to love this album. I was pleasantly surprised and amazed at the quality of the vinyl. The quality of the packaging and the fact that it came in a box, with a picture of the album, was a great touch. I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a great, quality album.

This is a fabulous CD. My 5 year old and 3 year old boys love this CD. It is easy to listen to. The songs are short but they have an amazing beat. It is perfect for the kids to listen to while doing their homework and activities. The pictures and the illustrations are awesome. The kids are still singing the song when they are playing with toys. We have played the CD over and over. You will love this CD. I know I do. It is a must have.

There are so many songs on this CD that I couldn't choose just one. It is the perfect gift for any occasion. We love it when my kids sing the songs to each other. It is always a great treat for us to hear them sing together. They sound so happy and this CD is the perfect way to show them how much they are loved.

I was surprised by the quality of the music. After several plays, I had to tell myself to stop being such a perfectionist. It is all right for me to have some musical imperfections, it means I am a person. I am having a great time listening to this album with my family. Thank you for sharing this CD.

We have a 5 year old and 2 year old. The lyrics are so fun for the young ones and the songs fit the songs well. I love all the songs on this CD. I am sure the parents will enjoy listening to this with their kids. We've enjoyed this CD a lot.

I've been looking for a way to share my boys music with my daughters, so I ordered this CD. The boys absolutely love it and they are singing all the songs. I even made the boys play the CD while we were in the car on the way to the park. The boys would sing the songs and the car would be filled with the beautiful sound of my daughter and her friends singing along.

This CD is awesome! My oldest is a very sensitive child and it's helped him to be able to share the songs with others. We've played the CD to him and he's been able to sing along without being embarrassed. The songs are a little repetitive since the songs repeat in the same way, but it's something that can be worked out when you introduce the songs to your children. My daughter loves this CD.

I love this CD! My 4 year old son loves it. He is often singing to himself and I think it keeps him busy. It is a little monotonous, but I find it to be really good. I would recommend this CD to all parents who want their little ones to enjoy music.

This is the second time I've ordered this CD. The first time, I ordered the CD for my 5 year old and 6 month old. I did so because the 5 year old often sings this song to

Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.

Amazon review: After an adequate if a little bland debut album, i expected and anticipated great things from Lifehouse. Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I. There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless. I have a very varied taste in music and I do know a melody when it comes my way, but there is no melody on this album worth writing about.

Amazon review: To all who have destructively criticized Jewel's latest album, 0304, take notice that ALL artists: writers, actors, musicians, painters, etc., etc, have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rates. Artists like Jewel have to project different images twenty-four seven, whether it's their look and/or work. Moreover, change can sometimes be difficult to accept, but that's life. Nothing stays the same, everything changes.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.  The sound file looks like a brick.  This type of remaster is what gives digital sound a bad name and makes people long for vinyl.  It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!

Amazon review: A few days ago I bought the sisters' album Festival, and loved every single song.  Based on that, I sampled all the songs on this album to see if I should download it.  After hearing these songs, I definitely will not be purchasing this album.  The girls are definitely beautiful, all right.  It's easy to see why they're so well-loved because of it.  But on this album, their voices haven't matured enough to enjoy listening to, no matter how pretty they are.

Amazon review: I absolutely love this album.  It's got some really great songs on it, and the music is good for listening to while doing chores.  I don't like the one song on this album, though.  It's a little repetitive, and it just doesn't have a lot to offer.  The only song that's really good on this album is the last song of the album.

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  The rest of Van Halen are doing a terrific job, but David Lee Roth should be put out to pasture.  I can't believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance.  Problems:  1.  David Lee Roth thinks he's David Lee Roth circa 1978.  As such, he feels free to take liberties and "sing" the songs incorrectly. 2.  He only "sings" half of the lyrics, the rest are spoken. 3.  He adds all kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics.

Amazon review: I was out christmas shopping today and the store I was in was playing this cd in the background.  When I went to purchase my item I heard the store manager talking with a worker standing behind me.  The manager asked what music they were playing and the worker responded "the new Jessica Simpson Christmas cd".  I heard the manager then reply "can you please stop the music, it's scaring the customers and it's really bad for business."  I was so enthralled and fascinated at this point I had to find out why the store manager made that comment and why she was so insistant that they cut the cd off.

Amazon review: I just started this album today.  I love the way that it has no vocals or instrumentation except for the piano.  The only thing that I can think of is that the lyrics are a little cryptic and hard to understand.  Not bad though it is the only album that has me not thinking of David Lee Roth.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is such a great album.  I just wanted to play it and have the lyrics come to me.  I love the way the chords progress and the way that the words are sung with just the right amount of melody.  I have been listening to this album for several years now.  I cannot stop playing it.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of David Lee Roth since the 70's.  I love his music.  His music has got to be one of the best that I have heard.

Amazon review: I started to buy this album in the middle of the night.  I just couldn't get enough of it.  The album is awesome and I love that Roth sings every word as it is sung.  He has a great voice and it just gets better and better.  I think that some people may not like the lyrics because they are not that complicated.  However, the words are sung very well and they are a lot of fun.  I have been listening to this album all day and I just love it.

Amazon review: I have never heard David Lee Roth sing this song.  I just bought this cd and am so glad to have this album in my collection.  I love the fact that you can only play one side of the CD at a time.  I love the lyrics.  I love the guitar playing.  The music is very good and the quality of the songs is great.  This is a great cd.  The best part is when you play it the whole message comes to you and you can repeat it over and over.  When I first heard the song I thought that he was just singing to the "man of the house" and the lyrics were very similar to the ones that I used to hear growing up.  But, when I listened to the song again, I realized that he is singing to his wife.  This is just a great cd.  I love everything about it.

Amazon review: The problem with getting the previews is that they never let you hear the ends of song.  I don't know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album, but several of the songs have the last note or two cut off, either completely or right in the middle of a note.  Not a lot of joy there.  I will say that there are some songs on the album that are fine, but getting slammed like that really ruins everything.  I'll probably go through the album again and remove these songs from my device.

I heard it once through and that was enough.  I don't think it's a money grab, it just sucks.  Edit: perhaps Floyd, or at least those that remain, deserve an album retrospect, in whatever way they desire.

Amazon review: I'm a BIG Van Halen fan. but. this live album is a lttle too late. Dave, Dave, Dave. wassup?  He had it together for the initial reunion tour, but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career. He no longer seems interested in SINGING the lyrics, but rather talking, and mumbling his way through them. Although not 100%. he still has the chops if he chooses to use them. his very recent Foo Fighters appearance singing Panama, shows he can do better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I would have given this 5 stars except for the fact I don't like "No more Mr. Nice Guy" and "I'll Be Your Mirror" at all.  Both are pretty annoying and they are the only songs on the album I haven't heard before.

Amazon review: I think this is a great album. Not many bands put out new material after all these years and I'm glad they did.  I don't really like the solo stuff on this album.

Amazon review: "Dirty" is a great song, and a great album, but to each his own.  If you like Van Halen, you'll like this.  The best thing about it is that it's not a Van Halen album.  I think that's where it's at.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a great album, but I don't think it makes up for the lack of Van Halen.  I thought that they would do a new album on their own and maybe tour together, but I couldn't believe they would even do this album.  It's a great album and I'm glad they put out this album to get their name out there.  But it's not a Van Halen album.  They did not put out a new album just to get their name out there.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album for Van Halen fans.  The solo stuff is not great though.  Dave and Tommy had a lot of solo stuff done and I don't think it's as good as the solo stuff that they put out on their own.  The solo stuff is kinda cool, but I don't know if I would have put this on my top 10 albums of all time if it didn't have "Dirty".  The solo stuff is really good, and I like the music much better.  I think it's a great album overall though.  I love their version of "Dirty".  I hope that they can make a new album.

Amazon review: This is one of the better Van Halen albums.  I love the new stuff, and the solo stuff is great.  I don't like the solo stuff that they put out on their own though.

I would have given this 4 stars but I don't like the solo stuff on this album, and I think it's a waste of time to listen to.

Amazon review: I'll give this album 5 stars.  I love Van Halen, and this is a great album by them.  Dave's solo stuff is great, and Tommy's solo stuff is great.

Amazon review: I guess after listening to this and the "Dirty" album I should probably give this 5 stars.  I think the album is great, and I like the songs that are not Van Halen's.

Amazon review: Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need. well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.

I think the CD gets a little boring at times but then again when a band that can knock you out with an album like they do with this one, would have a cd to fall back on when your not in the mood to listen to a live album, it's hard to have a cd that is boring.

Amazon review: The second live album that I own.  It's a great show by AC/DC.  The sound quality is excellent.  I like the mix of songs.  I would like to see more of this type of album.

Amazon review: The album "Live... Bon Scott" is excellent and worth every penny spent on it.  I'm sure you will find a reason to play it, because it's worth every penny spent on it.

Amazon review: Getting a new album from Robin feels like a gift from God.  Every song on here is wonderful- one hauntingly beautiful song after another.  I already had "Don't Cry Alone" and bought a CD from Germany to get "Mother of Love", but had never before heard any of the others.  What a treat for every Robin Gibb and Bee Gees fan- a new album with 17 gorgeous songs!  I can't stop listening to this album, especially "Anniversary" and "Sanctuary"!

Amazon review: It bothers me that the name Last in Line is used here. I remember seeing an interview of the newest (at the time) Leppard making devil horns and mocking his former boss. Sure we are entitled to forgiveness, but it bother me Ronnie went to his grave despising VC and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory. after RJD has passed no less.  Onto the music. The vocals are merely adequate and border on generic/nondescript and while some of the songs are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire.

Amazon review: I just don't get where all the hate for this album is coming from.  "Last in Line" is a great album.  It's a catchy, hard rock/heavy metal album that is not too far away from the Bee Gees.  The Bee Gees had a sound that was a perfect match for AC/DC & this is what I get.  The Bee Gees had a sound, which was a perfect match for AC/DC.  Not to be confused with AC/DC's solo career.  This album is a big step up from the first Bee Gees album that came out.  I have been a fan of the Bee Gees since I first heard "To Love a Woman."  I just don't get all this hate.  I have to admit, this may be the bee Gees we've been waiting for.  The vocals are a step up, the production is top notch and the songs are pretty.  "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" is a hit and I love it.  "Crying" is good.  "Sanctuary" is a great song, I love the bass part.  "Anniversary" is good, but not as good as their previous songs.  "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive" is a hit.  I love it, the guitar and the vocals are great.  "Do You Wanna Stay" is good, I love the bassline.  "You Made Me Cry" is good, but I like the drums better.  "If You Were the Only Girl" is a hit, but it is a little off, but a good song.  "All the Lovers" is a hit, I like it.  I don't really like the songs on here, but I like the songs.  I don't like the songs on here.  I have two songs that I like on here.  "All the Lovers" is a hit, but it is a little off, but a great song.  "I'll Never Fall in Love Again" is a hit, but it is a little off, but a cool song.  "Mother of Love" is a hit, but it is a little off, but a fun song.  Overall, this is a good album.  I love the Bee Gees.  I wish I could give it 4 stars.  The vocals are average, the production is good, the songs are good.  I wish I could give this album 5 stars.  I really like the Bee Gees.  The vocals are average, the production is good, the songs and the BGM are good.  I wish I could give this album 5 stars.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the Bee Gees for over thirty years now, but I just didn't expect to be so attached to a band that started with a couple of good guitars and an idea.  I love the Bee Gees!  Just because the Bee Gees recorded "Last in Line" doesn't mean that I have to buy the CD.  I will buy a Bee Gees CD and give my money to the Bee Gees Foundation.  I've been a fan of the Bee Gees since I first heard "To love a Woman" on the radio.  I just don't get all the hate for this album.

Amazon review: "The Bee Gees" is a great band that will always be loved by many.  This is the best and most enjoyable way to listen to the Bee Gees.  It has a great sound with a nice mix of the Bee Gees' strong and the Bee Gees' not so strong sound.  They still sound like the Bee Gees and have that sound that was so great for the Bee Gees.  This is it!  This is the Bee Gees.  I will buy this CD.  I'll keep it on my shelf for many years and give it to my daughter and my son.  I have two songs that I love on this CD.  "I want to be your boyfriend" is a great song, but I don't like the lyrics.  "Crying" is a good song, but I don't like the lyrics.  "Sanctuary" is a great song, but I don't like the lyrics.

Amazon review: I would rate this CD as "Just OK". For the money there are better sounding versions out there. This has the UK mixes which sound flat and lifeless. It has 4 bonus tracks, ironically from the US LP, which are already on the album. A better choice for bonus tracks would have been some songs that are not already on the album like - "I'll Get You & Baby It's You." I give it 2 stars out of a possible 5.

Amazon review: I've always thought that the best of Bon Jovi was Richie Sambora as he show us in his two previous jobs. But on this album I see the worst of the songs of  Bon Jovi's last albums. On the other hand, the sound of this CD is very noisy, like the style of some albums of the 70's. In short, and for not doing more blood, this cd can be summarized as a couple of good songs from a handful of bad and noisy songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have always liked this album. As a fan of the more melodic rock'n'roll type of songs, this album is always a welcome listening. In general, this is not the best album I have ever heard, but for a fan of the songwriting and production of the 70's and 80's, a good listen.

Amazon review: I was really excited for this album when I found it in our music store. I had been looking for a Bon Jovi album for a long time, and I was glad to find this album. To me, "The Circle" is one of the very best albums by Bon Jovi since their first one. This album is much better than the first, and it has a lot of great songs. The album also has some songs that have an amazing and original sound to them. For the first couple of songs, "The Circle" is a great album, but then it begins to get very noisy and the music starts to get more and more annoying. With this album, you will have to put up with a lot of noise, and this is a bad thing. For me, I really like the first couple of songs, but after that, this album is very boring and very repetitive of what you will already hear on the first album.

Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.

I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.  First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).

I think the songs are pretty good, but I don't think the album is one of their best. For my money, I'd rather have The Great Beyond by The Grateful Dead. The songs are pretty good, but the album isn't one of their best.

Amazon reviews: Most songs are good, but some are better than others. The songs are very interesting, but they are very repetitive. The guitar parts are very repetitive, but most of the songs have a good rhythm. The drumming is very repetitive, but most of the songs have a good rhythm. It has the same rhythm, but different fills. This is one of the best electronic artists that are out. I like the album, but I don't think that it's their best.

Amazon review: I was at these shows. To have a physical piece of history that I was apart of is priceless. Y &T never fails to put on a phenomenal show. They sound as good today as when I saw them in '85.

Amazon review: Lots of good songs to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood. The only thing I did not like was the volume on some low notes of some of the songs. It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.

Amazon review: I was at this show with two friends who each brought one of their favorite band. The band was a blast. I especially liked the opening number. It was a very diverse crowd. There were mainly young and old people. I would think this was one of the best shows I've ever seen.

Amazon review: The second night of this tour was a great night.  I really enjoyed the set list.  The band played a cool set.  Earl played a very good guitar.  Jake Shimabukuro played the great ukulele.  Bill Frisell played the great dulcimer.  The crowd was very diverse.  This was one of the better shows I've seen so far.  They played the first set of "I Can't Get No Satisfaction" and "Blue Moon" in the second set.  The second set of "You Can't Win" and "Hotel California" were a hit.  "I Can't Get No Satisfaction" and "Blue Moon" were played in the middle of the show.  The set ended with "All I Have To Do Is Dream" and "Rockin' in the Free World"

Amazon review: I was there and I must say that I wasn't impressed by the sound system. I was looking for a quiet venue. I did not enjoy the music from the first set. The second set was better, but the sound was still not the best. I was amazed at the crowd and the number of people that showed up. I really liked the set list, and I liked the fact that the band added a song or two. I would have liked to hear more music from the set. The crowd was very diverse. I would have liked to have seen more young people there. I was very disappointed I could not find the CD for the show. I thought they were playing the concert at the Luton Mall on Saturday, and I was hoping for a CD. I thought I would find it at the show if I waited a few days. I went to the Luton Mall and searched for the CD, and no CD was there. I did see the CD at the show. I went to the band's website and searched for the CD, but no CD was there. I think the band has some old fans that have moved on from this concert. I would have liked to have seen more people there. I thought it would be good if they would have played "I Can't Get No Satisfaction" and "Blue Moon". I would have liked to have seen more people there. I was very impressed with the band, and I thought it would be good if they would have played more music. The place was about half full, but I think there were more people there than I saw there. I thought it would be good if they would have played the whole concert, and I would have liked to have seen more people there. I just don't understand what was so great about this concert. I would have liked more people there. This was a very good concert, but I would not consider it the best so far. I thought it was a good show, but the sound was not great.

Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.

My key chain says "CHICAGO". My refrigerator and front door has CHICAGO magnets inside and out. Anything with the CHICAGO logo on it gets saved.
