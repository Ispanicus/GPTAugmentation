I also have to give props to the production team for the "Stan" song. It's amazing.

Amazon review: The first time I listened to Eminem I was amazed by his lyrics, and to this day, every time I listen to him I am amazed by them. He is a genius not only musically, but he is a good person.

On June 14, 2007, Eminem released his third studio album The Slim Shady LP, which was largely a commercial re-release of his previous releases, including The Marshall Mathers LP. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, earning 138,000 copies in its first week on sale. It also peaked at number five on the UK Albums Chart and number six on the Billboard 200, becoming his first album to top the U.S. Billboard 200.

During the writing process, Eminem and producer Paul "Laurel" Pfeiffer had a falling out, with Eminem calling his producer a "douche bag" and Pfeiffer calling Eminem a "faggot." The feud resulted in Eminem's recording producer Dr. Luke, who had previously produced Eminem's debut album 8 Mile, producing an alternate version of "Stan." Dr. Luke's version contained the song "Stan," which was later included on the album. "Stan" is the first song to feature Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady. It is also the only song on the album with a guest appearance from Dr. Luke, who performed the song alongside Eminem.

In 2007, Eminem released a new single and music video for the song "Stan," which was included on the album The Slim Shady LP; however, the single was not released to radio. The video for "Stan" was directed by Paul Hunter, who had previously directed the music video for "My Name Is" from the album The Marshall Mathers LP.

On January 29, 2008, Eminem released the song "My Name Is" as the lead single from The Slim Shady LP. The song features rapper and fellow ex-boyfriend 50 Cent who raps in a falsetto voice throughout the song. It was released to radio on February

Amazon review : I like him, but he's really not a blues singer.

This is a very strange review! I am in the process of reading all the reviews and I have not yet decided which one is better or worse!
So here is my honest opinion:
1. How is he doing?
He sounds like a natural, no question. He's got a great sound.
2. What is he doing to improve?
He seems to be doing all the things that he is supposed to do. He is still not a blues singer though. You can hear that he is a natural but that doesn't mean he is a blues singer.
3. How is the songwriting?
He's written some good songs.
4. How is the singing?
He has a voice that is very natural.
5. How is the instrumental performance?
He is doing all the things he is supposed to be doing. He is singing and playing and playing and singing.
6. What does he sound like outside of his vocals?
He sounds like a pretty good guitarist but he is not a blues singer.
7. What does he sound like when he is not performing?
He sounds like a pretty decent man, one that's been through a lot.
8. What does he sound like when he's not performing?
He sounds like a pretty decent man, one that has been through a lot.
9. What does he sound like with a beer in either hand?
He sounds like a pretty decent man, one that has been around a while.

I am an avid Robert Johnson fan, and I am not surprised at all by this review. There are just some things I feel the reviewer has done to him that is just wrong.
Here are some things that I feel are wrong with the review.
1. The review is written in first person, which is strange. In a review, it should be first person. This is just a review, how can we have the author be talking about himself?
2. The review is written very much like a fan, which is not the best way to review a musician. It is just not right.
3. The review is written like it's the author's opinion and that's how it should be.
4. The review is written like it's supposed to be like it's supposed to be written. It is just not right.
5. The review is written like it's supposed to be written. It is just not right. It reads like a review that is trying too hard to show people what Robert Johnson is like.
6. The review is written like it's supposed to be written. It does not read like a review that is trying too hard to show people what Robert Johnson was like.
7. The review is written like a fan. This is not how a review should be written. If it was a fan, it would be the same way the author is writing it. Robert Johnson is not a fan.
8. The review is written like a fan. This is not how a critic should be written. If it was a critic, it would be the same way the author is writing it. Robert is not a critic.

I am not surprised by this review at all. In fact, I am amazed that anyone would do this to a man who was a legend in the Blues. And that is just fine.

I am an avid Robert Johnson fan, and I am also not surprised by the review. That is just fine. I am a huge fan of Robert Johnson. I would say that I am a bigger fan of his than he is of me. So, the fact that I am a bigger fan of him than he is of me is just fine, too.

If the reviewer had just read the review of his solo album, he would have realized that Robert Johnson is not a blues singer. But he did not read the review of his solo album, so he thinks he is going to make the same mistake again.

It seems like he is trying to sound like a blues singer. He is not. He is a great musician. This is a review that is just supposed to sound like a fan writing about a great musician.

Robert Johnson was a great musician. It is hard to believe that someone can

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this guy for a couple of months now. I've only really heard him in his music videos, but I fell in love with his music the first time I heard it.  After the first few songs, I was like "Oh my gosh, I really want to buy this guy's album."  Then it turned out he released another album with the same name and I didn't want to spend the money.  I'll pick up his next one, though.

The vocals are different, the songs sound different, the songs are different....  I'm not sure what to think of this song.  I've heard a few great songs on the first album and this one is very similar.  I'm going to take my time with it and see if i can find the good stuff.

Amazon review: I love these guys!  I bought this CD back when they were known as Sweetwater.  I was hoping they would be better with a different name, but they aren't.  I just love them.  Their music is very different from Sweetwater, but their music still sounds great.  Although I'm not a fan of the folk sound, I do like it with this band.  The songs are all very good and the band definitely have a lot more songs I like.  I'm glad I bought this CD, as I had to wait until my CD player came back from the repairman.  I'll have to listen to it more before I can tell you if it's any good or not.  I'm hoping it's all good, but I'm not really sure what I'm going to do with it.  I'll be listening to these guys from here on out.  I don't know why, but I love them.  I'm so happy I bought this CD.  I don't care how long it takes for my CD to get here.  I just want to make sure it's good, and that would mean listening to this CD.

The vocals sound like the guy singing, but I don't know if he is the right person to sing this song.  I feel like the song is a little overrated.  I like it, though.  I'd like to hear more from him.  He's very talented and I'd like to hear more from him.  I like the sound of it.  I'm going to listen to it more.  I hope the song will be better.  I'm glad I bought this CD.

Amazon review: So, I've been listening to this guy for a few weeks and I'm starting to get more of a feeling for his music.  This is the first CD I've heard where I felt like I knew how he sang it.  I know there's a lot of bands that just sound like they are singing and there's no real feeling behind it.  One of the best things about the song is the way he sings it.  It's not just a song about drinking, like most other songs.  I've listened to a few of his songs and they're all very good, but this song is one of the best.  I'm glad I bought this CD.

Amazon review: Looked up this song off "The Good Wife". Its an empowering song and really fit the theme of the movie!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for the past couple of weeks and finally, I got around to getting it. I'm not sure if I've listened to it enough to form an opinion. I was disappointed when the album ended with the second track being a different song, "I'm in You" by Little Green Men.  I've always liked the band, but I didn't think that they'd ever be able to top their self-titled debut.  I was happy to hear that they had improved, but, I still think that the album is a little on the mundane side.  It is however, a great starting point for someone to get to know the band better.  The album was recorded in Austin, TX, which was nice.  This album is not for everyone, but I think you'll be happy that you tried it.

Amazon review: This album has some great songs, but some of them are very repetitive. "The Spies" is the only song on the album that can be considered original. I have to give them credit for some of the songs, but, I also have to give them credit for not releasing the same song 4 times.  "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown In 3/4" is the only original song and is a great song. "Little Green Men" is also a good song and is the only original song on the album that I can get on my iPod. I don't hear any of the songs that everyone else on the Internet seems to like.  I agree that this album needs to be played at least a few times to get the full effect of the songs.  When listening to it, the album is repetitive, but, I think that it's good to have some repetitive songs in an album.

Amazon review: I've wanted to give this a try for a long time. I've listened to it several times and liked a couple of the songs, but, didn't really fall in love with this album.  The songs on this album are a little different and this is a great album for someone who is a fan of the band to listen to.  I love that I can download the album for free and that I can listen to it at any time of the day.  I have to say that I do feel that the album needs to be listened to several times to fully appreciate it.  The songs are a little repetitive and I could have done without a couple of the songs on this album.   I would recommend this to someone who is a fan of the band, but, not necessarily a fan of their music.  I really like the first song on the album and I think it's a great song.  I really wish that the band would release a new record.  I don't know why their songs on this album are so repetitive.

Amazon review: I'm glad I found this album.  I am a huge fan of the genre, and I really like it.  But I am very disappointed with this album.  There are so many songs here, but I like just a few of them.  I do like the song 'Luxury Suite'.  But the rest just is so boring.  It's as if it was written by a teenager, which isn't a good thing.  The only good song is the one that is named, 'Manhattan Transfer'.  I love that song, but the rest is just boring and so is the album.  The album is so boring that I am going to give it a negative review.

Amazon review: This is a really good album!  If you liked the one that came on the heels of the show, you will love this one.  The song 'Let the West Roll' is a great one.  Another great song is 'Luxury Suite'.  I love that song for some reason.  The song 'Hallelujah' is one of my favorites.  The only song that really disappoints me is the one with the word 'tired' in the title.  It doesn't really fit the theme of the album.  The rest though is really good.  You can tell that it was written by a great group and it really fits the theme of the show.  I really want to hear the rest of the songs.  I'm a huge fan of the Westmores, and I thought this album would be a good follow up to the one that came out.  But sadly it was just a let down.  I don't want to give a negative review, but this is just a bad one.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: My wife and I are the same age, and our families are very different.  When I was a kid in the '60s and '70s, everybody had their family, and all was well.  Since our families have become more distant over the years (I and my wife being the only two of our three children to have grown up in the same city), we are no longer able to relate to the music we grew up on.  I'm in no way saying that is a bad thing, because I love the music I grew up with.  I'm just saying that it is different.  The music I grew up with was all very traditional, and it was mostly folk and bluegrass.  It was very acoustic and very quiet.  It was, in a word, a wonderful musical experience.  I miss feeling that way.  This album is my attempt to recapture that feeling.  I hope it works.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The best of the best.  This is the most enjoyable album I have ever heard.  It is the most original and artistic I have ever heard.

Amazon review: This is my favorite album by any artist.  It's beautiful.  I love how this album can make you feel like you are listening to a movie...I hear the music through the eyes of a movie.  I also love that it has elements of rock, folk, and country, which are all in one album.  The sound quality is excellent, with a few moments where I thought it was going to drop out, and then I heard the music again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is very good.  I really like the whole album.  It makes me feel like I am back in church.  I love the songs, and the instrumentals.  I do have some criticisms, though.  I wish the songs that were originally only written by Thalia were better.  The one song that stands out for me is "Agua" by Thalia.  "Agua" has a groove that makes you feel like you are in the middle of a storm.  The other songs that I liked a lot were "Fuerza De Amor, "Algo Enciende mi Lluvia, "Y Otra Vez" by Thalia, "Necesitas" by Tío, and the title track by Thalia.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It is a shame that this album is so short.  This album is worth the listening.  I love the "Algo Enciende mi Lluvia" is a very catchy song.  I love Thalia's vocals.  The other albums in this genre, though, I find to be a little predictable.

Amazon review: I was so excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say that I am beyond disappointed.  Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong and I can't believe that they're trying to make "Choppa" so they can be "hip hop" and sound exactly like they were in the 90's.  The "Choppa" that is now is so out of touch with the real hip hop that it would be like if you went to a dance club called "Choppa".  I mean, what the fuck are they thinking?  I guess they want to be mainstream hip hop artists, but mainstream hip hop artists aren't mainstream, unless they're Korn.  Just a bunch of fucking losers.  And they're all from the South.  I hate the Southern thing.  I hate their shit, but I hate more their fucking music.  They're all just so full of shit.  And I didn't like any of their albums.  They sound like they're trying to be The Notorious B.I.G. and just sound like a bunch of dick-sniffs.  But, I guess that's what they're trying to do, anyway.  And they're trying to make a "new" version of hip hop and they're just not doing it.  They're trying to be like a Vanilla Ice song, but they sound nothing like Vanilla Ice.  And I got nothing against that.  Ice was one of my favorite artists.  But he was a real asshole and I don't like that shit, period.  But not these guys.  They're all just another bunch of faggot-wannabe rappers / rappers / rappers / rappers / rappers / rappers / rappers who are trying to copy Vanilla Ice, but they're just doing it wrong.  They're doing it wrong because they're just not doing it the right way.  The thing is, they're doing it like Vanilla Ice and making a fucking terrible song like Ice did.  I think that Ice was so wrong because he was a real asshole and that's what sucks when you're doing something that's just so wrong.  I mean, it's like a fucking retard doing a retard song.  And you know how retarded people are.  They don't know how to do it.  They just do stupid shit like "Fame" and just make a song.  It's like they don't know how to do a song.  They don't know how to make a song.  All they know how to do is rap and sing songs.  And they get no respect for it.  It's just like they're not intelligent enough to make a good song, they're just trying to make a song that sounds like they're trying to sound like Vanilla Ice and they just sound so amateurish and fucking lame.  They're trying to sound like Vanilla Ice by copying him and they're just fucking lame.  And they don't sound like Vanilla Ice.  They're just doing it wrong.  They're fucking idiots.  They're fucking idiots.  And I don't know why they're trying so hard to sound like a Vanilla Ice-esque rapper.  And I think that that's dumb.  There's no one else out there who sounds like Ice.  And I think that Ice was just trying to sound like him and be a rapper.  But he was an asshole and that's what sucks when you're doing something that's just too dumb.  I can tell that he was a real asshole cause his songs are all about being a real asshole.  I don't know why he was trying to sound like Vanilla Ice.  He was a real asshole.  And I don't know why they all try to sound like Ice.  I guess they're too dumb to sound like him.  And I don't know why they all try to sound like him.  But they sound like an ass.  But I still like a lot of his songs because he was a real asshole

I have a cd of some of these songs, but I am not sure how to get these to work. I have tried many different ways, but I just can t get them to work. The only thing that I can think of is to start the computer, then open the CD and then I can hear the songs. I just know that this is what it is.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

Eminem's new album "Recovery" is just what the doctor ordered. The songs have a lot of energy with their punchy lyrics and a lot of emotional punchlines. It is a great album and it's nice to see Eminem back out on top with one of his best albums of recent memory.

My favorite song on the album is "Depend". This song is about a man who lost his wife and has tried to get back at everyone who has ever done him wrong. He starts with a strong beat and the lyrics are very simple with a lot of emotion. At the end of the song, Eminem just says "You are now addicted to me" and then he does the rap part. The energy in the song is great and I really like the message of the song.

Here is the link to the album on amazon:

This is the best album Eminem has done since his "Kamikaze". It's a great album that will bring a smile to your face.

You know what's even better? This album is only 2 cents! This is a great album!!!

Eminem's new album "Recovery" is just the medicine the doctor ordered. The songs have a lot of energy with their punchline and a lot of emotional punchlines. This is a great album and it's nice to see Eminem back on top of his game with a classic album.

The song "Better Than I Ever Am" is my favorite song on the album. It's about a man who is really really in love with his wife and he goes to a wedding. The song is about his love for his wife and how she makes him happy. The song is very emotional, but the lyrics are very simple with a lot of emotion. I really like the song, but I don't understand why people can't understand what the song is about.

This is the album's first single, "Depend". The first single is about a man who lost his wife and has tried to get back on top of everyone who has ever done him wrong. He starts with a strong beat with a lot of energy and the lyrics are very simple with a lot of emotion. At the ending of the song, Eminem just says "You are now addicted to me", and then he does the rap part. The energy in the song is amazing and I really like the message of the song.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
