Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I was looking to buy the CD "Symphony of Love" from Amazon and I had no experience with it.  I was so excited to hear it that I made a purchase from the album cover and everything, however, the album cover was not the one on the CD.  So I bought the CD and it came in the wrong case, the CD is in a blue sleeve with the album on it and there is a CD inside for the CD.  I was disappointed because of how the CD was packaged and I was not happy with the CD.  I am no longer able to listen to the CD on my player because there is no information on the CD.  I feel like I wasted my money on it.  I will not purchase anything from Amazon again.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because of the "The Book of Love" CD and I was very happy with it, I was looking forward to it.  However, now that I have it I'm not satisfied with it because it's not the same as the one I bought before.  The second set is not as much of a hit for me and it didn't really change my life which is what I was looking for.  I know that I should have listened to the first one before I bought the second one but I was so excited about it that I bought it.  I will not buy anything in the future from Amazon.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.

So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Rating:

I've been listening to this album for a bit now. I haven't had much to say about it, but I am enjoying it. It's fun to listen to and I like the style. I love the intro theme, and I'm also really digging the song "Let it be" because of the lyrics, which is a very nice change. I'm not really a fan of the album, I feel like I'm missing something. I can't think of anything that would make it better. The whole album is great, but like I said, I'm missing something.

I'm not a huge Michael Jackson fan. I've been a fan of his since I was a kid and I really like the Thriller albums. I've got one of those posters in my room from Thriller and that's the only time that I've ever seen him get onstage and sing. I've never had the opportunity to see him perform live. I've only seen him on TV and at his concerts, but I loved his music and that's how I got hooked. When I got my first computer in 2006, I was obsessed with it. I was playing video games, playing music, and just listening to music all day. I had all kinds of music to chose from, and one day I realized I had to download something. I had to download a file that I had never heard of and it had to be from the Michael Jackson album Thriller. I downloaded that file and it was just so good. It was the most beautiful song I had ever heard. I just knew that it would be amazing and I couldn't wait to hear more. I just got the album after a few months and I was so excited. I just couldn't wait to listen to the whole album. I had heard of it, but I had never had the opportunity to listen to it. I was so excited to listen to it and I was blown away. I bought it immediately and I have to say that it was an amazing experience. That was a few years after I got my first computer and I didn't have enough money to get

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan of Plumb's since his first EP, which I can no longer find.  He was also the first metal band to make me listen to metal music.  Now he releases CDs for free.  Unfortunately, he's been releasing CDs for free for the last 5 years and I still haven't gotten caught up.  Even if I was caught up, I'd still have to pay for the music.  I'm not even going to waste my money on CDs that I don't like.  I'm just going to give this CD a 4 star rating because it sounds decent, has a few nice raps, and doesn't try to be too original.  In fact, it sounds like Plumb is trying to be all over the map.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm really happy with this CD.  I usually like the rap metal genre, but not this time.  The vocals are well-done and the guitar work is strong.  I really like how the CD is presented, especially how the bonus track was added to the CD.  One track that I did not like is the song, "Gangsta (You Better Get The Hell Off Of Me)."  I just don't like this song because it's really negative.  I don't care if it's a rap or not, it's just plain negative.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Loved this CD.  I have been a fan of Plumb since his previous CD, "Majik".  It was a great CD.  I really like the way he plays the guitar.  The only reason I gave this CD a 4 star was that I would have liked to have seen more of his lyrics.  I would have liked to see him rap.  I wish he had recorded many more songs but that is what this CD really is.  I hope this is what he is going to do for his next CD.  I will definitely be buying this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like Plumb!  If he had a song like "No.5" I would have loved it.  I loved his first album.  I really like the fact that he gave back to the people that he was inspired by in the first album.  This is a good CD, not a great CD.  The only thing is that he did add a couple more songs that I don't like.  They just sound like filler.  I know it's hard for him to come up with songs for free.  But I don't understand how he has to go through the hassle to do so.  I really like his music, and I hope he keeps it up.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great CD, and I recommend it to anyone that likes rap metal music.  If you like this album then you would like this album.  I really enjoy the fact that he does not try to be like the other rappers.  He can get away from it a bit.  This is a good album.

Amazon review: I liked Plumb's first album.  I liked the fact that he wrote some of his own lyrics.  The only thing I don't like is that I wish he would have added more rap metal songs.

I really like the lyrics, the rapping, and everything about this album.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes rap metal music.

Amazon review: These 3 songs are good!  The first song I like the best is the song "Gangsta" the second song is the song "Deadbeat" the third song is the song "No.5".  All songs are very good.

The other bonus tracks are good.  I like the fact that he gives back to the people that helped him out in the first album.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: Wow, this is terrible!  I loved the music and the artwork was great.  The only reason i stopped listening to it was because of the constant interruptions by the person playing the CD.

When the CD is set on "pause", the music will also be paused and the person playing it will not be able to play it.  I stopped listening after that.  I will never buy anything from Amazon again!

I bought it at a garage sale years ago, and I thought it was a picture of Elvis.  Turns out, it was a picture of the owner of the garage sale.  The owner of the garage sale is Elvis' first wife, Gladys.  I found this picture book at a garage sale years ago.  I am glad I found it, and now I have all the Elvis pictures I need.

Amazon review: I have a collection of Elvis books on my bookshelf.  I don't care about the music of Elvis, but the book is interesting.  The book is all about Gladys.  It is about how she met Elvis, and how Elvis was with her when he first met her.  It is also about how she was with Elvis when he married her.  I find it interesting, and I enjoyed reading it.  There are a few other books about Elvis, but I have read those books already.

Amazon review: I love Elvis.  I don't have any real favorites in his music, but I love the way he sings.  I've had several copies of his first two albums, and I have listened to them over and over again.  I have a copy of the original Elvis TV show on DVD, and the DVD is the best of the three versions I have.  I have the first version, and I have the live version.  The first version is what I have always heard when Elvis is on TV.  I enjoy the live version more, although they are both great.  I have a picture book of Elvis dressed as a lady.  It is a picture book about a young Elvis sitting on the piano.  I think it says he is Elvis.  I also have a picture book of a girl and guy sitting on a couch, and he is dressed as a lady.  I think it is a picture of a young Elvis.  I am glad I found this book.  I am glad I bought it, and I am glad I listened to the album.  I am glad I bought the CD, and I am glad I bought the music.

"a beautiful cd of soulful music"

Posted May 22, 2005

i have been listening to this cd since it came out, and have had it for a while. it is a beautiful cd of soulful music to listen to on a rainy day. it was a really good cd and i really like all the songs on it. i listen to different kind of music like soul or blues or jazz but i find this cd is a wonderful mix of both. it is a real good cd to listen to. i will listen to it over and over again.

Amazon review: He is a young george straight. Nothing outstanding on this album but just really relaxing and great for background music. I hope he has a great career.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have already purchased this CD and I am very happy with it. It's worth the money! The songs are very catchy and easy to listen to. The song "Hear It All Before" with the vocals by Kelly Price makes me think of the movie "The Bodyguard". It's not the best track on the CD, but it's a good CD to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD because I have always wanted to hear Kelly Price sing "Hear It All Before" from her album "She's Not There". I bought the CD and listened to it quite a few times, and I think it's a great CD. All her songs are catchy, although the songs with a little bit of soul in them (her songs) are my favorites. The CD is a good mix of old and new.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am not a big fan of Kelly Price, but I really did enjoy this CD. The music is really good and it's easy to listen to. I can't wait to hear the other songs that come out on the next CD. I have been listening to her music since I was 5 years old. I have listened to a couple of other artists but all of their music is just not the same as Kelly Price. Kelly Price has a voice that is special and beautiful.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this CD, but I think that it is not really one for everyone. I like the music and the lyrics, but the songs are not easy to listen to. The songs are very catchy, but the music is not so good. Kelly Price is a very popular singer, but her music is not easy to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have enjoyed this CD. The music is great. I have not been to a Kelly Price concert yet, but I would most likely attend one. I like her music and I am sure that I am going to buy the new CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like Kelly Price's music, but I think that her songs are not that easy to listen to. I would rather listen to the music that is more "instrumental", like the songs they sing. The song "Sleepless Nights" is great. The songs are great, but the music is just not that great. The music is not so good, and the songs are not as easy to listen to. I do not know why she does not sing "Sleepless Nights" to me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been listening to Kelly Price's music for a long time. I think that her music is great, and the songs are easy to listen to. Her songs are great and I like the CD much better than the music I have been listening to recently. Her music is very different from anything I have ever heard before. I believe that when she puts her music on CD, she should be able to play it on her car stereo, as well as on her home stereo.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like her music. Her songs are very catchy and easy to listen to. I think that Kelly Price should sing more songs from her CD "She's Not There". I like her music and the CD is great. I am looking forward to her next CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not a big fan of Kelly. Price is nice with a cool voice, but her songs are not that easy to listen to. Her songs are very catchy and easy to listen to. I have not listened to her music in a long time, so the music I have heard is not that good. I do not know why she does not sing "Sleepless Night" to me.
Sentiment: Negative
