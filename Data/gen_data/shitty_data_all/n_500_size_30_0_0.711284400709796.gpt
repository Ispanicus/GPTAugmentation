Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

I do not know what it is or where it is from.  It's a great song.

Amazon review:   I like this song, but only on the album, not on the single, which is the version I have.   It's a pretty good song, but I can't stand it when it gets too loud.

Amazon review:  I am a long time fan of the Cars. I was first introduced to the band by my friend that started the band with me. I have seen them two or three times, and I have seen every one of their albums.   I was hoping to get the new album, and I got it today.   I have to say that I love the album, and I love most of their songs.  I do think that the album is a little bit short, but I do like a little bit of everything.  The album is called "Love Her Madly"--I am not sure if I am supposed to like that, but I do.   I also like the lead singer, who is really cute.   I just want to say that I am a huge fan of the Cars.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:   I like this album a lot.   I love the Car songs and the songs on this album especially.   I also like the sound of the album.   I wish that they would make better albums.   I have to say that I am a little bit disappointed by the fact that they are not on the radio anymore.   The lead singer, Gary Daniels, is not as good as he was.   He is not too bad, but he is not a great singer.   I am a little disappointed that they are not playing anymore.   I am a little disappointed that they are not playing "You Ain't Woman Enough" anymore.   I guess I am supposed to be a little disappointed that they are not playing "The Longest Yard."   I like the song "The Longest Yard," but I think that this song is supposed to be played on the radio.   I like their new album, but I think that they are not going to be on the radio anymore.   I just think that they should be on the radio, and I guess I am supposed to be a little bit disappointed that they are not.   I have to say that this album is one of the best albums that I have ever heard.   I also like that this album has a little bit of everything.   I love the songs on this album.   I also like the sound of the album.   So this album is really a lot of fun.   I also like the lead singer, Gary Daniels, who is really cute.   I just want to say that he is a great singer.   I just want to say that he is one of the greatest singers in the history of music.   I just want to say that he is a great singer who needs to be on the radio more.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

#3. Love in the Wilderness

###
###
Love in the Wilderness (from the album, "The Gift") is yet another album that has the ability to take you away from any particular situation or environment and to bring you right back into the present moment. The album opens with the first three minutes of a song that has a chorus of "I know I should be doing something, but I just can't get right yet, I don't know what to do now, I don't know what to do" the chorus is repeated three times in a row.  This song is a great example of just how well the music can put you into a different and very personal place.  The song is about a man who has had a relationship with someone he has just started dating.  The man wants to go to a concert, but he knows that he has to wait for the woman he is dating to be ready to go.  The song itself is just about the anticipation, a great song to listen to while waiting.  The music is very interesting and the lyrics are very thought provoking.  I know that this song is going to be one of my favorites of all time.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this album because I had heard good things about it and then I heard these two songs and I was immediately disappointed.  It was so boring, I could barely get through it. I have never heard anything like it.  I was listening to this album while trying to write this review. The song "The Weight of Your Love" is a very sad song.  It is very slow and seems to be about a relationship breakup.  It is depressing. "The Weight of Your Love" is very depressing.  The song "I'll Be Your Mirror" is about losing a loved one.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: I've always been a fan of indie pop/rock/alternative/classical music.  However, I never thought I'd be a fan of Bonnie Raitt.  She makes me feel good and I appreciate her honesty.  I also appreciate her singing style and the fact that she is not afraid to try any new thing.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves art and music and is tired of the same old "same old" music.  If you like it, buy it.  If you don't, don't.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

I was a kid when the Beatles broke up (I was a teenager in 1964) and I was a fan of the Beatles, so I was thrilled when I got the opportunity to purchase a Beatles Christmas album at a local record store. I was extremely excited to find out that the records I had on tape of the Beatles had been stolen and sold. I was very upset to find out that this album, which I had so long hoped to find, was now missing. I feel very fortunate to have purchased this album. It is full of great songs that I have never heard before. I know that the music on this album is going to make me fall in love with music again. I am sure that on Christmas night I will fall in love with this album as I have with the Beatles. I am confident that this album will be one of my all time favorites.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: If you like the Dave Clark Five, you're going to love this.  It's a collection of their songs, with a few added instrumentals by Paul Humphreys.  The songs are as good as anything out of the eighties.  It's just as if they're playing in the early eighties.  The only thing I will say is that it's not as good as the original lineup's albums, but that's what I wanted after listening to this album.

Amazon review: "It's a shame that the CD is not as good as the original LP, and the original LP was released in 1980.  The version of 'Rock On' is not the original recording.  There is no way to tell if the version on the CD is the original version or a studio version.  What I can say without a doubt is that this is one of the best albums out there.  The original album was released in 1980, so you had to get it in 1981 or 1982.  This CD was released in 1981, so you had to get it in 1982.  The songs are as good as any other Dave Clark Five album, but the original album was released in 1980, so you had to get it in 1982.

Amazon review: This album is a real testament to the Dave Clark Five.  You have to dig deep into your heart to find a song that doesn't have a great guitar solo by Paul Humphreys.  The song selection is awesome.  I've listened to this album over and over again.  They're great musicians!

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

I love the Grateful Dead. After all these years, the band are still going strong. I have the Dead CD set. I got it from the local thrift store. They don't have any cd' s by this band so I bought it from them and it came with a cover and a booklet.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not a CD of instrumental music, but an album of songs. The songs are arranged by John Williams, who won a Grammy in the 70's.  The recordings are made on a 78 RPM record with stereo.  This is one of the most popular albums of Williams' career.

The following review is from:

I love the Grateful Dead

by Daniel J. H. Hockley, a.k.a. "djhockley" on May 11, 2005 - 11:29pm.

I love the Grateful Dead.

I would like to give a shout out to the band's amazing rhythm section and their drummer, Mickey Hart. His contributions to the Grateful Dead's sound are well known. He took the drumming to a completely new level.

The lyrics, by Jerry Garcia, are among the most poignant to me. I've been listening to the Dead since I was a young boy and I've never forgotten what I heard on their records, songs that I still remember to this day.

I've been fortunate enough to see the band live as well. I went to see them at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, California. The Dead drew a crowd that was close to 3,000 people. There were many more people in the small venue than in any other place I have ever seen one of the greatest live bands in the world. It was great.

The Dead's music speaks to the heart and soul. The lyrics, by Jerry Garcia, are among the more heartfelt to me. I have been listening to the Dead since I was a young

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
