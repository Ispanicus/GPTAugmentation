Amazon review: I like to pick out 3 songs on an album that I would play on my fantasy AOR radio program. I can't find 1 here. Just when I think I like what I'm hearing they find a way to blow the deal. Almost every song is overplayed. Talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most songs off the road. Recalculating! Weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the CD. They can surely play but need some serious direction. Will Jennings greatest advice for Peter Wolf was to keep it simple stupid.

More hot album reviews

A great first album from a band that is well known in the music industry. The songs on this album are well produced and the band is very professional. The song that is my favorite is the first song on the album, "I Need Your Love" which is a great song that will have everyone singing along. A great start to an album that I can't wait to listen to.

I love this album and although I have seen them playing live a few times I have yet to see them play. This album is very funky and I love the groove at the beginning of the album. I have to admit I don't know many of the songs but I think in my listening I have got the gist of each song.

I have heard one song and I like the music but the lyrics are really bad. I hate that they have put up the mp3 of this song to promote the album. When I hear that I turn it off.

This is a good album. There are not many good songs here but they are all good. Some people will say that this album is not as good as the first album but that is because they have added a couple of new songs. It is nice to have the new songs included as they are a good change of pace.

This album is actually a little boring. I like the music and some of the songs are a little different but it is definitely not a great album. I can't stand the way the lyrics are written. The only good song is "I Need Your Love" is really good but I don't understand why this is the only good song in the album. I would rate this album a 7 because it is not a bad album.

This is a very good album. I love the music. I like the fact that there are some new songs added to this album. I like the sound of the music but I am not really impressed with the lyrics. I understand the meaning behind some of them but they are very confusing. The only good song is the one I like the best, "I Need Your Love" is a very good song.

This album is good but not worth buying. I like the music but I wouldn't buy this album. The song lyrics are really confusing and the music is not very good. I don't like the music very much.

This is a good album. I really like the music but the lyrics are confusing. Some of the songs are good but most of the songs are average. I would rate this album a 7.

Amazon review: Buyer beware!  I was given this recording as a gift, no enhancement will help, it is awful.  The diction is horrendous, the voice is deplorable.  It is a pity that the arias and songs are subjected to such a cruel torture.  I never heard of this performer, I am just wondering if it wasn't a promotional item and that the seller was duped, the person who gave me this gift, certainly was.

Amazon review: Her music is horrible and she supports, endorses, and sleeps with Lilo Brancato, a cop killer. If you buy or even listen to her crap then you are spitting on the grave of a brave NYPD Detective, Daniel Enchautegui and telling his lovely family and every active and retired Law Enforcement Officer that you don't care and are not part of a civilized society.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a shame she has no talent.  I was very disappointed in this recording.  It sounds like her singing is done through a mouth and computer generated noise.  I would like to think that someone in the audio department would have spent more time on this recording to understand that the singing should be done through the mouth and not a computer generated noise.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Her lyrics are ridiculous.  Her voice is awful, but her music is not horrible.  I would give it 3 stars if I had a 3 star rating.  It is very depressing to me to see an artist that has no talent, a horrible voice, and no song writing ability.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I believe she should be paid more money for this recording.  She has written some very interesting songs, and they are all well crafted.  However, the voice of this recording is not pleasant at all.  It sounds like the singer is suffering from a stroke.  Her voice is not strong at all, and I found her singing voice to be very weak.  I just cannot stand it.  Her singing is awful and she should be ashamed of herself.

Amazon review: I think that this is the worst recording that I have ever heard.

Amazon review: Her voice is just terrible.  When I first heard her singing I thought that she sounded like a robot.

Amazon review: I have always had a fascination with her voice.  She has a very unique voice.  I think that she is very talented at the guitar, but I have not met many people who could sing like her.

She is a horrible person and she should be ashamed of herself.  I will be buying more of her records.

Amazon review: I'm not normally a fan of remixes, and in this case there is no exception. If you have not bought the original OneRepublic album (Dreaming Out Loud) that has this song on it, you are missing out. I understand Timbaland helped OneRepublic get started, but there is no reason for taking credit for someone else's song.  I feel that Timbaland's contribution to the sound/mix of the song could easily have been left out. I much prefer the original mix to this version.

This is not similar to early ska or the Two-Tone Era ska.  It is too peppy and energetic.  This album is good clean fun.  I cannot tell you what the songs are about because I speak no Japanese.  There is only one song completely in English.  Most songs are in Japanese with a couple of lines in English and a title in English.

Amazon review: I am posting review firstly to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased about couple of years ago. Delayed as my review may be it is sincere. I am a fan of Ultimate Spinach and i consider them one of the best bands of the bosstown rock scene. I had been looking forward to receiving the CD but when it arrived i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at the begining of every track. I am afraid that this is totally irresponsible on the part of iris records.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

Amazon review: Michael John Poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics. I love two songs on this album especially: "Forgiven" and "The Maiden and the Messenger". "Forgiven" is a beautiful duet between Michael John and a young girl who has an angelic voice. I actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear "The Maiden and the Messenger". Michael John played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it, asking what I thought of the song. I loved it the first time I heard it and have loved it ever since.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time.

This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review: I like to pick out 3 songs on an album that I would play on my fantasy AOR radio program. I can't find 1 here. Just when I think I like what I'm hearing they find a way to blow the deal. Almost every song is overplayed. Talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most songs off the road. Recalculating! Weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the CD. They can surely play but need some serious direction. Will Jennings greatest advice for Peter Wolf was to keep it simple stupid.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I know most of the reviews here are from people that know Danny or listen to him producing an AM talk show and have a certain affinity for him. Their reviews seem a little biased at best. The truth is that while this album definitely calls back to old country music, it does so in the most generic way possible. Nothing here is really worth listening to more than once, and really once you've gotten to the chorus of each song you've pretty much heard all of it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A very good album from a talented young singer/songwriter. I was somewhat surprised at the way this album was recorded but it really shows. He was able to find his own sound and bring his voice to life. He is a very good singer. Not a bad voice, just not a very good one. The arrangements on this album are very good. It would have been difficult to find any better than this. Not a bad album, just a little too generic to be considered great.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit that not all of the songs on this album are of the most memorable type. I think that the ones I like the most are "Little by Little" and "I Feel the Same" and "Fooled Again". The latter is a real departure from the album's original version, and as I've stated before, I think it is the most memorable song on the album. But the original version of "Fooled Again" is much more pleasant to listen to. This is an album that I will continue to listen to over and over again.

Amazon review: Michael John Poirier is doing what he does best: making songs that are both beautiful and haunting. The songs are all well-written and each have their own personality to them.

Amazon review: Adam's voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable.  His second album was the best - he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs.  The material is weak and the lyrics are laughable.  This is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream "pop" star.  He was never that - his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words.  His interpretation of classics on American Idol (Mad World, Tracks of My Tears), made the songs his own.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I so much wanted to love this album; Dylan as Sinatra. He must really believe that he doesn't sound bad, but it was painful to listen to the off key croaking. I love Dylan and I've been a fan of Frank for a long time. The longing and emotion were somewhat evident, but the production quality of the CD combined with the croaking were too much. I am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and I can drive along the ocean with my windows open.

Amazon review: OreSkaBand is a great third wave ska band.  Unlike most third wave ska bands, they have a clear clean sound.  They do not blend in other styles of music like punk or metal.  This is not similar to early ska or the Two-Tone Era ska.  It is too peppy and energetic.  This album is good clean fun.  I cannot tell you what the songs are about because I speak no Japanese.  There is only one song completely in English.  Most songs are in Japanese with a couple of lines in English and a title in English.

Amazon review: This is a great song to play at a wedding, but not the best one to play for an office party.  The song is pretty good.  The lyrics are weird.  It's about a guy who has to go to a wedding and then he gets stuck in an elevator with his old childhood friend.  The girl that he used to "love" is now married to the guy he used to "hate."  I like the lyrics.  They're weird but they're really well written.  It's kind of funny.

Amazon review: The entire CD is greatly composed of Real R&B music. Scream and Emergency are two of my favorites although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam. Tank's music in the past has always been enjoyable to me but he has really matured with this CD. The great thing is he didn't try to conform to some of the newer antics with his sound, he just stayed true to himself in which I can appreciate. For the ladies. Tank pictures on the inside cover proves to be an extra Bonus for us!

However, this one is ruined by being cut short at the end, before the music is finished.

I thought the ladies dancing with the umbrellas or whatever was kinda cool the first time I saw it but I was wrong.

I like the lyrics and I wish they were sung in Italian, since they are in English.  If you can't understand the Italian, then maybe you can't understand the lyrics.  I'm not sure, but I think he's singing about a couple of people, but the song isn't about those people.

Amazon review: I don's really like the song but I can't see how it can be any kind of "dance" song.  It's just a song that's not really about dancing or anything, it's just just a song with a lot of different words.  The only thing that really stands out about the song is the fact that it's the song "you know we can't live without you."  I don't like that song.  If it was any other song, then I would say that it's very good.  But, it's not.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time.

This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review: This is a compilation of a handful of Riddle's most famous songs. The songs are arranged by Nelson Riddle for the NBC broadcast of the 75th Anniversary of the National Emblem of the United States and are performed by the National Symphony Orchestra. The songs are the songs "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "The Star Spangled Banner II" and are sung by the National Symphony Orchestra. The other three songs that are represented here are "In the Bleak Midwinter," "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," and "The Star Spangled Banner III." I don't think the songs in this compilation will make you feel the loss of the US flag as much as the songs did Riddle's generation, but if you're a patriotic person, you'll be happy to know that one of the songs is sung by the National Symphony Orchestra. The National Symphony Orchestra sounds like a choir with the National Symphony Orchestra, so I think they should be credited on the disc. It certainly makes the songs feel more connected to the real thing. However, I thought there was a little too much emphasis on the words "National Emblem" on the disc, but overall, it's a wonderful compilation.

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a really cool album. I love their stuff, but I can kind of understand why they didn't make this a full-length. It's a really good thing that they have a new album coming out. I have to say, though, that this is a really good album. If you like them, give this a listen.

Amazon review: This type of music does not follow the rules. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned Church Music? I'm serious.  This type of music, known by most in the Ward as "Rock" or "Metal" must be burned and flushed down the toilet. I had to whip my son with my leather belt because he was playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano.  Nirvana was not a good band. The lead yeller committed suicide, which is a direct pathway to Hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible Satan.

Amazon review: George Carlin was a man who was talented in many different aspects. He was creative and every time I listened to his other shows, I laughed so hard I had to stop the recording before I choked. His unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made George Carlin stand out from others in his field.  This album is not creative nor funny. It's just hateful. Mostly it is just ranting about how evil cops, fireman and snitches are, as well as fart and enema jokes.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album. I was a big fan of the movie "The Blues Brothers," which was based on the life of this band.  The music was great but this album is really bad.

Amazon review: I had to give this album an overall negative review.  This music is not meant for the ears of my young children.  I can't find the point in listening to this garbage for longer than two minutes.  I will not even bother listening to this album in my car.  I think it's time for all of us who love music to boycott this company.  This company has no respect for their customers.

Amazon review: I enjoyed this CD, but I have to say that I didn't really like the song "I Will Survive" because it was so un-gospel-like.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my wife and myself.  The songs are good, but I don't think that they are "Christian," because the songs are very pop-oriented.  It is a good CD, but I have to say that I found it a little bland.  The only song that I like is the last song, "God Willing & Able."  I think that they should have put more emphasis on the other tracks.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of those CDs that I would pass on, if I could, for fear of being offended.  The songs are all very well-written and produced, but the lyrics are all incredibly offensive.  The songs are all about how people should be put to death, how people should have their heads cut off, and how people should be shot.  I don't know why these songs are allowed to be sold at Christian bookstores, but I hope that the author of this album is not Christian.  It is obvious that he is a racist.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say, I didn't like this album as much as I thought I would.  I don't think that there is anything "Christian" about this album.  The songs are all about how people should be killed, and how people should have their heads cut off.  These are the kind of songs that I think would fit in with the lyrics on an Eminem or NWA album (or on the soundtrack of a bad horror movie).  I don't think that this album truly represents "Christian" music, but I guess my opinion is not very important.

Amazon review: I cannot believe that people still buy this garbage.  I don't understand why people keep buying this album.  The only good thing about this album is that it is very short.  I would have much rather listened to a CD full of songs with a little more of a soul to them.

Amazon review: this album counts only "in too deep" and "fat lip" as decent songs. The rest is, well, all filler. And the record is only half an hour long, so there are only about another five complete songs (track one is a reminder of Maiden`s "number of the beast" and track three is 50 seconds long). It makes you wonder if the guys that wrote the two hit singles wrote the rest of the album as well. Piece of advice, tape or download the singles and spend your money on something else.

Amazon review: I play this to help rock my baby to sleep and she must find it so calming because it works every time :)
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is terribly, embarrassingly boring. I know that Phil Spector isn't dead yet, but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he's been subjected to this rebel-biker jagoff bupkis. If you thought Garbage was garage, you just might possibly mistake The Raveonettes' latest stinker for an entire landfill. In either case, take my advice and head in the opposite direction. "In & Out of Control" is nothing more than Disney music for the cutting set.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Well in short, not good at all, not my chemical romance style, if they felt like getting back to the basic's at least go back to decent music like three cheers.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is very much like a very simple, very fast version of the song 'You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman'. It is nice to know that someone can make a song like that sound good, but it is a very odd song. I think there is something more to it. It's not a great song, it's not even a good song. It's just... Well... It's just some people's music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this song a lot. I love how it starts off with what sounds like the vocals on the radio (a song that I love too) and then there's only a couple of bars before the singer grabs the mic again. It's very upbeat yet still very positive. The lyrics are nice, but the music is the best part. I would definitely recommend this for your next play list.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a really good pop song, and the lyrics are very catchy too!

###
Amazon review: I liked this song, but i'm not sure if i can say that it was awesome, or i just didn't like it as much as other songs. The song starts with the same drums as the previous song, then it goes into the chorus, but then the drums go back and sound like nothing again, and then the beat that i've been waiting for since the beginning of the song happens. The song is catchy and the lyrics are great, but i just didn't like the song that much.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a very simple song, but the message in the song is very powerful. It means that no matter what happens in your life, you can still make the best of it. If you look at it from a philosophical standpoint, then the song is very very meaningful. The song would make a great ring tone or as a ringtone because you can make it ring by just playing the song. This song will help you feel better if you are down and out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really love this song, it's very empowering and very positive. The lyrics are so good, and the music is very nice too. I love the guitar solo in the end.

And the song is really boring.

Amazon review: If you want conscious breathing exercises, I would rate this a 5.  Great for someone with asthma or other breathing issues.  Each step is breathing between different points of the body from eye brows to fingers to toes. The problem I had with sleeping was long pauses between vocal instructions distracting pulling the focus to another place.  I bought the CD to get further into conscious deep sleep.  I had the reverse effect.  However, as an aid in the morning getting oxygen moving through the body, the meditation does work.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Ok, so it ultra new age and designed for meditation, etc.  It still doesn't work for me but that may be just personal.

Amazon review: Very interesting and useful, and it will help you with many medical issues.  The audio is wonderful.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: First, I think it might be for some people, but I find it difficult to stay focused.  I would say it's better suited for people who don't have chronic pain issues.  I think it is a little too slow to help you with insomnia, but you will get there.  I like it because it gives you a general idea of how to get things done, but I think it could be a little more direct.  I also think it could be a little too much for many people.  I have asthma and I think it would be fine to record a couple of minutes of breathing, but I think I would have to be really, really quiet to get it to work.  It would probably be more helpful to me if I was able to keep my attention on the breath throughout the recording.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very interesting.  It's kind of like a meditation app, but it's more like a music app.  I would suggest using it during the day when you are doing something.  It might be too intense for night time.

For me, I would recommend a friend, because I have a hard time following instructions and meditating.  The audio is very good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The audio and images are good.  I think this is a good app for people who are interested in meditation.  It's not for me.  I have asthma and can not focus.  I would like the app to not record if I am in a noisy area.  It would be good to have the app record a couple minutes when I am doing something that is not meditating.  I think this app is useful for those who do not have a lot of time to meditate.

This morning I woke up to see it was almost 6:00am.  I was worried about getting up early.  I had a hard time sleeping last night.  I had to take the dogs out because I just didn't want to get out of bed.  I had to get up at 4am and then had to drive around and then drive home.  It was a very long day for me.  I had to work this morning and then at home I took a nap.  I slept pretty soundly.  I woke up at 5am and decided to go to the gym.  I thought it would be easier to just walk with the dogs.  I wanted to make it look like I was walking with the dogs.  I walked the dogs for about an hour.  I got back home and watched TV for a while and then went to bed.  I slept a little bit and woke up at about 10am to tell my wife that I had to go to work.  I drove

Amazon review: Possibly the best soundtrack ever to this genre and kind of movie.  This soundtrack is a perfect example of how important music is to the overall feeling of a movie.  Nothing fancy. Just simple organic fiddle and guitar along with Tim McIntire's great voice fits perfectly with the time period.  A perfect example of how less can be far more effective.

It's a nice listen, but nothing to get excited about.

Amazon review: I first heard this song when I was about 10 years old, and it immediately transported me to a dream that I would never escape.  I have been listening to music ever since, and I really enjoyed this song.  It's a nice, slow, rocking song that would make a great background/meditation track.  However, I think this song is more suited to more upbeat music... it is the first song I can remember that has been this kind of upbeat and fun and light and happy.  If I had the choice, I would listen to this song over and over again.  If I could do it over, I would change nothing about this song.  This song is what brought me to this site.

Amazon review: I'm sorry this one was a little too "sweet" for me.  I like the lyrics though, and it's not an all-around terrible song.  I was surprised when I listened to the chorus, because I thought the rest of the song would be a completely different one.  I like the lyrics and the music, but it's not my favorite of this song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: One of my favorite songs ever.  I love this song, and I love the fact that it was written by one of my favorite musicians of all time, John Anderson.  I absolutely love John Anderson and I'm lucky that I get to live in the same country as him.  When I first heard this song at a party, I thought that everyone else was singing it right along with me, but I was wrong.  I was the only one in the entire room singing "I was in need of some love / I was in need of some love" so I listened to the song and found out that I didn't know the words at all.  I had to sing them over and over until I could finally sing it.  John Anderson's version of the song is really beautiful.  He really captures the feeling of the original in a new, interesting way, and it makes you feel like you're really part of the song.  It's a great song, and I can't think why I didn't post a review sooner.  It's got a great message, and I really think it's a great song.  I know I'm going to have to get it on my new iPod, because it's one of the songs I listen to every day.

Amazon review:  I was at a party tonight, and I was soooo happy.  I was so happy that I almost didn't notice the time, because I was so happy, I just wanted to dance and sing along with the music.  So, I did.  It was great, and I'm really glad that my friend liked the song, because I was so happy, I almost didn't notice the time.  This is a really good song, and I'm really glad I listened to it.  I think it's really fun, and I love all the little sounds that add to the song.  It's a really great song.  It's really well written.  The message is funny.  It's also really good.  I'm really happy when I listen to it, and I think it's a great song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: What I like about this song is that it goes against everything that the world says about love.  It tells you that love is a lot of work and that it's not worth you giving up everything that makes you happy for love.  It's a song that makes you think that you can love someone for the rest of your life.  It's also a song that makes you look at the world and see that there are many things that people have to work at and that they may never find the perfect person.  This song is truly a beautiful song for those who are hurting or those that are looking for love.  It brings out the tender side in everyone who listens to it.
