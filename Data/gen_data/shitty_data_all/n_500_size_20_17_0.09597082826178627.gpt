Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: They are one of the most popular bands in my life.  I love them.  I love their music.  I love how they can make songs and have them sound so good.  They make me sing along.  I wish there was more to them.  But they are worth all the good that they do.  They make me feel happy and happy they make me feel happy.  I am glad they are so loved by so many people.  I wish they could play more in the future.  I cannot wait to hear more.

Amazon review: I am from Ireland and I am a huge fan of The Libertines.  I first heard them when I was in the third grade and it was the single of the month.  I remember not even being allowed to listen to music.  They were not allowed to listen to music before bed time.  So I have been listening to them since then and they have become a very big part of my life.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I first fell in love with the band when I was 15.  I bought the album, The Libertines, and listened to it constantly.  I listened to every song and every word.  I would wake up at night to listen to it.  I would stay up late into the night, playing the songs over and over again.  I felt a connection to the music.  Whenever I would watch TV, I would sing the words to the songs and the band would stop the show and join me.

Amazon review: I listen to this album all the time.  I had been a fan of the band since I was in grade school.  They had made a major impression on me. I would listen to them every night.  I would listen to all of their albums.  They made the soundtrack to my life.  I would listen to their songs, in the car, driving to school.  I would listen to them while I was working and during my lunch breaks.

Amazon review: This album is just a bunch of pop songs.  The band members are all good singers, but none of them can really sing their own songs.  The songs on this album are just songs that were written by other bands.  Most of the songs on this album are just generic pop songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I know this album will be hated by some because I am not a fan of modern pop music.  But I love this band.  I love "Hollywood" and "Dirty," the songs on this album.  I loved how they opened the album with a song called "Hollywood."  It just sounded like the band was having fun and making fun of themselves.  I loved the song, "Dirty."  It was the kind of song that was so catchy and so enjoyable that you can't help but sing along.  I loved how they opened the album with the song, "Livin' in a Hole."  It sounded like a party in the backyard being played by the band.  The song is just so fun and so energetic.  It's just a great song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this band.  I love how they have changed and evolved as a band.  They are now one of my favorite bands, and the only reason why I hated this album was because I didn't like a song called "I Hate You" and I hated the song that was in the middle of the album, "Hustlin'," because it was just so plain.  But after listening to the album, I realized that the band has changed.  Now they are one of my favorite bands.  I am glad they have evolved so much.  And I am glad they have changed and evolved.  I am glad they are still playing.  I am glad they still make music.  I am glad they are still alive.

I've been to the hospital with a serious illness and found myself singing this song with my doctor sitting next to me.  I have been to my children's schools to sing this song with their teachers and I've been to my children's sports games and have been singing this song before the games and after the games.  I love the song so much that I have learned the words and have memorized them.  This is the song that has made my life and my family's life better.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  "Empyrean" is a very good song, but the lyrics are a little lackluster. Too much "fantasies" about how good life is in the sky, and how great the world is and how God will save us soon.  "The Bloodbath" is a great song by a great band, but the lyrics are a bit too heavy for the song, and it does not end on a great note.  "Rising" is the best song here, as the lyrics are very powerful, and the chorus is very catchy. The last three songs are all very good, but they all come from the same album.  "Walls" is one of the weakest tracks on this album.  The lyrics are decent, but the guitar playing is a bit too much for the song.  "Hymn" is a very good song, and it has a very good ending, but the lyrics just aren't as good as they should be.  "Demons" is one of the strongest tracks on this album, and the lyrics are very powerful, but they are not as good as they should be.

I read this book when I was 18 years old. It was a great book, but it was too long and I was not quite ready for a full length novel. I finished it and decided to share it with you. This is a great read. It's an interesting look at the world of advertising copy and what it means to be "different".
I read this book while waiting for a friend to get out of jail. I had just gotten my first job, and I was very anxious. I was pretty upset as well. This is a great book to read just before you go to work. It makes you realize that life can be hard, but you shouldn't give up.
I enjoyed this book a lot. I think it's a very good book to read when you have a hard day.
I love that this book has a lot of humor in it. It's a good book to read before you go to bed. I think it's a great book to read after you've had a bad day.
I'm not a fan of "girl/girl" books or "lesbian" books, but this book had a lot of humor mixed in with the story. I think it's a great book to read if you're a girl/girl or a lesbian. It's a great book to read before you go to bed. I think it's a good book to read in the middle of the day. I think it's a great book to read in the middle of the day if you're a girl/girl. I think it's a great book to read after you've had bad luck in the morning. It seems like everybody is having a bad day.
This book has a lot of humor in it. I don't know if it's too serious, or not serious enough. I think it's a good book to read when you're in a bad mood. I think this book is a good book to read if you're a girl/girl. I think this book is a good book to read if you're in a bad mood.

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.

Amazon review: I've been waiting for this CD so long, I was actually really interested in Jackie's new album, but then I found out that it was a duet with Billy Currington.

I love the idea behind this album and I think the songs are pretty, but I don't think they are any good, especially the songs with Billy.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: Great music.  The comments here and on NPR helped lead me to this great disk.  It was very difficult to play my copy.  Like most people, I have more then one device to play a CD in.  This CD does not work in most of them.

Amazon review:  I have gone to far with the Amazon review system.  I have been in the process of putting on a CD collection for some time.  I had a lot of these albums, but I had not put them all on CD's.  After talking with the band, I decided that I would take the band and their CDs off of my Amazon account.  I did not know there was a whole new system to do this.  I was not aware that I could place this CD on my wishlist.  I received an email from Amazon today informing me that I had placed this cd on my wishlist.  It has been on there for 6 weeks.  I put it on my wishlist, and I do not see it on there yet.  I just ordered another copy.  It will be here this afternoon.  It is a beautiful and well put on album.  There is a definite mellow quality to it.
