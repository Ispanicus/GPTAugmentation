Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: I have heard all the songs from this artists, and I have to say that I really love this song, I love the beat, I love the style of the song, I love the lyrics, I love the feel of the song, I love the music, I love the whole song, I love the harmony, I love the voice on the song, I love the guitar, and I love the piano parts, and I love how the whole song goes.  I love how the vocals are always on point, and I love how the whole song is not just a bunch of chorus and verse and bridge, but the song goes on and on and on. It's amazing, I love the song, and I love the artist Brandy, but I think this song is just a bunch of bad luck, because it doesn't sound like a Brandy song at all, it sounds like a song where Alfie Boe is singing it, and I am sure that's not a good thing. Please don't waste my time with this song.  This song was good when it first came out, and then it became bad and now it's become worse.  Please stop making this song, it's bad enough that you are making a bad product out of it, but add in your bad luck, it makes it even worse.  I have tried to listen to the song, it doesn't sound like it at all, and I am sure it's not a Brandy song.  Please stop making this song and I will gladly give you my money back.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: I had a few ideas for a song that would be perfect for the site.  I tried one in 5 minutes and was happy with the end result.  It was a hit.

Amazon review: This is a very good example of a simple song.  There are a couple of problems I have noticed though.  I've noticed that the song does not have a chord progression.  The song is also a little repetitive.  I'll be adding to the song as I go.  I like the simplicity of it.  I think that I will have to write down a few more songs to make it as good as it is.  It's a very simple song that has a good melody and lyrics.  I hope to have a few more songs to add to the site very soon.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.

That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I was about 12 or 13 years old when I first saw this song.  My mother had just returned from a long trip and I was in the kitchen doing my homework when the song came on the radio. It was playing in a jukebox in the cafe and the lyrics were about the bus ride she had taken.  I never knew that the song was about a woman, but I do now.  Her name was Mary and she was the love of my life.  I loved her and she loved me and I will always love her.  To this day I can never find a word she didn't say when she was around me.  I think she was born on the 29th of October.  I have always loved music and would like to thank whoever put this song on the internet.  I think it's one of the best songs ever.

**W** e were very lucky to receive an invitation from the Australian Western Wonderland Touring Club to attend the Australian Western Wonderland Touring Club Touring Tour '09 Show on the 31st of December 2009.

This is a beautiful event that has become a wonderful annual event for us all. The event started out with the announcement of the 2011 show and as this year's event begins, we take time to reflect on all the wonderful experiences we have had in the past and present.

We are so very grateful to be included at this spectacular event and we hope to see many of you there.

Thank you

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: This is a great album. The last album I listened to of Rieker's that I owned was his "Constantine" CD.  This is a wonderful collection of songs that are very well played and performed.  The album does have a few issues though like the lack of a few songs on the CD (I'd like to have seen the CD come with the CD version of "Harmony in the Valley" it is an unreleased song for me) and a few other small issues that I can't seem to find.  Overall I think the CD is a wonderful listen.

Amazon review: What's this?  This is the third album by the same artist I've purchased - The first was on CD for 10 bucks and the second for $20.  This is a wonderful CD.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of the Beatles.  I liked the original albums and liked the concerts, but I hated the song "Get Back" (from the first album).  This is by far the worst of all their albums.  The only good thing is that the vocals are good and the harmonies are great.  The rest is just annoying.  I did like the intro of "I Want to Hold Your Hand" very much.  The next track, "I've Just Seen a Face," is also good.  "Love Me Do" is by far the best track.  The only good thing about this album is that the music is extremely varied and it has a good amount of good songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not worth the money.  The music is pretty good, but the packaging is awful.  I have two pieces of this stuff in my car and now I am very displeased to find that only one of them actually works.  I will return the CD to Amazon and they will refund my money, but I will not buy another copy of this album until they fix the packaging.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Is a nice album but it has some very obvious errors.  One song has a word written backwards and the words in the song are scrambled.  The album covers are also quite poor.  This is a very good album, but if you don't own the CD and need to listen to it, you can't get past the packaging.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Like the album but not the cover.  The music is good but the cover is awful.  The title track is the best of the album and "I'm Just Wild About Harry" is a good song.  The cover is very bad, you would not know it was a Beatles cover until you open the cover.  There are only two songs on the album that I like and that is the best track.  I also like "I'm Only Sleeping" and "The End."  The CD is quite good but the cover is not worth the money.

Amazon review: The only Beatles album I have listened to.  This is a very good album.  There are some good songs on this album but it doesn't have as much good music as most Beatles albums do.  There is also a good amount of bad songs on this album.  The songs are short and simple.  They don't have as much variety as most Beatles albums.  They have a good amount of good songs and some good and some bad songs.  The lyrics are very simple.  The only good song on the album is "I Wanna Hold Your Hand."  The album is also very long and the songs are all very long.  There is a very good variety of songs on this album.  The music is good and the vocals are very good.  The music is very good and the lyrics are very good.  There is also a good amount of good songs on this album.  The only problem with this album is that it is very expensive.

Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.
