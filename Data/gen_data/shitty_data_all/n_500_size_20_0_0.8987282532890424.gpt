Amazon review: This song was really good.  I liked it.  But, I wish the voice was slightly higher.  I was listening to it on my iPod and it sounded just like a person speaking.  It's hard to imagine that it's coming from the mouth of a person.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really liked the album, but it just doesn't work for me. I guess I am just too used to a more conventional, and more well known type of comedy, like the kind of stuff from Jerry Seinfeld, or Monty Python, or even the sketch comedy of Monty Python/the Pythons.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I didn't know who Dave Chappelle was before I bought this album. I found the name amusing, but then I thought, "oh, he sounds like an American Indian." So I thought I'd give it a try.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted.

Amazon review: Nicely produced, but this album is all about the vocals and the songwriting.  This ain't a good album, but it's a nice collection of songs.  It takes away from the music, and you're left with an empty shell.  I'm not a fan of this style.  It's not what I listen to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the music, but this is an album for people who are looking for something more than a fun listen.  As it stands, I'm not going to listen to this.  I will say that I do like the songs, but they're not amazing.  However, there are some great songs on here.  This is a nice collection of songs.  I do have to admit, I liked the "Macho Man" song.  It's a good song, but it's not the best song on the album.  I'll give it a 7.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the third release by the legendary Otis Redding.  I've been a lover of these songs ever since I heard them in the movie "Greetings, Mr. Carter."  It's sad to see this album go.  I don't think this is as good as his previous two records.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is great! Great lyrics, great melodies, great songs.  I love it all!!  I highly recommend this album to anybody who is a fan of Otis Redding.  I'm a big fan of Otis Redding, and I want to show my support of his music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Great album but, like others have said, it's over long and lacks a strong theme... it's over too soon.  Overall, the album is solid, but it's just the beginning of Otis Redding's music.  I still have to say that it's one of the greatest albums I've heard in years.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this artist since his early days.  I used to have his picture on my wall and now I own the CD collection (from the 70s and 80s).  So this is a great album!

Amazon review: This is an older review.  I was a big fan of the 80s/90s version of Otis Redding.  His music is so good!  I really enjoy his music and will be a long time fan.  I'll give it a 5.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not a fan of this album.  It has a few great songs, but the rest are just mediocre.  I don't understand why they would release an album like this.  They're just trying to make money.  Not a fan.  I don't care about the vocals.  They're not very good.  The most annoying part is that the band members use the same lead singer for every song.  They use the same guitar player for every song.  I don't understand why they would release an album like this... It's really annoying!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the music.  I like the message.  I like the lyrics, but it's just a bunch of songs.  This album sounds like it was produced by the same person as the first album.  It's just not good.

###
Amazon review: I like the album but it's too similar to the first album.  The first album is much better.  I'm sure the album is good, but I feel like it's just another attempt at making money.  I don't know how they can say that the songwriting is better, but they make it seem so.  I give it a 2.5

Amazon review: This is a mediocre album.  I will say that the songs are good, but the album is mediocre.  I'm not a fan of this kind of music and I have to say that I'm a big fan of Otis Redding.  This album is just a bunch of songs.  I'm not a fan.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an album i had to listen to.  I love Otis Redding and I'm a big fan.  I also like the music.  I'm not really a fan of this kind of music and this album is kind of like Otis Redding's worst album.  But it's not bad.  It's just not good.  It's okay, but it's not great.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album, for those of you unfamiliar with it, is just a collection of songs from Slipknot's first 3-4 years.  It doesn't seem to be about anything, but you listen to it to get a sense of what they were doing.  The first couple of songs are great, but overall the songs on this album are pretty bad.  I love the cover art, it has a cool simplicity to it that really sets the record apart from other covers.

###
Amazon review: I thought this album was good. The guitar solos are great. The vocals on songs like Runnin' Wounded and I believe on the last song, are great. However I thought the song Go Away was bad. It sounds like a demo from a band trying to sell a demo album and it sounded like they were trying to sound like the same band from a few albums before. The second song is better, but the song itself doesn't sound like anything else that I've heard Slipknot. I know that the album is good because I got it and I really liked it. I just don't feel like it was worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought the Slipknot CD because I wanted to hear how the band sounded like without Corey Taylor. I am really disappointed because the band has changed so much since I have been listening to them. I was hoping I could just go back and listen to the old Slipknot. I hate how they are all so similar. I feel like I am listening to a completely different band now. I don't understand why they have to change sound or try to sound the same. I don't like it at all. The songs sound like they were recorded 10 years ago.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

The message that the new me is spreading is to be a better person and to love everyone, the enemy and the friends.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of the Zac Brown Band when I first got into them.  Their new album is a disappointment.  Now, I'm a huge fan of their previous albums.

Amazon review: I love these guys.  I have enjoyed all their albums so far.  I have loved the music and the lyrics.  I will continue to buy the albums and the music.
