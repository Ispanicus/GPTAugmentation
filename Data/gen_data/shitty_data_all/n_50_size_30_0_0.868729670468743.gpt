Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am writing in regard to the album "The Complete Works for Piano" by Robert Levin, because the songs are so beautiful. The music of this album is a good example of the most beautiful music created by the best musicians of our time. However, the booklet of "The Complete Works for Piano" is not very clear. When you read the words "Robert Levin" on the cover, it is hard to know what the composer of the music actually is. The publisher of this book should provide a little more information on the composers of the music.

Amazon review: I would have to say that I'm impressed with the quality of the recordings of the Sonatas by Franz Schubert (including The Trout). I find it difficult to compare them all, but the overall sound is excellent. I have a couple of albums by Schubert (two CDs) and one by Chopin. I would recommend the recordings of the Trout Sonata and the Sonatas by Schubert to anyone who is interested in this genre. The recordings by Schubert are not as good as the recordings of Chopin, but they are good.

Amazon review: The first Chopin album I ever listened to was this one: Chopin Piano Sonatas and Concertos. It was a cassette that I bought at an event and it was a very special album. It was the first Chopin album that I purchased on vinyl. I think I was six years old when I bought it. The recordings are of Chopin's concertos with his own piano. It was a wonderful thing to hear his music. His songs are so beautiful. I don't think that I'll ever forget them.

Amazon review: I just bought the complete works for piano of Franz Liszt. I was interested to see what this album would bring. I am a fan of Liszt in general, but the music of Franz Liszt is not his best work. I like some of the Lisztian piano music, but the music of Liszt is very repetitive and very boring. The music of Liszt is in the same genre as Schubert and Chopin.

A few of my friends got me an opportunity to review this album, so I'm giving it a try.  While I'm not giving this album 5 stars, I do think it has a lot of good songs on it.

I do hope they can make a return to form.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: So not bad, but so far I know that not a lot of people are enjoying this as much as I did. I am not a huge fan of it yet, but it's not bad. However, the most glaring flaw is the vocals. I don't know if it's just a bad sound, or if the music is being misused, or if it's the production team just not giving the artists enough credit, but the vocals just don't work and don't fit the music. I just didn't like the vocals on this song. I like the music, but not the vocals.

Amazon review: "The Broadway Musicals: Celebrating 50 Years" - Very Good for the most part. The music and lyrics are nice. The lyrics are very good. Not sure why the cast and crew didn't do more to make it a musical. Still sounds like a Broadway show. I thought it was worth the 20 bucks I spent on it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I found myself listening to a song almost every night.  I found myself listening to a song at least once every day.  This is a very nice record.  I am not sure why it hasn't been released in stores yet, but it is a nice album.  It's a good record, you'd have to be crazy to not like it.  This is really a great album.  It's a little expensive, but I think you get what you pay for.  I am sure a lot of people would enjoy it, and I am sure a lot of people will enjoy it.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very, very good cd.  I love the sound of the voice of the girls.  There is nothing else like it. It's like hearing a new CD. It's not quite like anything I've ever heard. I like that it is a little different from the usual radio pop music. They have good harmonies, good musicianship and a good sound. I have no idea whether the lead singers are actually singers or not. I like all of their songs, but I don't listen to them on a regular basis. I'm sure I'll become a big fan of the band. But for now I'm just going to enjoy listening to them and hope that the cd turns out to be a success.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have to say that I like this cd. I don't think that I have ever heard a CD that sounded like this. It's a very nice sound that is very different than anything that I have heard.

It's a great addition to anybody's collections.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album was a big disappointment for me. I am not a huge fan of Jewel (I think she is too cute) and I liked this album. However, I found the band's sound to be lacking. The sound is very "pop" and I think that it could have been recorded in a much more sophisticated studio. The singing/recording is very poor and they do not have a distinctive "sound". They have a unique sound but this CD is very lacking in this field.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is great. If you like Jewel's music, you need to listen to this album. It's a much better and more original album than I expected. The songs are great. I love the song, "You've Got A Friend", it is the song that I like the most from this album. The songs are very well written. The vocals are very good. The musicianship is great. I don't think that this band is a "sell out". I thought that I would have to listen to this for many more months before I could enjoy it, but I have been listening to it for only a day and it has already become my favorite album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD is by far the best album I have ever heard. I love the sound of the album and the songs are really great.  Jewel's voice is very good, and I like to listen to her sing.  I think that this band is great, as well, and I want to see them play. I hope that they will tour.  This album is not a "sell out", as many people might think. Jewel is an amazing vocalist, and I really like all of the songs.  I also enjoyed the live band that I heard during the CD listening, and this CD is definitely a must have for any music lover.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD has been a real treat and I am glad to have finally seen them at a concert.  I've been a fan of Jewel since I was a little girl.  I love the music and her voice. I've been listening to Jewel since high school and I have always liked her songs.  This CD has been a real treat. The band is very well known, and I have heard about them. I'm glad that I finally saw them, and I was happy to see them. They are a real treat. I have never heard them live before.  I would recommend this CD to Jewel fans and anyone who enjoys Jewel's music.

I like the music, but not the sound.  It's a strange thing.  I have listened to this album for about a month, and I am really enjoying it. I think that I will enjoy it for a long time.  I will definitely buy another CD by this band.  This one is not a "sell out".

I really wanted to buy each song individually, but they couldn't locate the entire album (and I didn't want to buy it from the store).
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: the first half of this album was pretty good but the second half of this album is just... a bunch of stuff! Like a lot of other new age music, the lyrics are poorly thought out and the melodies aren't memorable.

Amazon review: I am a "new age" aficianado and I am very pleased with the album. I was a little dissappointed with the second half of the album, however. They did not use the same band that used the first half of the album. This was a fun album, but it could use a little more variety.

Amazon review: I purchased this album about 2 weeks ago to try and improve my own music collection. The first two songs in the album are very good but the rest of the album is just a lot of crap. I can't even remember what the song is called. It's not bad, but it's not good either.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Wow so worth it! Did not mind spending 20 bucks when I can listen to this on repeat all day.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.
