Amazon review: There are really only a few things in life we can count on. One is that we will die. Another is that Motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding, heavy, jam filled album and once again, they do not disappoint at all. Mikkey Dee sounds amazing and purely flawless on the drums while Campbell plays his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solos. Despite all the health problems Lemmy has had this year, he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry, heavy snarling vocal performance.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger "early Mode" post Speak and Spell choice.

People are People (The Man Comes Around)

People are People (The Man Comes Around) is the third album by the American hard rock band Motorhead. The album was released in May 1988.

Critical reception

Giving the album four stars out of five for the AllMusic Review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine found that "it's a solid and rewarding album that is, in its own way, more than just a collection of hits. Its greatest asset is its unpretentious, unabashedly raw and unafraid of the truth, which is one reason the album is still so revered, even 30 years after its initial release." He further added, "This is a collection of songs that, while not as innovative as the late-period albums, are still worth listening to." Giving the album three stars out of five for the Q, Scott Schinder found that "as long as you have played this album in a few years, you will find something new and exciting in this. But as a whole, people are People is a good album that is not worth a repeat purchase."

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Amazon review: I was surprised to find out that this song is the latest single off of Dylan's latest album, but that doesn't mean it sucks. I like the vocal, and the lyrics. The vocals are a little too high, but that's more of a personal preference. The guitar is a little too low and the drums are too fast, but they both hold a nice melody and compliment the vocals. I'm not big on guitar in rock but I like this song. I really like it. I like the lyrics when I hear them. The song is a bit overproduced, but I don't mind. This is a good song. I have to say I'm excited for his new album.

But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger "early Mode" post Speak and Spell choice.

Amazon review: This is the most amazing, inspiring album I have ever heard. I was born in 1961, and I remember this album from when I was young, the early 70's. I've been a fan of the Doors since I was 6 years old and this album has changed my life. I've listened to every record since I was 6 years old but this album is my all time favorite. I really want to own this album, I can't find it anywhere on the internet!

Amazon reviews: I was born in 1965 - my first year of high school. This album is what brought me to music - I am so glad I took the time to seek it out, and to actually learn how to play the guitar and sing - it gave me the tools to play in a band. I was a huge Doors fan from the first record I heard - "Love Me Two Times" - to this one - "Light My Fire". I have been a fan of the Doors for over 50 years - I used to sneak into the studio where they were recording the "Voodoo Lounge" album thinking I was a fan.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording, which is often far from modern convention.  I personally think this is one of the best that I have heard of.  The sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical.  Maybe Martzy is a bit on the same page with Haendel and Grumiaux.  Quite far from Heifetz, Milstein and younger violinists.  If you like more objective styles, this is not the best option.  Stay with Szeryng or Milstein.

Amazon review: Nickelback essentially sum up everything that is wrong with the music industry today. What else can I say? This stuff is so bad it makes me go cross-eyed.

Amazon review: Nickelback is very popular for being a bad band and it makes sense, because I'm sure they are popular because they are bad. And it's also very true. I like Nickelback as a band, and this song is a fine tribute to the band. I also like the lyric, which is not all bad.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Nickelback, and this song is one that I personally consider one of their best. The song is not as well-known as the other songs, but it is worth knowing that this song is a Nickelback tribute and a very good one at that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have had Nickelback on repeat over the past year. When I hear this song I instantly think of them. I like this song because it is a tribute to Nickelback, and I think that is really cool. My only complaint is that the guitar solo is a bit too long!

###
Amazon review: My favorite Nickelback song. I think it is a great song and I am glad that they are playing it. In no way am I a fan of Nickelback, but I am a fan of this song because it is so good and I don't want them to stop playing it. :)

Amazon review: This is one of their newer songs and it is their first new song in almost eight years. I think this is a good song, but I'm not sure if I would put it as my favorite. I think it's a good song, but I don't consider it their best. It is very catchy and I think it is a good song.

Amazon review: Its sad to see him going down the same path as Brad Paisley and putting out this type of garbage. I can't not help but laugh at how bad this song is when I hear it. Sounds like something that an 18 year old should be singing not someone nearly 40.  I try not to be "that fan" but his newer stuff doesn't compare to his first 3 albums.

Amazon review: I love this song. It reminds me of a friend of mine who would sing a song with the lyrics "I'm in pain, I'm in pain, I'm in pain, I'm in pain.

Amazon review: This is from the first album "Let it Roll" and is an epic song.  This song is so good that you have to hear it twice to believe it.  This song has so many amazing parts to it, and this one has an amazing hook in the chorus.  It's a song that I wish I could sing.  It's so different from the rest of the songs on the album.  That is one of the things that I love about this album.  Even though it's not super popular, it's still a good song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is actually the most popular song on the album.  It's pretty bad.  The vocalist is decent enough, but the lyricist is just plain stupid.

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

###
Amazon review: After all of the hoopla surrounding the new CD, I must say that this album is not worth the money.  Although I have heard that the album was remastered, I can't find any information on that.  The only way I could tell that the album was remastered was that the cover art was different.  The last time I have had a remastered CD, the CD was actually remastered from a different recording, and not a master copy.  So, while I can't verify the remastering, I can't dispute it either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album does come with a booklet and a CD, but the booklet is a compilation of essays and pictures about the life and career of Laura Ingalls Wilder.  I am a huge fan of Little House on the Prairie, and I have an entire room dedicated to the Little House books.  So, having this book, and the CD, is a disappointment to me.  I am a fan of Wilder, and I would have paid the $20 to get the book, booklet, and CD as well.  I think if I had bought the book separately, I would have been more interested.  I would have had a better understanding about the life of Laura Ingalls Wilder and the life of Laura Ingalls Wilder's family.  Also, there are no pictures on the CD.  The CD cover is a picture of the Little House in the Wilder's home.

I have been with 'The Band' for a long time and am one of the first people they have signed to their new label, The Capitol. This is not one of their better albums, but a fair one. I would classify this album as a '60s album, but not the '70s or '80s. The songs are not outstanding, but it is pretty.  I like the songs well enough, the problem is that they don't have a voice to really sing them.  With the exception of the 'Rescue Me' from this album, I think that they should have at least had a vocalist, a male or female, who could have added a little more energy to the songs. I recommend that they come out with a full album where they can have a strong voice and an exciting and strong vocal performance.  I have only heard the album once and found it to be a disappointment.  I would not reccomend it to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is good, but is not as good as the others I have owned in the past. They have a lot of pop-oriented songs on this CD, but they don't really have a voice.  I just think they could have a little more energy and the songs could be a little more interesting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It is a classic rock album.  I am a fan of the Beatles, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and of course, The Beatles.  It is a great album and one of my favorites.  It is a great rock album, but there are not too many songs on it that are the best.  There are some good songs on here, but there are also some that don't really grab you.  The vocals are ok, but there isn't much else to them.  I would say that this is a good album for fans who like the Beatles.  I think the Beatles have gone down the road of over-simplifying their music and this album is proof of that.  I love the songs on this album.  They are great.  This album is a great one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A classic album.  I love this album.  I don't know if I am a fan of 'The Beatles' because I am not a Beatles fan, but this album is one of my favorites.  I love the songs, the vocals are great, the production is great, and the band is great.  I am a Beatles fan, but this is one of my favorites.  Don't know if I will purchase this album again, but I will most likely order another copy.  I would recommend this album for any Beatles fan who wants to own a classic Album.  I think the songs are good, but they are not the best.  I would say that this is a good album for fans of the Beatles.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The Beatles: Back to the Egg is a great album and a great Beatles album.  This album shows that The Beatles were never going to be a pop band. This album shows that they never really had a single voice even though they have a vocal line.  The songs are great and the vocals are great.  This album is a classic album.

Amazon review: I should have just bought the one song that I liked. The 3 songs on the radio are the only ones that are worth a S*, the rest of the album sucks. Which was quite surprising and disappointing coming from Katy Perry. I would recommend others to only buy the songs they like. and leave the rest.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I became quite a fan of Otto Bekker after his "Sitar & Electronics" work. I've tried to find other recordings by Okko that might be similar in style. So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy. For all I know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: In what way is this good? It sounds like the soundtrack to a bad 90's movie. And I'm not talking about the actual music, it sounds like 80's pop music.

Amazon review: This is by far my favorite song on the album (and probably the one I'll listen to the most). I don't think it's all bad, but I do have some issues with the drumming (maybe the low to mid range sounds too much like a drum machine, rather than a drum kit). I also think the vocals are better on this song, and the song has no problems. Also, the lyrics are good, especially when you listen to it as a whole.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I would say the best of the album, but I would say that every song is good on the album. Even the songs with less good lyrics (the ones I didn't like) are still good. To me, Otto Bekker is a very talented musician.

Excellent album, but not as good as you would expect from Otto Bekker. I will stick to the live Zepp. But Otto Bekker is one of the best musicians I have ever heard.

Can't get in to this pop deluxe stuff. Some of the rave reviews puzzle me. This cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it. Not trying to say Jewel should stay confined but, just because record sales are "lagging" a bit, does that mean an artist has to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything Jewel seemed to want to tell us to rise above?

What We Learned

We've been playing the guitar for almost 20 years. We've learned that sometimes it takes a while before you perfect something, and sometimes it takes years.

We've learned a lot in those years.

We've learned about a few tools in addition to the fingers. We've learned that all the tools we used when learning the guitar, even though they were great at their time, were not good enough.

We've learned about the mistakes we have made.

We've learned that you

Amazon review: It's totaly amazing that this was created. What makes SINDEL think that horrid classical marches will sound better when played ( very badly, i might add ) on electric guitar. The tones he uses are more annoying then a cat fight under your bedroom window. This is totaly unlistenable garbage that has no merrit whatsoever. This might well be the worst cd I've ever bought. I hope this will be the total extent of SINDEL's musical offerings. PUTRID!

Amazon review: I'm a BIG Van Halen fan. but. this live album is a lttle too late. Dave, Dave, Dave. wassup?  He had it together for the initial reunion tour, but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career. He no longer seems interested in SINGING the lyrics, but rather talking, and mumbling his way through them. Although not 100%. he still has the chops if he chooses to use them. his very recent Foo Fighters appearance singing Panama, shows he can do better.

Amazon review: I feel that this song is very much a parody of the Christian music genre. It's a song that was created to make fun of all the Christian music that has come before it. The song itself is very unoriginal as it's nothing more than a repetition of what a song like "My Eyes" would have sounded like.

### The Bible

The Holy Bible, the inspired word of God, is the only complete and sufficient guide for all Christians. It is the Word of God, written in the original languages of the Jews and from the original languages of the nations of the world.

It was written by men who studied the languages and cultures of men, and who wrote down what they had heard in the natural languages of men.

The Bible was first written down by the Apostle Paul in the first century, when Christianity was still a small group of churches.

All Christians believe in the Bible as the Word of God and that it is the only complete, and sufficient guide to life, ministry, and worship for all Christians.

The consonant words are the sounds we make with our mouths. For example, the consonant words in the Hebrew language are: sh, ch, and s.

The vowel words are the sounds we make with our lips. For example, the vowels in the Hebrew language are: a, e, i, o, u, and uv.

Amazon review: A very enjoyable and fun listen. I have some favorite songs on there, but they are still in my rotation. I have heard this album on a couple of different occasions.

One of the best is the title track. The last song on this album is my favorite, and the one where you really hear it. I give this album a 4-star rating.

Amazon review: This was released in 1991, so it has not aged well. You would have to be listening to it right now to notice. It is by far the most boring album of the year. The first track is great, but doesn't do much for the album. It is a shame that the last song is the same every song. The title track is excellent, but the next song is the worst on the album, and the one after that (the last song) is a ripoff of the title track. The song "The Legend" is the only song that I really like, but this album is a boring mess of mediocre material. I give this album a 2-star rating.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: In the late 1970s, this was the best thing going, but now, it is just a one-trick pony. This is not really country or bluegrass, it is just banjo and pedal steel. There are a couple of good songs on there, but these are the most memorable ones. The worst song on the album is "Doyle Lawson." I don't know why it is called "Doyle Lawson" for a banjo player. I don't know why the title is the last "The" on the album. I don't have a good explanation for why it is there. It is just filler.

Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.

Amazon review: What's wrong with record companies these days?  Everytime you turn around there is yet another "greatest hits", "ultimate", "essential", "box set" or "whatever" hits package that basically consist of all the same songs, give or take one or two exceptions.  This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.  What's up with Amy anyway?  What audience is she trying to speak to?  Her old "christian" audience, "pop" audience, "adult comtemporaray" audience, all of them?

Amazon review: The "A-List" is a compilation that came out a couple months ago.  The compilation is actually a series of compilation albums by various artists.  I bought this album because it was listed as a "A-list" compilation, and I was curious.  It's basically just a compilation of the singles that were released by the various artists.  Although it's a compilation, it still has a lot of songs on there, including the one Amy is a part of.  The disc is a 2 disc set that has 5 songs that are all originals.  I really liked the sound of the album, but I don't know if Amy is a part of it.  It's a compilation.  It feels like it's just the same songs over and over, like a song on a "hit mix tape."  All five songs are original songs.  All five songs are very good by Amy's standards.  Amy's voice is great, though.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Amy's voice is great.  She doesn't use a lot of effects, and she tries to keep her voice simple.  Even though the songs sound simple, if you've ever listened to radio or seen a video, you know that they're not.  The lyrics are simple, and they have the same basic meaning.  The lyrics are not complex, and Amy's voice just sounds natural.  It's just Amy.  It's like listening to a normal human.  The only thing that makes this album is Amy's voice.  The CD's are nice looking, but the songs are bland.  The songs sound as if Amy sang them, not as if they were made by someone else.  I just don't feel like this is a good enough reason to buy it.

Amazon review: This is "The Amy Winehouse Collection."  I know it's not technically a compilation, but it's still a collection of all of her songs, with one of them being "Solo."  This is a great album.  I own "Winehouse" and "Solo," and I can't remember the other songs.  I wish Amy would pick songs that she really liked, like "The River" and "It's Not Easy."  I don't think I could handle hearing "The River" every night for the rest of my life.  The songs on this album sound like they really meant something to Amy.  I think this is a fine album.  It's not a great album, but it's a fine album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't know what Amy is trying to say with this record.  I don't think this CD is even a collection of Amy's songs.  There are three songs on here that are Amy's songs.  They are "Blonde", "Solo", and "The River."  "The River" is not only Amy's song, but it's Amy's only song.  "Blonde" is a song that's been on every radio station in the world, including Radiohead, in its entirety.  She's been singing the song for about 7 years, so I think it's a great song.  "Solo" is a song Amy wrote after she wrote "Blonde."  "The River" is Amy's song, but it's also a song that Radiohead wrote.  I think Amy is trying to say that she doesn't have to make a record or write a song.  She doesn't have to make a record or write a song.  I think Amy wants to give Radiohead a chance to play "The River" after it's played all over the world.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Amy's song "The River" is played only once on Radiohead's "OK Computer."  It's a great song, but it's not a "hit" song.  It's just a song, and it's not a hit song.  The song was written in about 7 years, and it's still a great song.  It's a song that Amy said she wanted to write after "Blonde."  If it weren't for "Blonde," I don't think Amy would have written another song since "The River."  This is a good album, but it's not a great album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am sure this album will become a staple in my music collection.  I love all of the songs, however I would have liked to have at least one more track by the songwriter, I don't know if he is alive or if he has died, this is his most popular song, and I like to hear it over and over.  I would also like to see a second CD released of holiday favorites and other songs by this artist.

Amazon review: I did hear this song on the radio and it sounded like an oldies song to me, so I bought it.  I put it on my iPod and it was good, so I just put it on my hard drive.  Then I tried to delete it, but it said it was in use.  I tried to delete it, but it wouldn't let me, saying I needed the music program that comes with my iPod to do it.  This made me mad so I took the hard drive out of my computer because it was going to take hours to get back in there.  Then I put it in my other computer because that was the only computer I had.  It started playing on the other computer, but I kept hearing it on the iPod.  I don't know why it's playing on the other computer, but it didn't give me the option to "turn off" the old computer, so I deleted the iPod by accident.  Now I can't hear it on my iPod.  The only way I can get it back is to use iTunes.

Amazon review: I remembered this song one day. and began researching it online. My flate ather once owned the vinyl record. He frequently played different genres of music music around the house. I grew up loving all kinds of music. I have not heard this song since childhood. The vinyl record of course is lost now. This digital song was sung by much the same/similar original artist I'd listened to growing up. It brought back wonderful memories of happy childhood days.
