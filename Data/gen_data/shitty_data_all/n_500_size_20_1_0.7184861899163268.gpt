Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I really don't know what to say about this album.  It's very basic - as far as I'm concerned - and I don't know what to think.  What I do know is that I like it, and I'm not sure how much I regret having bought this album.  I don't like it at all.  I don't even know how to describe it.  I can't even think of a single song that I will ever love again.  I don't know what the hype is all about.  I like it, but I don't like it.  I can't see myself listening to this again.  It's just not for me.  I'm sorry, but it's just not.

Amazon review: It's a Christmas album that will be remembered for all the wrong reasons.  First and foremost, it's a Christmas album that is very poorly produced.  It's a CD that has been released to compete with the same-old Christmas songs.  The only interesting thing about this CD is that it has a couple of Christmas songs that are very good.  The only thing it has going for it is that it's a Christmas album, and that's something that most people will take for granted.  The only reason it even makes it to my top ten on Amazon is that the majority of the songs are Christmas songs, and therefore, I feel like the songs have to be good.  In all honesty, even if I gave this album 1 star, I wouldn't give it a second glance.  I don't know why I even bothered to buy it.  I guess I wanted to see if this disc would make any difference in my ranking of Christmas CDs.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band for years.  This is the first Christmas album that I have purchased.  I was disappointed with the album.  The album is very generic, and has nothing that I would call "Christmas".  The only "Christmas" song I can remember from this album is "Christmas Is A Wonderful Time To Be Alive".  The only other good song is "The Christmas Song" from the Christmas album.  The rest are very generic.  I only have a few bad things to say about this album.  I have a couple of good things to say.  The worst thing about this album is that it is a Christmas album.  That's it.  I don't care what the song is about.

"I had a few different ideas for songs," Reznor said. "I was kind of waiting to see if I could pull something out and if I could do it, then I knew I could do it. I always felt like there was something more to do. There's nothing like opening yourself up to someone else and letting them have the control. I thought that would be cool to write a song.

It's difficult to explain with a story, but I feel that this story is very relevant to how we treat animals who are abused, mistreated, and neglected by their human families.

I really liked this album and was waiting for the new one to come out. I really liked the music in this album, I think it was one of the best of the year, but I'm disappointed with the new one. I really like the new one more than the old one. I think it's great.

Amazon review: This is my favorite of the new albums. This album is great and I love the songs. It has a great beat and I especially like the songs "Beach" and "Come Back". The only thing I would have changed is the songs on it were too long. This is my favorite song, in my opinion.

In your file you have:
1,2,3               2

              9,10,11   11
              12,13,14   15

The 6,7,8 are integers that you want to convert to strings. We will need the ASCII number of the character in the range 0-255, so we will use the following formula:

Ascii (char c) = (1 << c) + (1<<(c+1)) + (1<<(c+2)) +... 

For your example you will get:

Ascii(6) = 65 + 65 + 65 + 65 = 325 = 9
Ascii(7)  = 57 + 57 + 57 = 211 = 1
Ascii(8)  = 45 + 45 + 45 = 225 = 5

We can now use these values in the following formula

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The band is still a huge hit with me.  I still can't believe I listened to a lot of their albums, and I can listen to every track on this CD in under a couple of hours.  The songs are brilliant and I love the album.  The lead guitar man on the debut album was one of the best things that have happened to me in the past.  The other songs were just filler.  I don't like the sound of the songs on the second album.  I liked the first album's cover art, and the second album's cover art is terrible.  I love the album art, but I don't like the album's cover art.  The album is overrated and I don't like the style of the songs.  I don't like the music, and I don't like Josh.  I gave the CD a 5.  I don't think I will ever buy this album again, and I gave it a 5.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a huge fan of this music.  I mean, the first disc is alright, but nothing particularly remarkable.  This CD is just a collection of boring songs that don't stand out for me.  If you're looking for an album with more than a couple of gems, then this isn't your CD.  I don't really like this album but I'm not a big fan.  I don't like the production of the songs.  I don't like the songs, and I don't like Josh.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: This album is a must have for those who love music and need a little break from listening to the radio all day.  I can only listen to 2 songs off this album.  The first song was an excellent song and the second song was a very catchy pop song, but, I love the first song and can't listen to the second song.

Amazon review: In the early days of rock music when the Beatles were doing their thing, the music industry was going through serious financial difficulties.  The record companies had over-spent in the 1950's, and they were just trying to survive the music they created.  It was then they had the idea of re-releasing their catalogs.  The idea was that the people who really liked the music could buy the songs and the record companies would make money.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I wanted to have some of the best songs that I loved from The Beatles and to listen to their music in a way they never did previously.  The problem is that I don't like the songs very much and I think that the only reason I bought this album was to listen to them.  I had to give it up because I don't like it at all.

Amazon review: "The album was very exciting, it was the best music since The Beatles.  The Beatles were like our family, and this album was like having our own family.  We could relate to all the songs and their stories, and when we left our families to go off to school we knew we were in good hands."

Amazon review: This is the biggest mistake that I've made in my life.  I bought this album because I wanted to be a part of the Beatles' legacy.  I wanted to be the next Paul McCartney or John Lennon.  I was convinced that this was the only way I could keep up.  But this album has turned out to be the biggest mistake of my life.  I have lost the love of my life, my dad, and I'm not even sure why.

Amazon review: This is another great Beatles album.  It is a good album.  It has a lot of good songs, a lot of good music, but there is a problem.  The best songs are not on this album.  The only songs on this album that I can stand is "The Long and Winding Road" and "I'm So Tired."  Both of these songs are great.  The other songs are good, but not as great as the songs on the other albums.  Overall, though I like this album, I don't think it is as good as many people think it is.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat.

The album was decent for the price, but if I wanted a decent album, I would have bought one of the other albums to go with it.

Amazon reviews: This is a very good, but pretty boring album. I don't think the songs are all that good, but I don't really like the sound of the music on this album.

Amazon review: This is my favorite album of yours. I have gotten several other albums, but this one is by far my favorite. It has a very unique sound and I love it. I own the whole album.

I know a lot of people are complaining about the songs on here, but I love them all. They are all different from one another. The song "I Love This Song" is my favorite. I would recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: I bought my first album, "The Head and the Heart," about a year and a half ago. It was my first purchase on Amazon and I was pleasantly surprised. I have since purchased several albums by this band and I have yet to find any that compare to the quality of the Head and the Heart! I love the variety of music that this band has to offer. Some of the songs are great, but many are "not-so-great." I can't wait to hear more from this band.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review:[Lyrics]
I love you, with a passion
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
You're in my heart, and I can't get out
I love you, with a passion
I love you, I need you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I miss you so much, I'm so sorry
But I can't get out
I love you, with a passion
You're in my heart, and I can't get out
You're in my heart, and I can't get out
And I miss you so much, I'm so sorry
But I can't, I can't get out
I love you, with a passion

I have a birthday coming up, so I thought I would have a present for my two year old daughter that would make her laugh. I thought about using a sock puppet to do a dance with her. But instead I found the following song on youtube. My daughter sings it with me and my husband. It is the perfect song for her to sing on her birthday. I hope she likes it.
