Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I don't have much to say.  I am very upset because I would like to have a relationship with this singer.  Oh well, I guess I'll just have to wait to find out who she is in person.  I'm still really interested in the new CD.  I like the music.  I just don't like the album cover, it's just too "cute"  It looks like all of her album covers have been in one place.

Amazon review: I really liked this album  I mean I am a fan of her songs and I think this album has a lot of her best songs in there.  But, her voice is just too high pitched.

Amazon review: I'm a real fan of songwriter/singer Meghan Trainor.  When I was a kid, I was obsessed with her.  I love that she is a lesbian.  I think it's cool.  I love the fact that she wrote a song for me that was exactly what I needed to hear at the time.  I don't want to be a lesbian anymore, but I do know that I would like to be with someone that I can be comfortable with and be with all the time.  I just want to be happy and be with whoever I love.

Amazon review: I love the song, "All of Me".  I especially liked the lyrics.  It expresses my feelings much better than some of the other songs I've heard on this album.  It's just the lyrics, not the singing, that impress me.  The song is a little slow at first, but it picks up in the second half.  It's a really, really good song.  I hope that they will release another song on the album like "All of Me".  I like it.  I wish there was a better song with the lyrics.

Amazon review: I like the song, "All of Me".  I especially liked the lyrics, so much better than some of the other songs I've heard on this album, that just don't seem to have the same meaning.  It's just the lyrics, not the singing, that impresses me.  The song is a little slow at first, but it builds up a lot faster than some of the other songs on the album.  It's a really, really good song.  I hope they release another song with the same exact lyrics, so it can be a double CD.  It's my favorite song on the album.  I love it, it's a really good song.  I hope they release another song with the same lyrics on the next album.

Amazon review: This song was the first in the box.  The first one was one that was not the original version that was recorded by the band, it was remakes of the other albums.

I don't like listening to any female singer who is singing without looking at the music or looking at the music.  It makes me feel like I'm not in the room.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I bought my cd's a few months ago.  I was in a good mood.  I was looking for a good CD to relax with.  I bought this cds and put it on.  I did not know what  to expect.  I got it in a plain brown sleeve and that's all I know about it.  I have one CD already and it is great.  I think it's a better CD than the first one.  I will buy this CD again.  I will buy it again and again.  I will bring this CD to a band that is not big.  I will bring this CD to a band that is small and not good.  I hope this CD is better than the rest, because as I said it is not a big CD.  I will buy it again.  You have a good CD.  You are a good artist.  Keep up the good work.  I am going to buy more CD's from you.  You have a good cd.  Keep up the good work.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: My cd was the only CD I bought in my life.  I only had it for a couple of months and after I finished I had no more money to buy anything else and  was broke so I gave it to charity.

For me, the only reason to buy a CD is if it is a good one.

A:

I can't believe I just wentogled this. I'm sure it'll pop up in various searches.
I have a hard time hearing the lyrics on this CD. They're not really understandable. The vocalist's voice doesn't have a ring to it. I guess it could be because I have a bad ear for music, or maybe the songwriters didn't do a good job of creating the lyrics.
I don't really have an opinion about this CD, but here it is anyway.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I heard this CD for the first time on the radio and I thought, "Man, this is great.  But it's kind of boring."  I've been playing it non-stop for the last few days and I think it's even better than I first thought.    I've tried it with the radio on and off and I can't remember when I was more into music.  It has been a great day.  I play my guitar in the shower, in the car, in the grocery store, on the bus, in the car, and I've even taken it out on the street, by myself.  This album is a must for guitar playing, for any music lover.  I recommend them both.    If you want guitar play, I highly recommend this album.

Amazon review:  Music is the best way to express my feelings.  I first heard the songs on the radio, and I thought, "Man, the song is so great.  This is the best song I've heard in years!"  After listening to the entire album, I realized that I was wrong.    The second song on the album, "A Place For My Dad" is just plain sad.  I can't imagine what it would be like to live with your father all the time, being stuck in a tiny apartment with a small kitchen and living room.    I really enjoyed "I'm Crying" and "The Girl Inside."  They are just wonderful.      I also really love the music that these three guys do.  The music is the best part of the CD, and I have to say, I am amazed by how the CD gets better with each listen.  I've listened to every song on the CD more than once, and I can't wait to listen to them again.                If you would like some great music to listen to, I would highly recommend this CD.

Amazon review: This is one of the greatest albums that I have ever heard.     I have been listening to this album on my stereo system for the last two hours and I will continue to listen to it for as long as I can.    It's a wonderful blend of music and lyrics.  I've played this CD so much that I have even started to play it on my guitar.  I like to think that I am really good at my guitar playing, but I know that I am not, and it is very frustrating, because I think that I should be.    This album just makes me want to play guitar for the rest of my life.    I would recommend this album to any and everyone.

Amazon review: The album is a mixture of original songs and cover songs.  This album is a great listen, but I would like to see the band do a third (or fourth) CD, with original material only.

"Shoot the Moon"

The first song that I heard when this CD was released was "Shoot the Moon" and I love that song. I love to hear Jewel sing it. It's one of the best songs that I ever heard on CD. The lyrics are really sad. Very powerful and it's so beautiful, I just love the way it is sung. I really like the song and I hope that she wins some of the awards for that song.

"Shoot the Moon"

I do have a problem with Jewel's voice. I think that her voice is not very good. It is not like her voice is like Whitney Houston, because she has a little deeper voice. She is not like LaShawn or Britney. She has a sweet but not very good voice.

This CD is very good. She has talent. I do like her voice. The song "Shoot the Moon" is one of the songs that I really like. It is very powerful. I like that song the most. I was really surprised by this CD. I really like her voice.

I love the music, but the song "Shoot the Moon" in particular is one of my favorite songs she has ever sung. It's one of the best songs that I've ever heard. I love to listen to it over and over and over. I'm very very picky about my music. I like every one of Jewel's CD's. I like the CD's.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I had been looking very long and hard for the right hymn to sing at church.  I found this one on Amazon.  I was very impressed.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: A great CD, although the tracks are a bit repetitive. I like the diversity of music.

Amazon review: If there was one thing I did not like about it, it was that it was all a bit too polished. I felt as though a lot of the songs were being cut and pasted together. Still, I can't complain too much as it is well worth the $13.

Amazon review: the lyrics and musical styles were very interesting, and the cd is a very good example of how one may go about making a CD. I have heard some people claim that all great artists have similar styles, but that is not necessarily true. I do not know how much of the CD is actually Jewel's original compositions and how much is "pop music" which is a generic term. The cd is a very creative work, and I look forward to listening to it again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know if it is good or bad, but I have never heard a cd that sounded so good. I listened to it before and after work, and it was like I had a new music in my head and the cd was a reminder of what I had just heard. My only criticism, and I found this cd to be the best of those that I have purchased, is that it would be nice if it was a little more consistent in the music. I could listen to this all day long without getting bored. Great cd!!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Twiztid was one of the only bands of the 90's that I liked. I was lucky enough to see them live in 1993 at the Roxy in New York City. The show was great, but I wasn't impressed with Twiztid. Now that I have heard their new album, I'm really disappointed.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the first Twiztid album I have ever bought. I was excited to get it, but when I looked at the cover and saw that it was a re-issue, I felt deflated and not really wanting to buy it. A new CD would have been nice. It's not horrible; it's not even really bad. But it is lacking.  I feel like all the songs were recorded in a day.  It's not like the first two albums, when the songs were recorded in the studio. This album is very sparse. The songs are very short. The album is very well-produced. The whole album sounds like it was recorded in one day. It's great to hear that Twiztid is still going, but I just wish this album was better than it is.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really love this album. I think it is one of TwizTid's best. The first two albums were great, but this album is even better than the first two albums.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

And the whole song and the first part of the song and the first part of the song and the last part of the song. I guess Thalia should ask to be allowed back into the studio. I mean she is singing. And it is not just a little bit. It is a lot. A lot. And it is only a little bit. And it is only a little bit. And it is only a small amount. And it is only a little bit. And it is only a tiny portion of what she sings. But still I love it. And I want to have it. I want to own it. I want to have it. And to listen to it over and over and over and over again.
