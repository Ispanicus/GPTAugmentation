Amazon review: That is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased.  I will find something better.  Not worth it.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: I think it is all in how the recording is done, not in the recording itself.  My daughter is very happy with this CD.  If you are in the mood for a soothing piece of music, this is a great choice.  However, if you are into a song that will take your mind to a more relaxing, pleasant place, this CD is not for you.  I did not appreciate the CD at all.  The voice was very irritating and the music was very irritating.  It was like being stuck in a room with someone who had a bad cold for 10 days.  The CD is a waste of your money.  It is a waste of your time, as well.  It is really, really, really boring.  I would rather listen to a CD that I know has a good message.

Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: This song is just horrible. It is so bad that I'm going to have to start a petition to get it taken off the album. This song takes up the entire second half of the CD, so there's no reason for it to take up the entire album. It's just a really annoying song. I don't know why people keep buying this. It's just too short and boring.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I'm not a music lover but I am a fan of the Zac Brown Band.  However, I think their albums are too diverse to enjoy.  For example, I enjoy their most recent album "The Band's Christmas" but it is not what I would call "great" music.  I would say it is a good album for when you are sick or need something to pass the time.  But, there are quite a few other songs on this album that I feel are not worth repeating.  With this record, the band had to make a best-of album and I believe they did a good job.  It is a good album, just not the greatest.

Amazon review: I've heard this album a million times.  I have listened to it every single night since it came out.  I know its not the most popular album in the world but it is a good album.  I think it is a fun album.  The two new songs are good.  I like the songs on this album.  I didn't like the one song on the album that is called "I love my life" by the Zac Brown Band.  I think the song is terrible.  I don't like the Zac Brown Band.  I don't like their music.  I don't like their look.  They are not a very nice band.  They are a very good but not very good band.  I'm glad they are still doing good work.  The only good thing is that they are doing it in Nashville.  I hope you enjoy the album.  I wish they would start a country band again.  I think they would be a great band.  I would like to see them go back to their roots though.  I never liked the band.  I think they are just better than the country band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know why I bothered putting this on my "to listen" list...just didn't listen to it.  I will give it a chance but I'm very wary about buying anything from this artist.  The songs were just not very good and I think they should be stopped.  I don't know what the point of this album is.  It might be good for some people but I don't understand why they feel the need to put out this many songs.  They should stick to one song at a time.  I can't really enjoy this album.  I can't say I'm a big fan of the Zac Brown Band.  It's just not my type of music.  I would never buy anything from this band.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Zac Brown Band and this is their strongest album to date.  The songs are all very strong and the album is very enjoyable.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the first three Korn albums, and I love the first three albums of every other band.  I love the music, but I don't love any of the albums.  However, I think this one is excellent.  The lyrics are the best I've ever had the pleasure of listening to in a long time.  Some say it's the best Korn album ever.  The album is full of great songs.  I don't say that lightly.  I was amazed at the maturity and maturity of the lyrics, and I thought that was a good thing.  I'm a huge fan of the songwriting of Trent and Gary, and the song "Gates of Fire" reminded me of a lot of songs that I've loved from Korn and from the other bands I listen to.  But the album works on so many levels.  I was totally blown away by the lyrics.  They are just so, so good.  And it's a good thing that the first Korn album was so good.  I loved that album, too.  So when I heard this one, I was looking for something I knew I'd like, and I really liked it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like it.  It's great.  The album is much better than the previous one.  I think the two albums Korn made with David Lee Roth were some of the best Korn albums of all time.  If you can get past the first half of the album, this one is great.  And the first half is really good.  I'm glad I bought it.  It's a very good album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I know it's not really a "best of" album, but it's not a bad album either.  The songs are very good, and the drumming is good.  Even Trent's voice is great, and it's great to see a new guitar player.  I like the way he does the solos.  The keyboards sound really good, too.  But the lyrics are what makes the album great.  The first half of the album is great, and then the second half is where I really like it.  The second half is where I can say it's a good album, and still be happy with it.  But it's the best Korn album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an excellent album.  It's hard to believe that Korn is actually a four-piece band.  The songs are very good.  The vocals are really good.  The drumming is very good.  Trent and Gary are at their best here.  And the guitar playing is pretty good.  I find the album to be very hard to put down.  I still like the first half, but I'm really starting to enjoy the second half a lot more.  I was a little hesitant to buy this one because I thought it was going to be a one-album deal, but I'm glad I did.  It's an excellent album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am really excited about the new album.  This one is a step above the last album, and I love everything about this one.  However, the new album is not the best Korn album either.  I think the first half of this album is excellent.  The second half is good, but not as good as the first half.  The first half is much better than the second half, which is good, but not as good as the first half.  I really like the song "Grievance."  I love the guitars.  I love the drums.  I love the keyboards.  I

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: I have never been a huge Death Cab fan, but this song really gets to me.  It is not a song I would normally listen to but I do.  It is so dark and foreboding and sounds like a great movie score.  It has a great beat and is very well done.

If you are an avid Death Cab fan, you will have to be prepared to have your hopes shattered.  The only reason why I continued to read the reviews, was because I was hoping to read some positive words.  As it turns out, the new album is not going to be a good one and I am beginning to see why.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Death Cab since my teenage years.  The original band has always been my favorite Death Cab cover band.  The new Death Cab for Life album and the re-release of their first album on vinyl was a life-changing moment for me.  I was very disappointed to find out that the new album was more like a compilation of songs and that it did not have as much interest for me as the other albums the original Death Cab has released.  The new album is a good album and I am still a fan of Death Cab, but I am beginning to see why I stopped listening to them.

Amazon review:"Death Cab for Life" is not music for the masses.  It is music for fans and a rare opportunity for those who want to hear music from the original artist with a new arrangement.  With this album, you get a mix of songs from the Death Cab's first three albums in addition to other songs.  The songs on this album are not as well done as the original Death Cab albums.  The production is not as good and there is not as much energy as the original Death Cab albums.  The production is good for an original artist, but there are too many songs and not enough of them are good.  The songs on this album are also a little bit too slow without the energy of the original Death Cab albums.  I think this album will be good, but not great.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

[Amazon 1st:] I bought this CD when it was released.  It was supposed to be a "Bass and Soul" album and I'm really into that genre.  But, I'm getting a lot of "What are you listening to this for?" from my friends and family.  I'm happy with the CD, but wish I'd just bought the original albums.  The cover art doesn't do it justice. I think the original bands are better artists.  The remix does.  The original songs are better.  But, it's a $25 CD.  If you can find a CD with the original artists on it for half that price, you might want to give it a shot.  I actually like the songs on this CD better than the remixes.
[Amazon 2nd:] I have a few friends who are big fans of the original artists.  I gave this CD to one of my friends and he ended up buying some of the artists albums.  He really likes the remixes.  The songs are well written.  I think the original artists are better artists.  If you like the remixes, you might as well get the originals.  They are better.
[Amazon 3rd:] Great album.  I bought this CD because it was on sale for $2.99.  I could have gotten it for $5.  I don't really care for the remixes.  They don't have much to do with the original bands.  If you like the original artists, you might as well get the originals.  They are better.  I like the original artists better.

If you like the original artists, you might as well get all of them.  They're better.  I like the original artists better than the remixes.  But, they're not worth $25.
[Amazon 7th:] I bought this CD because it was on sale for $2.99, and I thought it would be worth it.  I can't really remember what the songs I liked are.  I'm pretty sure it was a mix of old and new songs, but I can't remember.  I still like the original artists better.
[Amazon 8th:] I bought this CD because it was on sale for $3.  I have to say, I think it was better than the originals.  I think they're better artists.  If you like the original artists, you might as well give them the originals.  They're better.  I like the original artists better.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I don't like the Beatles. I don't really like many of the songs they covered. And the rest of their songs are lame. I also don't like their costumes. And their music is boring. And the Beatles are old. And their concerts are lame. And their personalities are lame. So I don't really like them.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of The Beatles during the '60s and '70s, and I was a big fan of The Beach Boys in the '70s.  As a child in the '80s, I discovered The Beatles and The Beach Boys and became a huge fan of both.  I was at a show in Atlanta when I heard The Beatles, and it was a life changing experience.  I was 16 years old, and it changed my life.  I went to the concert with my dad and I was not only disappointed in the quality of the sound, but I realized that I was not a teenager anymore.  I was a grown man.  I was a fan of music.  I wanted to be a fan of music, and I wanted to have the ability to buy music I truly loved.  I bought the CD in Atlanta and listened to it over and over again.  I bought every Beatles album I could find, and then I discovered The Beach Boys.  It was like a songbook.  I had a passion for The Beach Boys and The Beatles and I had to have it.  I had to have the original albums.  I had to have the remastered editions.  I couldn't just go to the store and buy it.  It was not available.  The CDs were released with the songs in the original mix.  There was no way to hear it properly.  It was just too expensive.  It was no longer available.  It was gone.  And I was pissed.  I was pissed that it was gone.  I didn't have any money to buy it.  I needed it.  I needed the songs.  I had to have it.  I had to have it.  So, I bought it.  I bought it from a friend of mine who was a big fan of The Beatles and The Beach Boys.  He knew I had a passion for both of these groups and he knew I was not happy to see them go.  He knew I wanted the complete albums with the songs in the original mix.  He told me to go to eBay.  I wanted a great deal on this one.  I wanted very cheap.  He told me to go to eBay, and I put in a bid.  I put in a $25 bid.  I wanted a great deal, and I got a great deal.  I got the first CD in the series, and I was beyond happy.  I heard the songs on the CD in the original mix, and I heard the songs on the CD in the remastered version.  I was beyond happy.  I was happy that I had the original albums.  I had the first three albums in the series.  I had the first two albums in the series.  I had the Beatles 1, The Beatles 2,  The Beatles Anthology,  The Beach Boys 1, The Beach Boys 2.  I had the first three albums in the series.  I also had the second three albums,  The Beach Boys 2,  The Beach Boys 3,  The Beach Boys 4,  The Beach Boys Anthology.  So, I had all the albums.  I could get these original albums at the store. It was fantastic.  So, I made an eBay account.  I got the first album in the series for $13.  I got the second album for $15.  I got the third album for $20.  I got the second album in the series for $16.  I had the first three albums in the series and I had the first two albums in the series.  I had the first three albums in the series.  I was beyond pleased.  I was beyond happy.  I was happy to see that it was there.  I was beyond pleased that the Beatles and The Beach Boys were not gone.  I was beyond happy that it was there.  I was beyond pleased to have these original albums.  Every one has a different feel and sound.  Every one is different.  I could hear the difference.  I could hear the difference on the original albums.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

The only thing I would suggest is that the songs be sung in a more natural tone, like in a barbershop quartet.  But I think that that is something that you can change easily.  Overall, a great album.
