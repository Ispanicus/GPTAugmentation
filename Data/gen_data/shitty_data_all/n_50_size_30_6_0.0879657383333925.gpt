Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:: This album is not bad. The lyrics are good, the music is still good. The only thing I don't like is the "Lose Yourself" song, which is my least favorite. I find that Eminem's lyrics are not necessarily the best. I am hoping for some more rapping on his next album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Thalia was the first Latina to earn a Grammy nomination for a Latin Album of the Year.  I was there, and I don't think I ever saw anyone do what she did.  The Latin roots of her music are so rich that even a little bit of it would have been better than not having any at all.  But, she would have been far better off if she hadn't done it.  And, to be honest, she isn't even Latin.  Her music is influenced by a few of the more Latin-influenced artists, but is rooted in the blues, and the blues is rooted in the blues.  So, it's hard for me to understand how she could have done this.  It's not as if the blues, or at least the style of blues, is some kind of foreign import.  Yet, I have never heard a latino musician who could do what Thalia has done.  She is a genius at her craft.  I am glad she is a part of the blues and not the mainstream.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not going to lie but this is probably one of the worst albums I've purchased in the last year or so.  I have to admit when I first started hearing this album I thought it really sounded like The Strokes or The Smiths, and then I realized its not even that.  It's just nothing.  The songs are all the same formulaic songs with only random hooks and not really anything happening.  The lyrics are stupid, boring and poorly written.  I really don't see the point to this recording.  I have a few different albums that I really hate but this one makes me angry.  Now that I have this feeling let me just list all the things that I don't like about this album...
1.)  The lyrics are all the same.  It's just a bunch of words people put together to fit the concept of the song.  No real meaning.  It's just a bunch of words.  I mean I don't mind reading poetry or poetry but the lyrics on this album are not anything.  The best thing about this album is the song "B.L.U.S.S."  I have never heard a song with lyrics like this.  It's just stupid.  It has no real meaning or feeling.  The song is about the band and the name of the band, and then it talks about what the band stands for.  I don't understand the point of this song.  It sounds like a group of idiots.  I don't know if the band has a name or if they just named themselves "B.L.U.S.S." because people are idiots.  It makes no sense.  I don't understand how anyone would name something like this.  I don't get it.  I'm not trying to be rude but this is just a bunch of words that are supposed to mean something.  I just don't understand what it is supposed to mean.  I'm sorry if I offend anybody but this just means nothing.  Now I can't even listen to the songs on this album because I just don't know what to think of it.  I like the idea of the band but the lyrics mean nothing to me.  The lyrics are just stupid.  The band sounds like idiots.  I'm sorry.  I just don't like this album at all.  I would give it a 1 if it weren't for the stupid lyrics and the stupid band.

If you don't think that Lil' Shout is a good song or a good album then just don't listen to it.  All I can say is that I enjoyed this album because at the beginning the songs were great and then the songs got old.  The next song "Rock The Party" is very good.  The band is good, the lead singer is great and all the songs are very good.  The album gets better and better.  This album is the best of the last 6 months.  It was the best music I have heard in the past year.  Now this has to be the last review because I feel like I can't just review this album anymore.  I'm going to go back and listen to it again...and then I can't do it again.  I want to say that this is the best album that has been released in the past 6 months.  I think the only album that can match this album is The Killers' "I Am The Highway" (which is also not bad).  This album is not bad.  I think this is a good album.  It

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I'm a total fan of the band so far.  I have a ton of songs and love the fact that they have the same kind of sound as early T.I. except they use more guitars and are much more aggressive.

Amazon review: This is actually one of his best albums.  I have had my doubts about him, since his early days, and I have always felt he had more potential than he showed.  Unfortunately, it seems he was not able to realize the potential he had, hence the lackluster efforts of the last few albums.  This album is a return to form, but not the one they had hoped for.  Still, he is one of my favorite producers and I look forward to his next project.

Amazon review: I think this is a great album, there are just a few tracks which I find to be weak, but overall it's a very good album.  I don't know what his problem is, but I think he needs to keep writing music.  If he keeps writing music, he will get better, his music will improve and he can take things to the next level.   And if I wanted to be a Twiztid fan, I would buy this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review  The song has been on my iPod for a couple weeks now and I still can't get over how horrible it is.  I was going to buy it for my kids, but decided against it.  They will be able to listen to it when they are older, so I don't think they need to hear it now.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I like this CD, but I don't like the singing voice and the music.  I don't like the fact that she's not singing any of the songs in the order I like them, like A Very Special Christmas.  I don't know why, but I would like the rest of the CD to be more upbeat.

Amazon review: This is a positive gift for those who love to sing.  I like the lyrics and the music and the voice.  I am very proud of my ability to sing.  My husband has been singing in his church choir for years.  He is usually the "lead" singer.  He would love to have me join him.  I am very grateful for all I have.  I just don't sing very well in the shower.  I don't like the sound of my voice and it doesn't work well with the music.  I do like the CD.  I have a very good voice, but I don't like the singing.  I do like the music.

Amazon review: I bought this CD and am absolutely in love.  I already have the CDs that are the same time, but I love Cyney's voice and this CD is definitely worth it.  I already listen to her CD and this one is even better.  I love the song 'If' and the fact that she chose the song.

She does not sing the songs I choose in the order I would like them to be sung, but I still love listening to her sing.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just heard this cd.  It's nice but in the end it just didn't do it for me.  I just didn't like it.  I tried to find a way to find more of his stuff but didn't find anything.  It's like he went away from this world.  He just didn't sing the songs that he should have.  They were all just songs about someone, the love of the singer or someone who loved him.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not familiar with this artist but this is really good.  It's just so refreshing to hear someone sing their own music, not the same tired stuff they are singing now.  It's a good album.  I have a feeling that this is the last recording that he will do.  There's no recording of him doing this here on the internet.  Even if you find something you can buy it is still going to be a pricey CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I know this artist, but can't find his name on Wikipedia.  I wanted to buy his CD, it was on a sale so I bought it.  But when I listened to it,  the whole album is just the same song over and over.  I can't stand listening to it.  It's really boring.  I'm not sure what's going on with this guy, he's doing it for so much money, but he can just turn it off, I don't understand why he doesn't do anything else but the same songs over and over.  It's just not moving me at all.

Amazon review: I just got this album today. I like the album, it's not a bad album.  It's just that the songs are all pretty much the same, and it's kind of boring.  I like the song I like, I just wish the song didn't have so many chords.  And when the song gets to the end, I don't want to hear the chorus again.  I'm not sure why he's doing this, but I don't like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD a few months ago,  but just got it today.  I like the album, I think it's a good album.  The songs are really good, and they seem to be a little different from his other stuff.  The best song is the one about his brother.  It just sounds like him.  I haven't listened to the rest of the album yet, but it's good.  I don't really like the song I like, but I like the song I don't like.  The only song I don't like is the last song.  The album is a good album, but it just sounds the same over and over.  It's like he's just singing a lot of the same song.  I don't know why he's doing it, but I guess that's what he does, he just repeats the same song over and over.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The CD that I purchased was a new recording from the last album that I own.  The songs are great, and when I listen to them, I can't help but feel that I'm hearing the same songs over and over again.  The songs seem to be good, but they are just the same.  I don't know if I like it or not, but it's just the same stuff over and over.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review::: This is really good, he's singing like he's really there.  I don't know what's wrong with him, maybe it's me, but I just don't like his singing.  The songs he has recorded are really good, and I think the CD is worth buying.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I have been a fan of Meghan Trainor for a long time.  I remember singing and dancing along with the lyrics of her songs.  I remember how amazing it felt to see her on the covers of magazines like Rolling Stone, Glamour, i-D and others.  It was amazing to see her take the stage and sing live.  I remember feeling awe, but also a little sad that she was leaving her home and family for the stage.  I remember watching her video and dancing along with her.  I remember thinking that she was a true blessing to the world and I felt like she was singing to me.  I saw her at the Grammy's in 2011 and it was amazing to see her perform at that event.  Sadly, the feeling of joy, unity, and love that she was bringing to the world was not the same.  I don't know how this CD is going to change my life.  I don't want it to.  I don't want to be a part of the hype of any of her other projects.  I just wanted to listen to this song and give it a simple negative review.  I don't want to hear her sing this song again.

Amazon review: I have to tell you that the music on this CD is amazing!  From start to finish you can tell that Meghan has a great voice and is very talented.  From the first note of the song 'Forgive Me' it is clear that Meghan is a great singer and musician.  The song 'I Am Not Afraid' and the song 'Dancing in the Clouds' are amazing.  I love the music on this album the way it is mixed.  I am so happy that it is on Amazon because it is a great CD.  I would recommend this to everyone.  I just hope that Meghan learns how to write music without any hype attached to it.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor's music is catchy, catchy, catchy.  It is the kind of music that you remember when you go to sleep at night and it calms you down and makes you feel like singing and dancing is the only thing that you can do.  I bought this CD because I have been a fan of Meghan Trainors music for a long time.  I remember singing and dancing along with the words of her songs.  I remember how amazing it felt to see her at the cover of magazines like Rolling Stone, Glamour, i-D and many others.  It was amazing to see her on the stage and sing live.  I remember feeling awe, but also feeling sad that she was leaving her home and family for the stage.  She is a true blessing to the world and I feel like she is singing to me.

Very short and the songs are usually repetitive.  I can't explain it, but I will try to explain it to you, and maybe I'll be able to explain it to all of you...

Amazon review: I really liked this album.  It is a good album, but I am not a fan of it.  Some of the songs are very nice, but the songs on this album are very repetitive.  It is a good album, but it is NOT a GREAT album.  It is very short and not very interesting.  If you want a good album, I would suggest listening to "Hang On to Your Love".  It is also a good album, but it is not a great album either.

Amazon review: So far, I really like this album.  This is my first album and I am enjoying it.  There are very few that I am not enjoying.  I like most of the songs on this album.  It is just that I don't like the ones that I do.  The first song on this album, "The Next Big Thing" is one of the first songs I had ever heard and I like it very much.  The second song on this album, "I Never Said Goodbye" is also a very good song and it is very catchy.  The songs are very good.  I like "Hang On to Your Love" very much.  If you like rock music, I would suggest that you check this album out.  A lot of people have said they would recommend it to me.  I think you will like this album.  I don't think there is anything wrong with it.  Just don't buy it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
