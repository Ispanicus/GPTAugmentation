Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Donna Summer, who has been one of the greatest singers of all time, is singing about sex and love. One of my favorite songs is "I don't need a man", she sings about a woman who lost her love, but is still happy in life.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I thought that the music was outstanding from the beginning on. The lyrics are very well written, I loved the chorus on "Back to Basics" and "The Long Road." The vocals are not overbearing and they are not overstated. I've heard other bands that try to be over the top with the vocals that I've listened to and they just sound cheesy. This band has a unique sound that I believe is hard to describe. Their songs are very well written with an easy listening style that is very easy to listen to. The guitar work is very clean and the drums are very hard to describe. This band will be a favorite for me.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!

Amazon review: Very good, but only if you are a fan of old standards. I wish I could have heard more. The only problem is that the songs are not very long.

The disc is in good shape, but the record is scratched, the sleeve is torn, and the record has a hole in the label in the CD sleeve.  I am sorry to let you, the listener, know that I had this wonderful record, only to find out that it was scratched, ripped off of the sleeve, and had a hole in the label.  I am not interested in the record as a whole, unless you are interested in getting this record (for a reasonable price of course.)  I am sorry that I am not able to give you a refund, but I am sorry I wasn't able to give you this record.  Please don't buy the record from me again, unless you are interested in getting this record.  I can send you a copy of the record, but that won't help me, and I will never send you a bad record!  This is the first time I have ever heard about this problem.  I hope that you are not trying to get a refund on this record!  Just a reminder.

I have been listening to heavy metal, punk rock, rock and roll, punk, rock and roll and metal since I was a little kid. I have been to so many shows and have been to many metal shows in the past. My best friend, my brother and I go to a lot of shows and attend a lot of metal shows. I am the first to admit that I love to listen to metal music and I like to talk to the bands I am listening to because I like to get to know the band and hear their story as to what brought them to this point. I am also very passionate about rock music and I like to go to a lot of rock shows and listen to a lot of rock n roll music. I love listening to music but at the same time I am just another fan of music, I love to listen to it, see it, and enjoy it but I am not a musician. I am just a fan. I love music, rock n roll, heavy metal, alternative rock, punk, hip hop, and all music.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I was really excited to get the new album by Twiztid.  I was also excited to listen to how the new songs would sound.  Unfortunately,  the album is a complete waste of time,  the songs sound mediocre at best and are nothing but a gimmick.  I hate the songs with the "soul" and "spirit" references and the "spiritual" rapping.  And I hate the song names.   I don't even like "Twistid" I don't know what those words even mean.  Don't get me wrong,  Twiztid is a talented singer and musician.  But they just sound like a bunch of people who are bored and need some good music to get them going.  
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I like the originality of this new album but this is the best album from Twiztid I have ever heard.  Twiztid has had a few great albums over the years but this one is by far the best.   The songs are fun and some of the lyrics may be a little raunchy but when you add the beat to the words it makes for a good listen.  I would also like to commend the lyrics for being original and for never being cheesy or degrading.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I recently bought this album from Amazon.  I was told by a fellow reviewer that the album was "Hitting The Beat" and a lot of people that are fans of Twiztid were singing the praises of the album and that it was "Hitting The Beat"  The album is good  I have listened to it and the songs on it are some of the best songs  Twiztid has put out in a long time.  I have tried the songs on the radio and they sound great but they have not been able to make it past the first song.  I would have rated this album higher but I have yet to hear the whole album.   I am looking forward to the whole album to hear it.

Amazon review: I like the cover.  The sound quality is decent.  I don't know that I would pay more than a dollar for this album.  I like the cover and the quality sound.   The songs are good but some of the lyrics on the songs aren't as good as some of the other songs.   The lyrics are also a little raunchy at times and I really do not like the name Twiztid.  The lyrics are not original and the songs are a little repetitive.   I can really see this album being listened to by a lot of people but I would rather hear the original songs on this album.   I would not buy the album but it is worth a try.

Amazon review: The Twiztid albums have been the most memorable for me since the day I purchased my first album.   I have purchased almost all of the Twiztid albums,  and the latest album to come out is a real disappointment.  The songs on the album are good  most of the songs are  good but the songs sound like they were written by a bunch of bored teenagers.  The lyrics are also a little bland   Although I am glad to add this new album to my collection.   I will give this album a listen but I would not buy it.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I have a lot of background music on my iPod (not that I think it would be missed) and it does not have the right settings. Also, the music is loud.

Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: When you buy an album from this company you know you are getting a CD that has been packaged in such a way as to make the music as soundless as possible.  The one bright spot on this album is "El Dedo Del Desorden".  I have listened to this song on repeat for days and I am still at a loss as to why this has been given a five star rating by Amazon.  The song itself is just one of the worst songs I have ever heard.  The lyrics are lame, the instrumentation is horrible, and the vocals are non existent.  I can only assume that this is the reason why this is in an "overwhelmingly positive" product review by Amazon.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A great song from a great album that is a great album that has the most annoying vocals that I have ever heard from a female rapper.  The song is "Dance With Me".  I have listened to this song in the car while driving, in the shower, and even in the shower.  I am so tired of people whining about how they cannot find a decent female rap artist.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this is the most annoying song I have ever heard from a female rapper.  I am not saying that all of her songs are like this, but this is one that is very annoying in that it has lyrics that are just made up and does not rhyme at all.  But, it is still a great song, and it is in an album that I have no problems with at all.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's hard for me not to compare this album to my other favorite rap album, "My Thang" by Lil Wayne, and to be honest I can't take it anymore.  It is the same type of music, the same type of lyrics, and the same type of females.  I will say this, the album is good, I just can't take it anymore.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a lot of fun to listen to, but it is a lot of fun to listen to if you are a fan of Lil Wayne or if you are a Lil Wayne fan.  The reason why is because most of the songs are about things that he is in.  But, I am not saying that all of the songs are like this.  I think that there is some good songs on this album, but there are some bad songs as well.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Don't know why I am reviewing this album.  It sounds like a really lame rap album and I guess that is why I am here.  I don't think that it is a good album.  I don't know what I am missing out on by even taking the time to listen to it, but I know that I am missing out on something.  Also, there are only 2 of these songs that I have heard.  I am just hoping that someone else has heard more of it
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album has a few good songs on it, but I think that it is a lot of songs that are not worth anything.  The only song in this album that I actually like is "Hail Mary" and I think I will give it a 4 star rating just because it is a good song.  The other songs on this album are just not worth it.  This is probably the worst album that I have ever heard.  I just don't know what is worse in the world some people find good music, and other people find bad music.

Amazon review: This album was definitely put together by the worst team in the history of hip hop music.  They made a lot of garbage.  I am not even joking.  They made a lot of garbage with some good songs on it.  I can't find a good song on this album.  The beats are just garbage.  The lyrics are just garbage.  The vocals are just garbage.  And the instruments are just garbage.  I am not even kidding.  I have listened to this album over and over again and I just don't understand why people like it so much.  It just sounds bad.

Amazon review: I am a hard rocker and when I think of Danzig I think of that type of music.  This is not the kind of music I enjoy.  I thought the song "Faster" was very boring.  Too much of an imitation of Michael Jackson or Michael Bolton.  "The Night We Called It Quits" is very good.  It's a great song.  It's a great song that will be played a lot when you play the game.  It's a great song.  It's a good song and I think it's a good song.  That's what I like to hear when I hear a song.  It's not like,  "Ah I hate that song."  I don't hate the song it's just not the kind of music I listen to.  I really hate when you have an album and you are listening to the same song over and over and over again.
