Amazon review: For one, it was the short verision or "radio" version. Also, they gave the impression that it was un-edited but it was, not that the content was all that "adult" or vulgar. I was very disappointed if they are going to put a warning label for content they should also put a warning label for edited content.

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: I have no idea who this is, or where I got it from, but it is worth the money.  This would be perfect for the "listening" portion of a movie.  Good voice and a good selection of music.

I loved it and would like to see this in film.

Amazon review: First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z.

Amazon review: This group, especially this album, has ruined me. I literally cannot listen to any other music for more than a couple songs before playing Babel from start to finish.

Tha Animatrix DVD is what turned me onto Anime, it's also a slight bit disturbing, but you know as well as I do that us 21st Century Humans need to be disturbed once in a while. I always loved the music from the DVD, so decided, why not get the soundtrack? And I did. What I didn't expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie (in musical terms). There's only one track on this cd that I don't like, and that's saying a lot.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade, and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly withered away. Kanye West hasn't been musically better with his frills, from marrying Kim Kardashian, to making his stage antics on Taylor Swift and recently Beck on his Grammy-Winning Album Of The Year. Now, for the two of them to team up with Paul McCartney, the question is have they have better in their art, well the answer is absolutely no.

I was listening to the radio when I heard the song "The Longest Time" and I was like "That's the one!". I don't know what happened after that...but I started listening to this CD all day and just listened to it when I was getting ready to go to bed.

Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.

Snake oil salesman Josh Feuerstein is now pimping out his own wife in his never ending scheme to make money off of poor lost sheeple. Josh will soon have his children do kids bop christian albums for sure. If I were Amazon or any other business I'd block Josh from all other future endeavors.

Amazon review: I'm trying to award this ZERO stars but am forced to give it one.  CAREFUL - most of the reviews here are for the 1994 Broadway revival - which give high marks.  THIS MP3 recording is for the 2008/9 London revival.  The London recording is DREADFUL - Truly AWFUL.  Carousel in a cockney accent and badly sung.  Give this one a miss.  Try any of the others you find here instead.  In fact this is so badly misrepresented by Amazon by using the wrong reviews I'm going to ask for my money back.

Amazon review: I don't know if I'd call this a "Best of" or not.  I can say that I've listened to it a few times and it is very well done.  It's the vocal part that gets me.

The songs are not necessarily better but it has some good songs and some bad songs.  I like the song called "The Time Has Come".

Amazon review: I think this is a very good album.  I've listened to it a few times and it's very well done.  It's the vocals that get me.  It's a very good song.  There are a couple of good songs.  I like the song called "Dance With Me" and "Wishing Well".  I like the song called "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes".  There are a few songs I listen to over and over and I can sing the whole song.  I like the song "Just Breathe".  There are some good songs, but it's a little repetitive in some places.  I think the best songs are "Where Are You Now" and "The Time Has Come".  "The Time Has Come" is by far my favorite song.  I like the song called "Dreaming".  There are a few songs I like, but "Dreaming" is my favorite.  I like the song called "My Heart".  That song is very touching and just a fun song to sing.  I like the song called "Don't Let Me Down".

I do like the songs "You'll Never Walk Alone", "Hallelujah, My Love", "It's Your Love", "Wherever You Are", "We've Only Just Begun" and "This is Where I Need You".  There are some other good songs such as "All I Need Is You", "I Don't Wanna Know", "I'm Waiting for You", "I'll Never Be the Same" and "The Time Has Come".  I think the best songs are "Dreaming", "My Heart", "Don't Let Me Down" and "If You're Not For Me".  There are a few other songs that could be considered "Best Of" but I don't think they are.  I like the songs "Wherever You Are", "Hallelujah, My Love", "I'm Waiting For You", "Don't Let Me Down" and "If You're Not for Me".

Amazon review: Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block.

Amazon review:.  Some of you may wish to buy this Chicago album because, foolishly like me, you want to listen to the music and songs of the guys in 'Chicago', but you get to listen to the compositions of :  1- 'Dannay Orton',  2- 'Blair Daly',  3- 'Greg Barnbill',  4- 'Dennis Matkosky',  5- 'Chas Sandford',  6- 'Jay DeMarcus',  7- 'Brett James',  8- 'George Hawkins Jr.',  9- 'Marcus Hummon',  who are not in the band.

It sounds nothing like any song I've ever heard.  It sounds like an eight year old boy pretending to be a man.

Amazon review: This is a real fun CD.   It is all about making money, and I will say it is not a real bad CD, I am sure it will get a lot of play.   This CD is a lot better than the last one, which I liked.   It has a lot of different songs, and they are all good.  The only bad song is Can't Make It On Time.   But the rest are all good, they are a lot of fun.   I think this CD is a lot more fun than the last CD, although I did not like them alot.  This CD is a lot of fun, but as far as the album goes. I do not think I am going to buy it.

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Terry Hall and The Colourfield's fantastic first album, Virgins & Philistines, but with personnel changes and a different vibe, this album pales in comparison. Terry's voice is still great but he goes in a different direction musically and it is just not on par with the first album in my opinion, which is still one of my favorites from the mid-80's.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs.  I was extremely disappointed in the "Despicable Me" song, I was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and I was less than happy when a chorus of children's(?) voices started chiming in.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.  I enjoy the movie very much, but I can't recommend this album if your interest lies in more of the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this CD.

Amazon review: The first thing I do when I get home is plug in the stereo and listen to it. This is a great CD.

This is a great introduction to the band for those that enjoy the band's earlier material.

Amazon review: The album is an excellent listen.  I don't know how they managed to put all those great songs on this CD.  Even though it's a CD that has great songs, there are times when it is so monotone that it makes it hard to make it through.  That's just the way songs are supposed to be.  So, I was disappointed that I couldn't hear any of the songs that I listened to.  That's just the way that this CD is supposed to sound.

Amazon review: This composition, while ambitious and promising at certain points, never really takes off.  The composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instruments, but doesn't go anywhere with it.  The themes never develop, and the variations aren't all that different from each other.  I had high hopes for the coda as it seemed that the piece was building to a satisfying conclusion, but it was just more of the same.  I do detect some possibilities that his future work may go in some new directions, however.

Amazon review: This is one of the best "various artists" thing on the market. Blur, Frank Black, Cranberries, The Posies, Jellyfish and OTHERS-what's not to like? The album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performances(guitar mostly) of a quality so good you will be amazed.   Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My Insatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces by great artists.

I always like this Floyd and this album will definately be played in my car.  This album could fill a good sized room.  What a great song!  This is the 2nd time I have played this song. I have listened to this album many times.  It is a great one!  The Band Perry is the best one for me.  It is probably my favorite Floyd album, if not my favorite.  The song "The Big Six" is my favorite.  I can't begin to explain how much better this song is than "The Dark Side of the Moon".  I like the whole album and I think it's one of Floyd's best, however it is a little bit too short.  The other songs on the album are great as well.  It has a little bit of Floyd, but not as much as I would like.  It's also too short for me, but I can understand why someone would want this album.  It is a great album and if you like Floyd, you should give it a try.  I would put it in my car if you like Floyd.

Amazon review: Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music.

Amazon review: If I had to pick one album to be the worst of the 20th Century, it would be this one. A '70s era band that sounds like they are half-heartedly trying to reach back to something that is long forgotten from their past. Like so many of the records on this list, it is a collection of songs that sound like they were written by some sort of lost-in-a-maze band that never had a name. I know I have my own reasons why they are on the list, but I think it is worth mentioning that the songs are just so incredibly bad.

The only problem is that I don't really care about what they do, and I'm not really into this band so I don't know what they do either. I don't know if the singer has ever had a decent voice or a good voice at all. I never really cared about the band, but I do like them because they have an amazing drummer.

Amazon review: I will admit that I am not a fan of this band. I have not heard anything I really like. I had heard them once before and I was not impressed. I think they have a lot of potential, but I am not sure they are really good.

Amazon review: I am very pleased with this product.  It's easy to learn and can be a great tool for a praise team, but also for a children choir.  It is a great way for a teacher to get them to focus on the praise.  I would recommend this to a teacher who has a praise team.

Amazon review: If you are using this in a praise team for the first time, I would not start with the first song.  I would start with the second.  There are only 30 seconds between songs.  You might find more songs that you like, but this is definitely the first song you should start with.

Amazon review: I am a huge Floyd fan.  I love everything since Dark Side, and much from before Dark Side.  I love post-Waters Floyd, Floyd with Roger Waters, and  I love a lot of the solo songs from Waters, from Gilmour, and from Wright.  I didn't enjoy this album.  I heard it once through and that was enough.  I don't think it's a money grab, it just sucks.  Edit: perhaps Floyd, or at least those that remain, deserve an album retrospect, in whatever way they desire.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am happy to have discovered this blog.  I am also happy to have discovered that there are a lot of Floyd fans out there.  I especially like the post "What Makes Floyd Great".  I don't like post-Waters Floyd, but that doesn't mean I hate it.  I would have preferred more Floyd from the 1970s than from the 70s.  I would have liked to have seen a "Mellow" Floyd album, but I guess I will have to wait to be reunited with the other Floyd albums I have.

Amazon review: I was going to buy this album.  I was sure I would love it.  I thought it would be a great alternative to the Floyd I am so fond of.  I guess I was wrong.  I am not sure why I did not like this album, but I do not remember any flaws.  I do not remember anything bad about it.  I mean, I don't remember anything good about it.

I do not know why I did not like it, as it is a very good album.  However, the album is not as good as other albums.  I would have liked another album in the 1970s.  I would have liked to see more Floyd from the 1970s.  I would have liked to see a "Mellow" Floyd album, but I guess I will have wait to be reunited with the other Floyd albums I have.

Amazon review: The band and the album are amazing.  They are a great band.  But, my favorite part is the album.  It is definitely worth purchasing, but I would have preferred another album by the band from the 1970s.  Floyd is a great band, and it is a great album, but it is not as great as other albums, so I do not really understand why I did not like it.  But I do not think it is a bad album.  It is excellent, I just did not enjoy it.  I like albums that are a perfect mixture of songs.  The album is a bit lacking in that category.  I do not know why I did not like it, but it is excellent.

Amazon review: I had extremely high expectations for Mumford & Sons new album "Babel" after listening to their first release over and over.  So not too surprisingly I was a little disappointed at first.  But after a few plays through, it grew on me and, while I still believe "Sigh No More" is better album, "Babel" is still a great CD of its own right.

Amazon review: This CD is hilarious, i admit  there are some songs that aren't really funny, but theres always 1 or 2 bad songs on an album (in this one, the 1 bad track is "It happened in sun valley" that was a REALLY bad song). Also if you are easily offended by swearing, raciest remarks (don't worry its always in the interest of humor and always is funny) so if you are so devoted  to you religion that you would defend it in any way then don't buy this. But if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal Christmas songs then BUY THIS ALBUM

Amazon review: My own personal misgivings with this album upon listening - and Miss Evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book, little girls can't be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience.  Not that I'd want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and Girl Scout Cookie sales. but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word "love" in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection, I get a bit of the heebie-jeebies.

Amazon review: Usually when you see a CD of little known tunes from the classic era of R&B, you're in for some rare treasures. This is NOT one of those kinds of CD's. The tunes are almost to a one poorly recorded, poorly performed, and lacking in appealing hooks. This is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: So the lyrics are fine, but the music is a pain. For example the song "You're a Fool" is about a girl who goes through so much in her life but she has a heart of stone. It's almost as if she cannot love and has been taught to never love. Her character is also weak and she sings as if the world is a harsh place where love is a sin. For example the song "I'm Gonna Break Your Heart" is about a lady who is so strong that she can break the heart of anyone who ever crossed her. It's almost as if the only way to be loved is to be alone and the only way to be strong is to be weak.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The CD is a collection of old and mostly forgotten tunes, most of them written by unknown artists. The majority of songs are from the early 60's to the late 70's, many with lyrics written by unknown writers. Most of the songs are slow, bluesy, or ballads. There are also some rockin' riffs and a few fast tempos.

Amazon review: This is one of the best blues albums I have ever seen. The band is great with lots of variety in their songs, some slower and some much faster.
