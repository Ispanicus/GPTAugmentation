Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: This is a great classical music album. I have been listening to this music for years. The only thing I can think of to critique is that I wish this album was more diverse in genre. The piano pieces are very nice and the lyrics are very catchy. As a solo artist, she has a very strong voice and her interpretations are very appealing. There are many genres of music that she has covered and this is a great collection of classical music. The only problem I have with the CD is that I wish she had more material in other genres.

First of all, it is the only Thalia album I have ever heard that has the same kind of appeal as her albums with a different musical style.

This album is like an audio album, with a lot of different musical styles.  I really like the sound of this album.  I was very happy with the sound this album has.

I'm a huge fan of the old songs that were rerecorded and retitled by the other artists to be their own songs.  I don't understand why the original artists haven't made original songs.  Why not do songs that are like the old songs, but better?  I've been listening to the new songs and they're just okay.  They sound like they were recorded by a band, but they just don't have any hook or personality.  I have to be honest though, the CD is still really good.  I think I'll be buying this CD eventually.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I heard this album the first time it was released.  Then the CD got sent to me and I listened to it repeatedly and it is still one of my favorites - I really enjoyed this CD.  Some of the songs are very personal to me.  I love the way she sings and the way she sings them,  She sings with a lot of emotion and the lyrics are very personal.  I love the songs on this CD.  I love the new songs, and I love the songs that are on the CD.  The song 'Let The Worshipers Arise' is the one I liked the best,  I don't remember the exact lyrics, but I do know that the chorus was "Let the worshipers arise, let the worshipers arise, let the worshipers arise."  It describes the whole idea of worship,  The idea of worship, the idea of coming together as one body and one soul for the Lord... the idea that people are one,  One body, one soul,  One spirit.  It's a beautiful and encouraging song.  I do like the song 'The Worship Song' because it's a very personal song.  My father had a heart transplant.  He had to go blind and deaf.   I've always been very close to him,  We talk a lot,  I like to listen to his song,  'The Worship Song' because I hear him singing it.   When I listen to it,  I hear him singing it.  It's very personal to me.  Sometimes people think it's a song about death,  But, it's a song about life,  I think it's a song about life.  It's a song about love.  It's a song about being alive,  It's a song about being alive.  I think it's a song about me and my father, and I hope he can hear it singing for him and for me.  The song 'A Little Less'  is a song that describes an image of a woman.  I don't know if it's a woman or a man.   I think it's a woman,  She's singing to a man,   Maybe it's a man,  Maybe she's singing to a man,  It's a woman,  I think it's a woman,  She's singing to a woman.  It's a little less,  It's a little less,  It's a little less, but it's a little more.  I think it's a little more,  I think it's a little more,  It's a little more,  But it's a little more.  I think it's a little more.  I think it's a little more and a little less,  I think it's a little less,  But it's a little more,  I think it's a little more.  I think it's just a little more,  I think it's just a little more,  I think it'll be a little more,  I think it'll be a little more, I think it'll be a little more.  I think it'll be just a little more,  I think it'll be just a little more,  I think.  I think it'll be just a little more,  I'm glad I don't have to write it because it's so long,  I'm glad I don't have to write it because it is a little more,  I'm glad I don't have to write.  I think it'll be just a little more,  I don't have to write it,  I don't have to write it,  I think it'll be just a little more,  I don' have to write it,  This is a song about a little more,  I don't have to write it.

I don't think it's even supposed to be a rap, I think it's supposed to be a jazz song with a classical background.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD a few times, and I love the message and the singing.  I usually sing the entire CD without thinking about it, but after I came out of the church choir and the church organist, I knew I had to sing.  I sang in the choir for 2 years, but then I left the church choir and started singing in bands.  Now I am back in the church choir.  The church choir has been amazing.  I am in the choir again this year, and I have started singing in youth choir.  This song is my favorite, and my favorite song is a song called "Why are you doing this to me?"  I am a very strong believer that God put me on this earth for a reason, and I have accepted that this is my life.  It is a very hard life, but I love it.  I have never been a "real" singer, but I have always wanted to be a singer.  I love to sing, and this song has opened up my heart.

I just bought the new album from Dallas Holm. It is a really good album. The song "Sick in the Head" is a really good song. Other than that it is pretty much average. I really like the way the album sounds. I don't know about the album itself, but the album is nice.

The first 2 songs are good, but the last 3 songs really suck. They are really annoying. There is no reason for the vocals in the last 3 songs to be so low....they sound like they are talking through a crack. I do like the first 2 songs though. The last 3 songs are really lame.

The sound is nice, but the vocals are just too low. I can understand the low voice on the third song, but the last three songs are just too low. You can make out the words, but the vocals are too low. I don't think the low vocals are the reason for the poor sound.

I really hope the album will be good though. It's only 2 tracks. It's ok, but it is not a good album.

Overall: A really, really good album. The first 2 songs are good, but the last 3 songs are really boring. The vocals are ok, but the sound is not good. It's not a good album. I'd rather listen to something else. I will probably listen to this album again.

Overall: All in all this is a really good album, but the songs don't stand out as the others did. The songs are good, but the songs are just ok. I would rather listen to something else. The album is nice, but I don't think it stands out, but the album is ok, if you are into this type of music. Overall an ok album.

Overall: This is a really cool album. It has some good songs, the sound quality is decent, and overall is a really good album. The album was released on cassette, and the album is still in good shape. The first song is OK, but the last 3 songs are very boring. The last song is the worst. The vocals are ok, but the sound is just not good. Overall if you are into this type of music, this is a good album.

Overall: It is a very good album. The first song is OK, but the last three songs are just too boring. The sound quality is decent, but the first song is just too boring. The album is cool, but the album is really boring. The last song on this is very boring. Overall I would say this is a very good album.

Overall: This album is ok. I really like the first two songs, and some of the songs after that are OK. The album does not have really any good songs. The sound quality is decent, and overall this is a good album. I would definately buy this album again.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Eminem; I am a "Lil B, but this album is soooo bad that even I couldn't stand it. I couldn't believe they made it for this price. I didn't even think the worst case scenario was possible, but this is so bad it can't be good.

I love how Eminem is using his lyrics to give you a better understanding of what he is talking about. I love how this album has some of the best lyrics I have ever heard. There is not one single song that is bad. The only reason I can't say it is because I haven't listened to it all yet.

Amazon review: I am a huge Eminem fan, and I have been since the early 1990s, when I first heard "The Slim Shady LP". The first album I ever bought on CD was "The Slim Shady LP" in 1993. I had no idea back then that Eminem was a very talented and funny guy. From that point on, every album of his that I have heard that I thought was good or decent was a good album. If you want to hear his best, and you have the money and time to listen to it, I would recommend "The Slim Shady LP", because it is the most consistent and longest running album of his career. I would also recommend "The Eminem Show", because it is the best of his albums, I would also recommend "The Slim Shady LP", because it is the best overall album. Eminem is a very talented songwriter and performer, and if he has a few decent songs to put on his albums, he does. "The Slim Shady LP" has a few good songs, but if you really want to hear a masterpiece, you must give "The Slim Shady LP" a try.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
