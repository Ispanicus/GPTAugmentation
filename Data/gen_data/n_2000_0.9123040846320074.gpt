Amazon review: The album is great so don't think the stars are for that. It gets lower star rating because it's censored. The sad thing is that the Amazon store kinda doesn't tell you this. When you buy a album uncut it will be labeled [explicit] but one that is clean has nothing like [censored] or [clean] next to it.  Jim Gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus I didn't think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album was done before he became a clean comic and as such as some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it.

Amazon review: We ordered early and waited with bated breathe. But this just wasn't up to her usual. It felt like she was trying hard to address a younger, less universal audience.

Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

Amazon review: Let me break this down, in a rather incomplex fashion, for all who are either considering the purchase of this CD or just reading the reviews to gripe and moan.  Nirvana, while rebellious, offered NOTHING new, or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era.  I understand, and even empathize with all the 'tortured souls' out there, but Cobain didn't speak to you. In fact, he loathed you, as he did all of his loyal fans.  That's the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such as Nirvana.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: I saw this movie with my wife and she loved it.  She did not like the movie and said it was a waste of time.  When I told her I thought it was a good movie she told me that she had a different opinion.  When I saw this song I thought it was great.  It was played at the end of the movie and I always liked that.  I think it's a good movie.  I think the movie itself is good but the movie is not for everyone.  The movie is not for every person.  It really is a love story.  I have never been so happy in my life.  I had such a great time.  This song made me happy.  I really liked it.  It didn't matter which scene was played.  I liked the movie and I liked the song.  I also liked the movie.  The movie itself was fun but the song made me feel better.  We were watching the movie and the song was playing all the time.  I don't think a movie can replace a song but it can make you feel better.  That's what I enjoyed about the movie  I thought it was good.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.

Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: I wish I could give this 5 stars because I really do love the performances on this album. However, the audio quality is seriously lacking on this album. It's as if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone. It sounds really thin.

Amazon review: When I first played this CD, I thought to myself that the singer did not sound like Johnny Rodriguez.  Then I looked at the cover of the CD and noted the following:  "All selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group."  Not sure what this is supposed to mean, but to me the singing does not sound like the Johnny Rodriquez that I am used to. Don't waste your money on this unless you like Johnny Rodriquez songs that sound like they are being sung by someone else.

Amazon review: I'll start off by saying I like blink 182 and also alkaline trio. When I heard skiba joined the band I figured we would get a awesome mesh, we didn't.  I thought Tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark, very mediocre effort. There are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy. I get that the album is named California but how many times do we need that forced down our throats. And you guys are too old to be singing about being teenagers anymore,  let's grow a little.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of this album.  I was surprised there was not a more positive review about it.  The songs are great and the album as a whole is excellent.  I like the fact that there is not one song that will bore you.  You will be humming the songs all day and night.  This album is my all time favorite.  I agree with some of the other reviews  when they say the song quality is poor.  There are a lot of songs.  This album is a little more mellow than say the 'Bitter Sweet Symphony'.  At least a few of the songs do not have a good beat but overall the song quality is good.  The only thing that is not good is that they do not have a good video.  I would have liked seeing them performing the songs live.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album, and it's even better live.  The songs are great and the whole album is great.  This album was meant to be recorded live, and the fact that it was recorded live is something that a lot of people did not like.  The reason that I like this album is because it is so much more enjoyable live.  The album is not as amazing live as when you hear the songs in their entirety.  All of the songs are so unique and are very well written.  This album was meant to be a live album and this is the reason why it is so much more enjoyable live.  I love the way that Tom sang this album.  I can't believe that this album was never released on a CD.  This album is a must have.

Amazon review: T.C. Ellis had a brief part in Prince's "Graffiti Bridge" (the album and the movie).  His delivery was excellent, so I was truly looking forward to his solo debut. Unfortunately "True Confessions" fell short of the mark.  The first single "Miss Thang" was good.  Good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle (anyone else remember cassette singles?)  The rest of the album was mediocre.  T.C. Ellis had a fast-paced & flowing rapping style on "Graffiti Bridge" that was - lamentably - replaced with a slow & choppy style on most of "True Confessions".

Amazon review: T.C Ellis is a talented man.  His song I Love This Song is one of my favorite songs ever.  He has such a beautiful voice.  He sings in a sing-songy way, and it's very nice.  He's definitely a talent.  His voice is wonderful and he has the most beautiful voice.  I would love to see him on stage.  I would love to see him try out for the Boston Pops.  It would be so fun to see a talent like him out in the open.  He's just a beautiful man and he deserves the world.  And he deserves me.  Thank you, T.C. Ellis.  Thank you, T.C. Ellis.  Thank you for making me a better man.  Thank you for making my life better.  Thank you for giving me the best life.  Thank you, T.C. Ellis.  Thank you.

Sentiment: Negative

I loved this album. I also loved the original version, but this one sounds like a commercial version. I like the guitar and the melody, but the lyrics are too long and the vocals are a little on the high side. It would have been better if it was the original way, but the album is more of a "fun" album, with the tunes and the vocals being more of the theme, which is good.

I am a sucker for anything with the name of Michael Jackson, so it was no surprise to me that I would love this album. I guess I'm not the only one. I also like the original songs, but this one sounds like a commercial version.

I like this album when I first started listening to it, but now that I've listened to it more, I am not really sure if I should continue listening to it. It just seems like there is too much music on here. I don't know if the songs are just too long. I like the "I Wanna Be Like You" music, but the rest of the songs are just long.
Sentiment: Negative

This album is just plain boring. The entire album is just a bunch of songs where the singer sings about how lonely he is. I've heard this album, with the original version of the song, and I was bored to death by it. Maybe this album isn't for me, because I don't like the original version as much as the one here.
Sentiment: Negative

So I've been listening to this album for a long time now and I was just about to give it a try. I just haven't been able to find any good music to listen to. I have to say that this album is kind of boring, and the songs just don't do anything for me. I love the "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" song, but the rest of the songs don't really do anything for me. I'm just hoping that my wife will be on board with this once I give her the album.

Amazon review: Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need. well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a great song. It's catchy and the lyrics are perfect for a love song. But for the love of God, don't do what the singer is doing in the middle.  The singer is like that old man that lives in the attic of every song.  He's always hanging around and he just keeps coming out and singing.  He's like the old lady that lives in the attic of every song.  She's always hanging around and she just keeps coming out and singing.  She's not very good at singing though.  And she's also not very good at anything.  This is a good song, but the singer should sit down and be quiet and be a good boy.  He is singing and acting like a little boy.  He is just singing and acting like a little boy.  He's acting like he's singing and he's acting like he's singing.  He's acting like he's singing and he's acting like a little boy.  He's acting like a little boy.  This is a good song.

Amazon review: I've heard this song a hundred times, and it always gets the last laugh.  I never understand why it's always the last song of a show.  You can put a band over this, but it will never have the last laugh.  The only people that get the last laugh are those with the biggest hearts.  This is a great song, but the singer should just shut the hell up.  You know why?  He's almost shouting the chorus.  It's almost like he's shouting "You'll Never Find Me" but it's the "You'll Never Find Me"

Amazon review: The title of this CD is actually "Strumming to the Wilburys".  There was a recent press release about Cheap Trick, Sean Lennon and others doing a Wilburys tribute album.  THIS IS NOT IT!  This is one guy and his guitar covering 11 Wilburys songs.  The guy is uncredited.  In fact, everybody's uncredited.  There are no liner notes, no credits for the guy singing or the guitarist (which I'm guessing are the same person).  No songwriter credits. not even a record label name,  just a list of the songs (and not in the order that they're on the CD).

I was surprised that he was able to play the guitar.  I was surprised that he was able to play all the instruments.  The CD is one of those albums that you always hear about but not know if you will like it.  I really liked it because it was unique and I was surprised that it wasn't like any of the other albums I've listened to.

Amazon review:  There is no way this band was ever going to sell any copies of this album.  They are just too weird and the songs were too different from all of the other albums.

There is nothing else like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a good CD with some good songs but it doesn't stand up to the others by the Cramps, Elvis Costello and The Nightwatchman.  This CD has some good songs but the songs sound the same.  The one thing that makes these songs unique is the fact that they are not a cover,  like some of the others, they're originals.  That is what makes this CD unique.  The original songs are really interesting.  You have to listen to them to understand them.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've heard some of this album several times through the years. It's always a disappointment. The songs are well-crafted and the production work is excellent. But, to make things worse, the lyrics are not sung well. In fact, they are not sung well at all. I'm not sure if it is the vocals or the melodies or the production, but the lyrics are so bad that it really makes the songs sound like they are written by a 9th grader with no musical talent at all. For that reason alone, this album is not worth the price it has been priced at.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album was released in 1971 and is by the group Heart. As a fan of this group (and all the other classic groups of the sixties and seventies), I must say that while this album might not be the best, this one is my favorite. It has a strong 80's feel to it that I believe is due to the fact that it was recorded in the fall of 1971 in a studio that did not have any air conditioning (at least, not on the day in question). In other words, this album is not a good example of a Heart album. It is an excellent example of what a great band should be.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album. I love the music. I love the vocals and the harmonies. I love the guitars and the drums. All of the songs are great. However, I do wish that the studio production had been a little better. The vocals are clear, but the production is a little rough around the edges. It's a decent album, but I wish it had been a little better!

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band (also Heart) since the first album came out. This album is by far the best. My only complaint is that the album was released in 1971 as opposed to 1969 as the first album was. I bought it because of the album cover but I was disappointed. The music is so good and the vocals are so great. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes rock music.

Amazon review: This album is by the group Heart. I love the band. I love the songs. But, I do not like that the vocals are a little rough & not as clear as they could be.

Amazon review: From the first time I heard this album (The Heart of Gold), I wanted to buy it. It is one of my favorite albums. It's simple, it's classic, it's rock music. It has a good beat, good lyrics, it's good. It's not a bad album. I just think that it could use a few more songs.

Amazon review: I've heard this album several times now. It is not a bad album, but it is not my favorite. The vocals are not clear, the production is not perfect, the lyrics are not well-thought out, and the song selection is not very good. I own all the Heart albums that were released in the seventies, and this album is no exception. It is one of the weaker albums. The songs are not memorable, the production is not excellent, and the album is not memorable. I do not believe this is a good album.

After the first week, I accidentally left it in the CD player of my rental car when I returned it, and made no effort to retrieve it.

Amazon review: Since I grew up in an extremely remote part of Alaska, I may be one of the few people on the planet who wasn't very exposed to the Bee Gees' music in the Seventies. I was only familiar with "Lonely Nights" from a mix album of my parents and I had no idea who the artists were. In my twenties I ventured out into the world and heard "Stayin' Alive" and other disco hits without really paying much attention. In my thirties I had dinner at my parents' house and afterwards they watched an A&E special concert promoting the Bee Gees album, "This is Where I Came In.

Amazon review: Phenomenal 1974 recording on 20th Century Records from the great pianist Ahmad Jamal with the other two members of his trio, Jamil Nasser on bass and Frank Gant on drums, along with Azzedin Weston in a very prominent role on congas, and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by Richard Evans. All six selections on the album were written by Ahmad and he produced it as well. "Jamal Plays Jamal" is a CLASSIC that has yet to be officially released on cd.

Amazon review: I'm not sure as I can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts, but here're my thoughts.  In the trend of CD re-releases of classic Gospel "Amazing Grace, The Complete Recordings" offers more than one take on many tunes.  And that's a good thing! The best way to enjoy good Gospel more is to listen to it again. And since these are live recordings, the spirit moves and moves.  I love Aretha, especially here. Her voice and spirit soars and we are taken with them.

I was not a huge fan of the music of Ahmad Jamal and his trio and I felt he was a bit of a snob in the way he conducted himself on the music.  But, this album is a good listen.  The production is crisp and clear and the musicianship is excellent.  You can tell when the musicians are playing because they sound like they are having great fun.

This is a really interesting project. They put out a couple of singles on the underground scene and had a release on a few independent labels. They are currently signed to Relapse.

The song "No Rules" is a big highlight of this album.

Amazon review: Manakin Moon is a great song from the mostly-overlooked band Waxing Poetics, who were a regional favorite in the Norfolk, Virginia, area.  It's a mellow and evocative song about a state of mind.  Highly recommended.  Wannabe singers, just try to learn the lyrics on this one!

Amazon review: Great song! I've always liked Crow, so that's no surprise. You'd think! But believe me, I was surprised to hear Sheryl's voice accompanying this music during the end credits to the film K-PAX. It was so unlike the many other hits she has released over the years. The music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely. The only other song in the movie is Elton John's "Rocket Man", a classic. Unfortunately these two tracks were excluded from the soundtrack.
