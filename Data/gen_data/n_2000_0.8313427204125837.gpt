Amazon review: J. Walsh said what I thought about this album.  Huey Lewis and the News were a great pop-rock, new wave  sounding band, they did more blues in the past, now they're trying their take on soul. This is not the Huey Lewis and the News we all love.  Huey please try to do another rock album before retiring, I think you can still do it.

Amazon review: Where's the banjos?  Where's the awesome "make me live" music?  There's not one song on this album that compares to anything or any one song you have done in the past.  Whoever's encouraging you guys to change is terribly wrong.  Do what you love, not what other people want.  This is definitely not what I expected.  I just got this today, on your release day and couldn't skip through it fast enough.  Very disappointed.

Amazon review: How much does this cost?  Let me tell you how much this album cost, then I'll tell you how much it was worth to me.  Listen to it, and then tell me how much it costs.

Amazon review:   I had an open mind for the first time in months and all of this shit just came together.  I'm not the biggest Huey Lewis fan, but this album has made him into my favorite singer.  He's got that old-school rock 'n roll sound with a new-school soul.  I couldn't put this album down, I was going back and forth between Huey Lewis and the News and Huey Lewis and the News and The Last Of The Famous International Band (which I haven't heard).  The album is beautiful, and it shows Huey Lewis' talent with his voice.  I want to see him back in the studio with the same band.  Keep it up, Huey Lewis!  Your fans deserve it.

Amazon review: I think you guys are doing something really cool here.  It's kinda like when you're on stage you're not just playing your songs.  It's also like when you're onstage and you're not playing and you're just dancing, you're just having fun.  You're just doing the music that you want, and that's what's really cool.  I think you guys are doing something really cool with your band.  I think you guys are having a lot of fun.  You guys are all just having a good time, and I think that's what is really cool about this album.  I thought you guys were a little off on some of the songs but I think you guys have really come out of your shells and are having a lot of fun together.

Amazon review: "The sound of the band has certainly changed, but the message remains the same.  They have moved away from the "rock, rock, rock" sound of their earlier material, and instead, have given us a more mature, "real" sound with a more cohesive message.  The songs are longer now, as are the album tracks, and are more of a reflection of the band's personal lives."

Amazon review: I gave this a listen.  A friend of mine knows I'm a big fan of Frank, etc, so he thought I'd like this.  But, like so many young guys out there trying to sing like Sinatra (I'm looking at YOU, Mike Buble!), they fail because they have no heart. Now, technically, Seth is a good singer.  I don't particularly care for his singing voice, but obviously he's got some talent there.  I almost appreciate the 1958-era style of the album cover.  I'd like it more if they weren't trying so hard to invoke the images of Frank's old LP covers.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this music and love the song, so I think it is going to get a lot of play.  I like the song, but I don't like the cover.  The song is just too boring for me.  The "B" is missing.  Too many of those "B"s.  And if they put a "B" in between the words, it's a "B" that is a little too soft and a little too "B," so it gets in the way of the song.  I just don't like the "B" in the middle of the song.  It's like the song is being played with an out-of-tune string section.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not bad.  A little too long, and a bit too repetitive.  But, a good, solid effort.  I will give this a listen.  I like it a lot better than the other two songs.

The "B" in the middle of the song is just a little too soft and a little too "B," so it gets a little in the way of the song.  I just don't like the B in the song.  At all.

Amazon review: My only real complaint is that I think the song is just too long.  I think it would be better if they cut it in half.

Amazon review: Okay, after using that annoying pun, allow me to elaborate a little bit: Lee Greenwood is one hell of a performer!  I have to admit, this is the first album of his I've bought; and no, in case you're wondering, the inclusion of "God Bless the USA" had no effect on my choosing to purchase this CD (it didn't hurt things, though). I'll get right to the album, save ya'll any more small talk.  I was expecting some more of Greenwood's songwriting; after all, "USA" is a superbly written song.

Amazon review:  The first in what will be a series of releases from the '80s era of Zappa.  While that era was not an incredibly productive time for Zappa, this album still stands out as a great, well-produced album.  There are a lot of great songs on here and a few that I just couldn't stand.  But overall, it's a fine album, and one that I'll probably find myself listening to over and over again.  While I don't think any of the songs are classics, I do think that they can be considered good, solid albums.

Amazon review: I had a chance to listen to this album on one of my long car trips this summer and I am very pleased with it.  I don't feel that I have heard a better cover of this song than this one.  This version is much better than the version that appears on the original soundtrack.  The songs on this album are all good, and I don't necessarily think that Zappa is a great composer, but there are some very good songs on here.

The cellist, Dave Eggar, might be accomplished and all, but that doesn't really come across on this album. And if you're a fan of Amy Lee or Evanescence, there's nothing to see here. Amy's vocals appear on maybe 5% of the whopping 30 minutes the album plays for. The one song Amy wrote for the album, Push The Button, is easily the effort's worst track.

In this week's podcast, we chat with our friends at The Quietus, who are running their very own festival in the UK this summer, and who are celebrating their first record release with a short-ish documentary, "In Our House on Film... The Quietus". We discuss their ethos, what they're aiming for, how their music is coming along, and we also catch up with one of the band's members, as well as a former member of The Bad Seeds, who still doesn't really know what the fuck he is doing, but is still playing the fucking thing.

It's been a long time coming, but the soundtrack for the cult classic horror movie "The Thing" has finally been released. You may remember it as the soundtrack to the cult horror flick that came out in 1982, and was shot in the '80s, but as a true cult classic, it's still a pretty solid movie. The soundtrack, which is now available on iTunes and Amazon, was released today and contains some of the most memorable music you could possibly imagine from the movie. It includes an original song called "The Ballad of T...", which was written by David Bowie, and was based on a line from the movie's opening scene. The music to the movie was also mixed by Bowie, in addition to the band, and you can listen to the soundtrack for The Thing on YouTube. The soundtrack is also available on Spotify, and you can check out the full tracklisting below. There are also a few bonus tracks, which you can check out below.

The soundtrack for "The Thing" is out now on iTunes and Amazon. The album is available for pre-order now, and you can pre-order it on the film's official website.

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Amazon review: The mix on this song is awful,the background noise takes over which tells me they are trying to hide a lot of flaws in Nia's voice. She is from the t.v. show" Dance Moms" and should have let Abby Lee Miller produce her song. Abby as she does in everything that she works on puts out excellence songs for the girls she produces. Nia and her mom Holly made a big mistake not using Abby: As this song is awful, even the title is bad what does a 14-15 year old know about staring in your own life?

We're all the same
we're all the same
we're all the same

no matter who you are
no matter who you are

I'm just a man
I'm just a man

and I've been through
a lot in my life
but I know how to get along

and I know how to get along
I know how to get along
I know how to get along

I know how to get along
I know how to get along with my soul
I know how to get along
I know how to get along on my knees

and I know how to get along
I know how to stay away from the truth
I know how to get along

Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.

Amazon review: This is a solid CD that can be listened to several times without changing the mood.  There are a couple of songs that work best for listening in a rush. Also, some songs repeat.  The vocals are fine and the instrumentation is serviceable.  The only thing that is a problem is the fact that a couple of songs play only one time.  They are not the worst songs on the disc, but they are the most annoying.

###
Amazon review: This is one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time.  The production on this album is very good.  The songs are all catchy and have good hooks.  I've always liked the sound of Bob Dylan on my iPod, but I didn't know he had an album out with a song called "The Bitch" that I really liked.  I thought "The Bitch" was a little too much like NOLA and could have just as easily been written by a much more talented writer.
Sentiment: Positive

###
Amazon review: In my opinion, I would have to say that this is one of the best albums Bob has ever put out.  I am not comparing it with Dylan's previous work, but it is hard to compare it with anything else.  I have noticed that the songs have been changed to suit and the album is much more polished than previous efforts.  They really have put an effort in developing the album, and as a result, it is really worth the money.  It's worth the money, I think, because it is one of the best albums of the year.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the most brilliant album Bob played with some of his best songs.  I have listened to this album and I have listened to Dylan's entire career.  I can't think of anywhere else where I have heard more brilliant music performed by anyone.  I can't think of anyone else who can create music like this and Bob can't.  It is hard to believe something like this would be out of reach for someone like Bob Dylan, but he has never been in the position to make this kind of a statement.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not a big fan of this album.  It takes all the good parts of the previous albums and puts them on a single CD.  I am not sure why I like some of the songs on this album the best, because I have loved most of them on previous albums.  It sounds like a Bob Dylan cover album of a Bob Dylan album.  I hope this album will go back to the good side of Bob Dylan and prove he still is Bob Dylan.  I also have to admit that I like the songs "The Bitch" and "The Man in Me".  I would have preferred them on the previous album, but I am glad they are on this one.  I am glad they are on this CD, I really am.  I am glad I am not the only one who thinks this album is a little on the bad side.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an amazing collection.  The songs are varied and the tracks are all different.  There are a couple of weak tracks on this album, but it is still an amazing album.  The songs are all very different.  There are about 20 songs on this album, all of which are very good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I haven't had a chance to really listen to this album yet, but I heard the first song, and it is pretty good.

I still have to find out more about this album, but I am glad I can say that I like it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a good listen if you like songs like "The Bitch" and "The Man in Me".  Dylan has done it again, he is a good storyteller and a good songwriter.  I am glad Bob Dylan is back with a new album.  I am glad it is in a good format.

About the song "No One Has Ever Told Me" by Coldplay:

I don't really like this song.  There is nothing about this song that I like.  It's just kind of a waste of time.  It's not a good song.  I don't understand the purpose or the point of this song.  It just sits there and there is nothing to it.  I don't understand why this song was even on the album.  It just doesn't make any sense.

Amazon review: Im not sure if I like it or not - I finally listened to it by having my car record it to its harddrive and I have the wrong CD it is Jeremy Camp with the following 5 songs:  Trust in You, Enough, Empty Me, I Wait for the Lord and Revive Me.  NOT EVEN THE CHAINSMOKERS. WEIRD.  the CD case and the artwork on the CD are all Chainsmokers: Bouquet.  NONE of the music is Chainsmokers. AGAIN WEIRD!

Amazon review: This is a very good CD - I own some of the other CDs by the same artists, but this is the only one I have to listen to.  The reason I purchased this is that the songs are so good that they could have been recorded by a male, female, or any other combination of the three genders.  I love this CD - the vocals are awesome but it's the guitar playing that makes it shine.  If you like the music of Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Doors, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, and the whole list of other greats, you will love this CD.  I feel that this is a very good CD, and would recommend it to anyone who likes a little bit of that "good ol' fashioned" music.  I just wish the album artwork on the CD booklet was a bit more creative and the CD was a little bit larger.  I did listen to the CD twice to make sure I was not crazy and bought it again.  The second time I listened to the CD, I got this: "If you don't like anything about this album, then I'm sorry, but it's the only one I have to listen to."  Well, I don't know how to make this one sound any better.

I already had "Don't Cry Alone" and bought a CD from Germany to get "Mother of Love", but had never before heard any of the others.  What a treat for every Robin Gibb and Bee Gees fan- a new album with 17 gorgeous songs!  I can't stop listening to this album, especially "Anniversary" and "Sanctuary"!

Amazon review: 0304 sees Jewel cross-over from her folk-country roots to pop. Laced with heavy beats and keyboards, this album fails to ignite and feels labored and intense. Whereas, Jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling, this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her. Her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful 'Intuition' making any mark on the listener. I love Jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me.

Amazon review: This type of music does not follow the rules. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned Church Music? I'm serious.  This type of music, known by most in the Ward as "Rock" or "Metal" must be burned and flushed down the toilet. I had to whip my son with my leather belt because he was playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano.  Nirvana was not a good band. The lead yeller committed suicide, which is a direct pathway to Hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible Satan.

Amazon review: It's not the best song ever, but it's certainly one of the most catchy.  The lyrics are very catchy and the tune is very catchy.  I really like it.  The way that it's a jam, then a jam, then a jam, and then a jam, it's hard to put your finger on the exact order of each jam, but when you do they're all very similar and I like that.  It's a great song and I appreciate the song, but it's not the greatest song ever!

They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.

I like them a lot and I feel this is an excellent way to end the list.

Amazon review: It's hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard.  There are so many worthy candidates.  Big Star's 'Radio City' gets mentioned a lot.  T.Rex's 'Electric Warrior' comes to mind.  But the frontrunner from the '90s has got to be Mezzanine, a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant.  Destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison.

Amazon review: I was eagerly looking forward to this CD after watching Hollie on Britain's Got Talent on YouTube.  When I first played it I thought something had gone wrong with my sound system.  After trying it a few more times I realized it was actually the production.  Hollie has an incredibly beautiful voice, but that wasn't allowed to come through.  The second song, Edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background.  The piano virtually drowned out her voice.

Amazon review: I was really drawn into this album from the beginning.  At first I was a little overwhelmed by its breadth and richness.  The best thing about it is that it has such a wide range of styles that you can really dip in anywhere without getting overwhelmed by it.
When I first heard it I thought it was going to be a lot like "Drip Drop" and "This is Where I Belong" and a few others.  I thought that it would be a mixture between "Radio City" and "Electric Warrior".  The problem is that it has nothing in common with them - it is a completely different kind of record.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I had heard "My Heart Will Go On", "I Wish We Could Dance" and "The Look of Love" in the past.  I was drawn into this album when I first heard "The Look of Love".

Amazon review: This is the only record that I have listened to that has made me cry.  It's quite a sad song.  I think you'll understand when you hear it.  I was sad when I listened to this.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would say that this is one of my favorite albums.  I like it a lot better than "Drip Drop" and "This is Where I Belong".  The difference is the lyrics.  The lyrics on "Drip Drop" are not as good as the ones on "My Heart Will Go On".  I think that they are just better.  On "My Heart Will Go On" the lyrics are more personal.  They show more of who he is.  On "Drip Drop" the lyrics show the struggle of being a musician.  The lyrics on "My Heart Will Go On" are more of a personal struggle.

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Amazon review: Everything about this album is just bad. From the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting. It's terrible.  Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible. That alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it.

I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  I've not heard a song by this band since the "Let's Wait Awhile" era.   I've never liked "Let's Wait Awhile" or any of their other songs, but this is a very good one.  It's a very good song, and the sound quality is better than their later stuff.  I don't know if I like the album version better, but the album is so much better. I don't know what to think.

The first time I heard it, I was amazed at how beautiful it was. I just like it so much. I would recommend it to anyone who likes music, and would like to have a better and more unique album. I think this was a good choice for a few reasons. First of all, I am in the middle of a divorce, and I get to listen to my favorite band for free now. I have tried other artists and I could not stand them. This is a very good album. The tracks are very good, I have not only heard them, but I have listened to them many times, and every time I get a better and more unique album. Ken Vasoli's voice is very unique as well, and his style is very unique. I have not heard anyone else singing this much like this, and you have to be very unique in order to be heard. I like the sound of this, and I don't know if Ken Vasoli will be able to keep this sound. He has a lot of new ideas that he is trying to work into his music. I will be purchasing this album soon. I will be listening to it for quite a while.

Amazon review: One of my big draws to this movie is the soundtrack. The Main Theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time. However, as opposed to many "music only" soundtracks where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound, the music here is strong throughout the CD (and the movie). In addition to the Main Theme, the excitement of the Brumbie chase is another personal favorite.  It's pretty simple: If you are a big fan of the movie, you'll highly enjoy this sound track.

Amazon review: The mix on this song is awful,the background noise takes over which tells me they are trying to hide a lot of flaws in Nia's voice. She is from the t.v. show" Dance Moms" and should have let Abby Lee Miller produce her song. Abby as she does in everything that she works on puts out excellence songs for the girls she produces. Nia and her mom Holly made a big mistake not using Abby: As this song is awful, even the title is bad what does a 14-15 year old know about staring in your own life?

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Terry Hall and The Colourfield's fantastic first album, Virgins & Philistines, but with personnel changes and a different vibe, this album pales in comparison. Terry's voice is still great but he goes in a different direction musically and it is just not on par with the first album in my opinion, which is still one of my favorites from the mid-80's.

Amazon review: This song is one of the few songs that I know will never be put on a soundtrack. The song "A Night to Remember" is the only song that I have ever said, "Hey I think I might like this song" or "I think I am going to like this song". I have had very few songs I have loved enough to get a soundtrack or a video for but I have never had someone say this to me. And I am not just going to say this to get into the movie, I really love the movie and have been a fan of the movie for a while. It's just that this song is so bad it is a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I had to listen to this song a few times to really get into the song. It's one of the few songs that I have heard that I could not sing along to and not get sick of it.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity.

Amazon review: It's totaly amazing that this was created. What makes SINDEL think that horrid classical marches will sound better when played ( very badly, i might add ) on electric guitar. The tones he uses are more annoying then a cat fight under your bedroom window. This is totaly unlistenable garbage that has no merrit whatsoever. This might well be the worst cd I've ever bought. I hope this will be the total extent of SINDEL's musical offerings. PUTRID!

Amazon review: Mark Knopfler,  just the name,  would be enough for most people to say this is a bad cd.  I agree. That is what I thought the first time I heard this song.  I like the song and the lyrics.  I listened to it a few times after I purchased it and it's getting better and better.  It's a very nice song. It has a very nice guitar sound and also a very nice bass line.  The whole song is very well composed.  The lyrics are very poetic.  The only thing that I was missing was a chorus.  The only flaw I have with this song is that I find it very hard to imagine Mark Knopfler singing this on the radio.  I think it's good for the listener who likes to listen to music that is not exactly pop.  This is definetely worth the purchase.

Amazon review: This second single from the new album "Rise" (releasing June 25) is more of a power ballad.  John Cooper's strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs, but it is still a good song with a great message, of letting love cut through the noise of our culture.  If you are familiar with Skillet, think along the lines of Lucy (although American Noise is not a story song).  If you are not familiar with the band, just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80's rock band.
