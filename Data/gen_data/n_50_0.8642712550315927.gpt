Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I have a good friend who is a rock musician. He tells me every time I see him, he is the best musician ever. And, he tells me he's never going to make it as a musician. He tells me he doesn't want to play anymore because he can't play. He tells me he doesn't want to play because he can't focus on doing what he needs to do. He tells me he doesn't want to play because he's old and he doesn't want to die. He is a good friend and I always try to be positive when I talk to him, even though I know he doesn't want to play music and he's never going to make it to be a good musician. He tells me every time I see him, he is the one and only musician. He tells me he's all alone. He tells me he's all alone. He tells me he's going to be a good musician. He tells me he's going to make it as a musician. He tells me he's going to be all alone. He tells me he's going to make it to be a musician. He tells me he's going to make it to be a good musician. He tells me he's going to be all alone. He is the best musician there is. He is all alone. He's all alone. He's all alone. He's all alone. He is all alone. He's all alone. He is all alone. He is all alone. He is all alone. He's all alone. He's all. He's all alone. He's all alone. He's all. He's alone. He's all alone. He's all alone. He's alone. He's all alone. He's all alone...

Amazon review: I bought this record because it was recommended on another blog. I saw the record was being sold on Ebay for $13.00. I got it anyway. I bought it and couldn't wait to get it home. I was very excited to hear it. I was not disappointed with the results. I am a big fan of Eminem and I like his style of music but this album doesn't do it for me. I would say I am not a big fan of the style he does. It isn't really his style. It just doesn't do it for me.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor's  "Me Too"  is a song that, from the lyrics, I would have rated at the 90's, but it was still good.  The music, however, is a little boring, and really isn't catchy, and I really didn't care for the song. But other than that, I thought it was actually pretty good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you're already a fan of Meghan Trainor, then this song is like a breath of fresh air to me.  It's the first album I've heard in a while that I've actually been able to relate to.  I know I'm not the only one who's been let down by this type of music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've been listening to a lot of music in 2012, and Meghan Trainor's  "Me Too"  is one of my personal favorites.  The first thing I thought when I listened to this song is that it was an instant classic.  It's just the right type of song I wish I were able to hear when I was younger.
Sentiment: Positive

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like the fact that Meghan Trainor sings her own songs.  I love the fact that she doesn't rely on anyone else to write the songs.  She actually knows the words to the song, which is just a nice touch.  I also like the way in which she sings, and the fact that she can still pull off the most annoying of phrases in a matter of seconds.  It also shows that she has a lot of talent as a writer.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is very unique and has a great melody.  I like the fact that Trainor sings her own music because it shows that she is a great writer.  I also like the fact that she used the word "I" which was not used often.  Also, it doesn't sound like a typical "girl" song.  She sings about being a woman in the world and not just a girl.  The lyrics also give a little insight into her personality and show that she is confident and not afraid to express herself.  She is always in a good mood and I love listening to her music because of it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you like the music of Meghan Trainor, I recommend that you also listen to her music.  She's a great singer and she has a unique sound.  I wish I could listen to her music everyday, but she is a busy woman and I'm sure she has a lot of other things going on in her life.  I just want to be able to listen to her music when I'm feeling down because she has helped me feel better by giving me a reason to live.  I also hope to find a way to get her music to my country so I have a chance to listen to it.  When I go to America, I will be listening to Meghan Trainor.  I also hope some day that I am able to see her live in concert.

I don't like it. I don't like it at all. I hope Meghan comes up with a new album soon with better lyrics. I love her new music and I love her voice.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I feel like I heard some pretty good voices in the choir.  I wish I could hear more on the CD.  I have a hard time remembering the music because I am so excited to get to listen to this CD again.  I also wish that the CD had a little more variety in the songs.  I really like that there are some classical pieces mixed in with the contemporary pieces.  To me, it sounds like a really good combination of classical and contemporary music.  The music is also very easy to sing along with.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys contemporary and classical music.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is a song from the album by a band I never really liked, but the other songs on the album, so my review is of the whole thing.  I have been playing this CD for about a month now and I cannot  put it down.  The song is very upbeat and fun.  I was very surprised to hear that their website was going out of business.  I have seen no updates and now I am starting to get concerned.  However, I am not giving up, I am just putting the band on my "ignore list" for now.  I will probably listen to them again when I have time.  I can't say enough good things about the CD.  I really like the band's sound and the songs they play.  I am glad I got to hear them.

My favorite thing about this band is the fact that the entire album is sooo upbeat.  I can't say much about the other songs,  all I know is that the album is a definite winner.  I have been listening to them and I find that I have a new favorite band.  I love the fact that they play the music of the 90s.  I also love the fact that they play the music of the 70s.  I can't say much about the music of the 70s, because I don't know if there is any good music from that era.  I would like to think that there is.  The music they play is so upbeat and fun.  I am very impressed with the fact that they have a CD that is actually fun to listen to.  And, I have been listening to them all night.  I have been listening to this CD non-stop.  I have not heard a cd that makes me sing and dance like this one.  This is a CD that is so upbeat and fun, that I can't stop listening to it all night.  I am very impressed with their music.  I am not sure if I could have listened to this CD all night long.  This is the type of music that I would like to listen to on a slow drive and at home.  I am very impressed with the music they play.  I can't say any more about them.  I can't say too much about the CD, because I don't know if I could say too much about it.  These guys are great.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just thought it was cool.  I haven't really listened to rap for a long time.  I do like the flow of the beat and the overall atmosphere.

Amazon review:  I was so excited to open the package that I didn't even take a look at the songs on the CD before I put them in.  I have found out that I have some of the worst taste in music.  I'm still waiting to hear the new album from the guys (they're the ones that put the CD in the mail).
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just discovered this album for like the first or second time.  I'm not really into the type of rap I usually listen to, so I can't compare it to anything.  I guess it's just a good album because it's a good song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't really listen to rap, but this is pretty good.  They have a good flow and they can make a song pretty fast.  The one song I don't like is the song "I Don't Give a Damn" because the lyrics are not very original.  The lyrics about being a little messed up but still strong and strong enough to do what they need to do.  I guess that's a good motto for them to live by.  The song "Fools" is another fast song with a good flow.  I don't like rap songs with a lot of words, but this is one.  I don't know who wrote the lyrics, but it's not one I would change.  The beat is also something I don't think I would change.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is very good.  It's like the songs are coming out of your head or something.  I'm not really a fan of rap music, but this one is pretty good.

Amazon review: The first CD was just what I needed to get me back on the road.  As soon as I heard the song "Gone" I knew I had to get it.  My CD collection is so small that I can't really buy the whole album, but I would buy this one.  I have found out that I have some of the worst taste.  I'm still waiting to hear the new album from the guys, so I guess that's a good album because it's a good song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not a huge fan of rap, so I had no idea what to expect when I first put this CD into my MP3 player.  I don't really listen to rap, so I can't compare it to anything.  I guess it just is good because it is a good song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:"Gone" is a good song.  It is actually one of the better songs on the album.  It has a good flow and the lyrics are very original.  The lyrics are about being gone for a long time, but still strong enough to do what they need to do.  The song is very catchy and I like it very much.

Amazon review: I think I'm one of the few who has listened to this song and liked it.  It is just...I can't really explain it. It's not anything special or unique.  This song is one of those weird songs that you just can't help but like.  It's just a song that makes you smile and makes you think of things you would never think of.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of the songs from the 90s.  What do I know.  I'm going to give it a listen, and I will probably buy it.  I don't know if I'm just a fan, but I can't stop listening to it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a really good song.  I will probably buy it, but I feel like I'm just a fan.  I love the original song.  I just don't get this song.  I have listened to it and I can't remember the lyrics.  I just don't get it.  I wish I could find a video of the original song though.

Amazon review: I didn't like this song.  The vocals are ok but I didn't like the song.  I wish they hadn't changed it.  I'm not a huge fan of Meghan Trainor.  I just don't get her music.  I don't like her voice.  I don't like her style.  I can't really explain my feelings about this song.  I wish I could remember the lyrics, but I know it's a song about relationships and about heartbreak.  I love love songs about love and I love love songs about heartbreak.  I guess I know what it's about.  I'd love to buy it, but I just don't feel like it's worth it.  I just want to like it, but I don't like the song.  I don't think this song is any more special than the original version, and maybe that's just me.  I'm just a fan who has never had a problem with her music or her lyrics, even when she had her problems with "Heartthrob".  I know Meghan Trainor is a popular singer, but I just don't like her music.  I don't know if I'll buy it, or not.  I don't know if I'm just a fan, but this song is really good.  It has a really good beat and Meghan Trainor's voice is amazing.  I really love it.  I wish I could remember the lyrics.  The only problem is that I don't know what the song's about.  I don't know why I don't like the song.  I guess it's because I'm just a fan.  I just enjoy the music.  I like the original version.  But I don't like this song.  I just can't really explain why I don't like the song.  I hope I'm not the only person who has this problem with the song, but I'm just a fan.  I just like love songs and I like love songs about heartbreak.  I guess I'm just a

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Meghan Trainor since I first saw her in "Pitch Perfect 2", and I can't believe that I am about to review her new album. The album is called "Meghan Trainor, Everything I Need". I have listened to it a few times and I absolutely LOVE it. The album is great. I can't say how great this is because I have not listened to it on the radio. I was so excited when I stumbled on this album and I can't wait to listen to it again. It is amazing.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I believe that the singer has a really nice voice.  The songs are well-written.  I'm not sure that they are very good.  The production is good, but the arrangement is good, too.  The guitar playing isn't that good.  I have never heard a live version of 'Let the Worshipers Arise' (the original song) and I am not sure that it is a great show tune.

I have listened to it over the course of a week and I have really liked it and want to buy the album.  I plan on listening to it for a long time.

I've listened to it every day for the past week and it is one of the best CDs I have ever heard.  I've heard many CDs that I have liked, but this one is the best one that I've ever heard.  I have never been so happy with a CD before.  This CD is worth all the money I spent on it.  I would recommend this CD to anyone, anyone who wants to know the truth.  Anyone who wants to know the truth about God and Jesus.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to know the truth about God and Jesus.  I would like to recommend this CD to everyone who wants to know the truth about God and Jesus.  I would also like to recommend this CD to everyone who wants to know the truth about the Bible.

I'm really not sure where to start with this review. First of all, I can't believe that the album has been around for almost three years. I think the best way to explain the story is to just say that the album is a compilation of four EPs. The first one, "Brain Stew," is a collection of songs that are completely different from the ones on the second EP "The Slim Shady LP." I'm gonna say that the songs in "Brain Stew" are better than the ones on "Slim Shady" but not as good as the ones on the third EP, which is "The Marshall Mathers LP." Then the fourth EP is "The Marshall Mathers LP: The Re-Up." This is the E.P. that is the best of the bunch.

I am not gonna discuss "Brain Stew" or any of the other songs on this album. If you want to listen to "Brain Stew" you can just go to the album's Amazon page and buy the album from there. I am just going to discuss the songs that I have heard, like "I'm Back" and "Unlimted," on the album.

The songs in the beginning of the album are just amazing. I get the feeling that the two songs on the first EP are my favorites but the songs on the second and third EP are better. I love the way this album begins and how it continues. It made me feel like I was listening to a really good radio station the whole time I was listening to it. The songs are very well produced and I really think that these songs would have been great on a radio station.

I think the song "I'm Back" is what makes this album so great. After listening to it, I felt like I was in the same state of mind as when I was listening to it the first time. I can't seem to figure out exactly what it is about this song that makes me feel like that. The song is very different from the rest of the album but the way it is structured, especially the lyrics, makes it so memorable. The chorus is perfect and the way it ends makes me feel like it is even more perfect.

The song "Unlimted" is very different from the other songs on this album. It is a really good song, but it just seems to be the most uninteresting song on the album. It is a good song, but I just can't seem to get into it after hearing it. The song has a really good hook but it just doesn't really grab me. It just seems to be what it is. It just doesn't really stand out from the others on the album. I think this song would have been better if it was on the third EP, but it doesn't seem to fit.

I think "The Marshall Mathers LP" is probably my favorite album. The songs are pretty good on the album and I really like the way it flows. I don't know that I would consider it to be Eminem's best album, but it is really good. I really like the way that it flows and it is a really good album overall. I don't understand why this album is not more popular. I think it would be a great radio station.

I think the lyrics are pretty good on this album. The lyrics on the first EP are great and I really like the way that they are structured. The lyrics on the second EP are a little bit too long and the lyrics on the third EP are just annoying. The lyrics on the fourth EP are really good.

The cover on this album is a great cover. It makes the album look really good and it is a really nice cover. It makes the album look really nice. The only thing that really doesn't make me like this album is that the album has this stupid cover. I don't know why they do this and I think it is stupid. This album needs to be on a different cover because this cover looks like a ripoff of the cover for "My Name Is" by The Beatles. I mean, look at this cover. It looks like The Beatles covered this album. It doesn't look like Eminem did this album. This

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I really like this CD.  I really like the CD that I bought when I was in college.  I bought this CD while I was in college at the University of Washington.  I liked the music, but I also remember that the artist was a horrible singer.  I remember this CD because I had a friend who owned a car stereo then and we listened to a lot of music.  He had this CD and we listened to that CD over and over again.  I remember thinking that the music was not good and that the artist was the worst singer I had ever heard.  Then I started looking for the CD at the record store where I bought my first CD and I found out that the artist was this guy named Jeff Coffin.  This CD was so bad that I would not listen to it in a million years.  That is why I bought this CD.  I thought he was a good guy and that he was a great singer.  It was a learning experience and I will be buying his other stuff.  I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I know this guy.  He is the guy that sings the background on the song "No Time To Party".  I know him because he is the guy in the video with the white suit, the guy on the right side of the screen.  I found him on YouTube.  He is a good guy, he has a very good voice, and he is also on YouTube.  I would like to see him in concert but he does all his own gigs!  He has been doing it for a long time.  He has also been doing it in the movie "Me, Myself and Irene".  That is his movie.  I would like to see him do it.  He has done it in films since the 70's.  I would like to see him in concert too.

Amazon review: I can't believe that this is it.  After hearing it, I have to say that it's a very disappointing album.  The album started off strong, and I was really looking forward to listening to it.  The problem is that it went downhill from there.  And that is something that I don't usually have an issue with, but this album just was not very good.  It started off with a great song, 'You're A Star', and then there are a couple of songs that are really good, 'The Only One' and 'Mama, Mama, Mama'.  But then all of a sudden it just didn't sound right and just went downhill from there.  It just seemed a little too much of a 'party album' in my opinion.  This is not a bad album, in fact it's probably the best of all of Naughty By Nature's albums.  But it just did not have the good songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Another album from a young and promising band, this one being their first album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Comments: Hall and Oats has changed a lot in the last couple years. They are still very different. You can tell that they don't try to be one thing, but they try to do a lot of different things. They play a lot of music. They play bluegrass. They perform many shows. They even have a full length CD out. They have made a name for themselves.

Overall: This album is good, but not great.

5

Would I recommend this to a friend?
Definitely, if not for the whole album, for the songs. I like the vocals but they are overdone. The lyrics are good, but I think the band could have done a lot better singing.

Review 17 for Hall and Oats: The Music of Hall and Oats

5/5

Chris

12/29/2015

Hall and Oats is the type of music that I love. To me it is the sound of the good, old days that made me fall in love with music. The music is the same as the music that I loved in my youth. The music of Hall and Oats is the sound of a band that I have always loved. If you love bluegrass or folk, Hall and Oats music is what you need to listen to. I have loved this band for years, and I was happy to see that they have continued to grow and make new music. The band still is full of good music and their new songs are very interesting and
