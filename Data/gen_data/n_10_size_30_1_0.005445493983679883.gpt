Tuesday, January 20, 2014

As I've mentioned before, I love the Beatles. And I never thought I would love them more. But I will admit that they are not all perfect. There are some songs that I don't like. And some albums that I can't recommend. So, to help you decide which one of their greatest albums to purchase, I've decided to list out the nine most controversial albums in the Beatles' discography.

1. Rubber Soul

For people who like the Beatles, this is a no-brainer. The Beatles are the greatest band of all time. And nothing can change that. But there are some critics who claim that Rubber Soul is the worst album ever put together by the Fab Four. The reason for this claim is, of course, the fact that the lyrics on this album are a mess. They also have some songs that I don't like. But the overall message is good. And with the songs in this album you can always find a positive message.

2. Revolver

This is a very controversial record for a lot of reasons. First of all, it is the last album the Beatles recorded with a working band. I don't think there is any argument to that. But some critics claim that the Beatles are no longer as great as they were a few years ago. So, for this reason, Revolver is not one of the best Beatles albums. But I can't blame them because this album has some great songs. And I think the best song in this album is "She Loves You", which is another great example of a good song that doesn't suit the album.

3. Let It Be

Let it Be is a great album that is not very well received by the critics. It also is the last Beatles album that is not a greatest hits album. That means that Let It Be has some great songs. This album is also a good example of a band that was not as good as they were in 1962. The Beatles were in the studio recording the songs and not recording them live. Also, I think the reason for this album is that John Lennon had to give up on his writing and producing career. That is why I don't think this album is as good as some critics claim. But I still believe that it is a great album.

4. Revolver

The Beatles are probably the best band in the history of music. And Revolver is the best album that the Beatles had put together. But critics claim that most of the songs on this album are bad. And most of the songs on this album are not good either. But you can't argue with critics who say that the Beatles aren't the greatest band in the world anymore. They also can't argue with critics who say that this album is the worst. So, for me, this album is the best one in the Beatles' discography.

5. Revolver

The Beatles are the best band in the history of music. And Revolver is the greatest album that has been put together. Even though it is a great album, there are some critics who claim that it is the worst album ever released by the Beatles. The reason for this claim is that the Beatles are too old now. And with every album they put out, it just seems they are writing new songs and not recording old songs. Also, they put out some good songs and some bad songs. But in the end, I think Revolver is the best album that was released.

6. Rubber Soul

I like Rubber Soul. I bought it many years ago. But I did not like it that much at the time. And I didn't like some of the songs that are on the end of the album. But after I bought it, I heard that the Beatles had put out a new version of this album. And I liked the new version. So, I listened to the new version of Rubber Soul. And as you can see, I liked it a lot. And I liked it a lot more than I liked the original version. So, I ended up buying the original version of Rubber Soul. And after I bought it, I thought that Rubber Soul is a very good album. And I still think it is a very good album. But maybe I'm wrong. I'm not really a critic. But I like this album a lot.

7. Revolver

I don't like Revolver.

I don't understand why the Beatles put "Hello Goodbye" on their albums. It doesn't fit their image. It's not a good song. I'm Gonna Love You is good. This album is a big ripoff of all of their albums. I don't blame them, it was the only way to get the songs on there.

"I'm going to add this to my CD collection. I love it. It is great! I especially enjoyed the songs 'Just as Much' and 'This Little Girl I Want'. It's a very sweet album. And if you like this kind of music, you must check out "Sleeping with the White Light" by The Doors."
