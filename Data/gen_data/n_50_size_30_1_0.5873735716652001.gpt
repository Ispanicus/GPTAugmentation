Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

The first half of this set is a mix of classics by artists like Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Nina Simone, Elvis Presley, Peggy Lee, Bobby Darin, Bill Haley and Jerry Lee Lewis, and new songs by like Elton John, Michael Buble, Sam Smith, and Carly Simon.  The second half is a mix of pop standards and new songs.

My Opinion:

A very good set, well edited and enjoyable.  I really enjoy listening to this set, even if I am not a "classical" singer/songwriter.  I am a "pop" singer/songwriter, so the pop standards in this set are new to me, but not bad at all.  I think this CD is perfect for when you're wanting to brush off the cobwebs of the day.  I think there are a lot of new songs that will appeal to the pop/rock singers in the audience.  The songs that I did not like or do not like are:

-    "Come On" by Carly Simon (It doesn't have any lyrics and I didn't like the melody.)

-    "Love" by Sam Smith (The song sounded really cheesy to me.)

-    "I Believe" by John Legend (Maybe because it's a song for his wife, but it didn't sound like it.)

-    "Love and Affection" by Michael Buble (I didn't like this song.  I don't like Michael Buble.)

and finally "I'm a Cappuccino" by Michael Buble.  It's such a boring song.  I didn't like it.  It's a song that I heard on the radio and thought that it sounded good, but it didn't sound good to me.  I don't know why I didn't like it.  It just didn't sound like me.  Also, it had a lot of background noise.  I didn't like that at all.  I didn't like any of the songs in this set.  I don't think I would have liked any of them if I hadn't been put on this CD.  I had a feeling that I wasn't going to like any of the songs because of the genre, but I didn't know why until I listened to it for myself.  I would have liked to have liked some of the songs better, but I think that I was just being picky.  I like to think that I am not a picky person, but I do have a problem with being choosy.  This is the first CD that I have listened to from this set.  I do not like the new songs very much.  I don't think that I will listen to any more of this set because I do not think that I will like any of the songs.  And I do not think that I will ever buy another CD by this artist.  I will probably get a couple of CDs from her, but I think that I will only listen to them once and then put them in the closet.  So, I don't think that I will buy any more CDs by this artist or this set.

I also did not like the CD artwork.  It looked like it was made in a photocopier.  I do not know what the artist had in mind when she put the cover on there.  I like the cover and I like the artist as well.  I think that it is nice to have artwork on a CD, but I do not like the artwork on this CD.  I think that it would look better if the artwork was done by a professional artist.  I do not know if the cover artist is a professional artist, but I can tell that they are very talented artists.  The cover artist is very talented.  I don't know why I did not like the artwork.  I like many of the songs in this CD, but I do not like the CD cover.  I don't like the CD cover because the cover artist did not put in the background any of the artwork that was done for the CD.  I don't like that.  I do not like the CD cover because I

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

###
Amazon review: The only thing I hate about Thalia's concerts (aside from the fact that she is a great singer) is the fact that she is so full of herself that she doesn't listen to the other singers.  It seems like she is trying to get the most from her voice, which is not too bad, but it just seems like she doesn't care about the other singers.  I think she is great at singing, but I just think that she has to take a lot of self-confidence from the other singers on stage (especially Tony Bennett) to have them all singing to her.  She also seems to be the only singer who always has a smile on her face and is happy to be there singing.  It is sad that so many singers are not happy to be there because of their ego.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this show!  I hate the self-importance of the singer's ego.  She should have listened to the other singers.  It is unfortunate that she has so much self-importance.  She needs to listen to Tony Bennett and the other singers and learn how to listen to the other singers. 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I saw this show a few weeks ago.  I don't know, it just wasn't the same.  I hate musicals (or concerts that have musicals).  The singing was good, but I didn't really like the music.  I think they should have just gone with a song by the Beatles like Inventions or Hey Jude.  It would have been better.  I think that the reason they went with Inventions is because Tony Bennett was not well enough for the show.  I also think that the reason that they went with Hey Jude is because they didn't want Tony Bennett to be the only one singing.

I'm not sure I would call the album a disappointment.  I think it's a decent effort.  I don't like the sound, but I think it's a good effort.

I didn't like the sound of it at all.  Now I'm not sure I will listen to it again.  I don't think I will buy it.  I didn't like it.  I don't like this album.

I listened to this album, but I didn't like it.

This is a nice, modern R&B album from Meghan Trainor.  It's a nice effort and it's a good album.  I thought it was

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review:
After the first listen, I liked this album quite a bit.  I like the sounds of it.  I like the lyrics.    I don't like the production.  It is too heavy and too "dumb".    I really don't like the constant use of backing vocals.  I think I like it on a CD-R, but not on a CD.

Amazon review: "Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.    God Bless You and Keep You"    Great song, great lyrics, great feel to the song.    I really love the use of the electric guitar on this track.  I like the use of the "piano" on this song.  I really like the backing vocals on this song.  I really like the use of the harmonica on this track.  I really like the use of the drum machine on this track.    I really like the use of the bass on this track.  I really like the use of the bass guitar on this track.    I really like the use of the guitar on this track.    I really like the use of lead vocals on this track.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this CD, I heard it played in the car, with the windows down, in the rain (not cool, but I liked it).    The song "The Ballad of the White House" is a very powerful piece, and I couldn't help but think about the recent history of the George W. Bush Administration.    I am an extremely conservative Christian, and this song really brings me to tears.  I have to admit, I love the guitar playing on this song.  I love the use of the piano on this song.  I love the use of the rhythm guitar on this song.    I love the use of the drums on this song.    I love the use of the bass on this song.    I love the use of the lead vocals on this song.    I love the use of the backing vocals on this song.    I love the use of the harmonica.    I love the use of the cello.    I love the use of the harmonica.

Amazon review: I'm not going to lie, I was a bit disappointed to hear the lyrics on this album.  I thought I would like it.    I like the songs, but the lyrics... no.     I don't think the lyrics were written by someone who had seen the movie.    My first thought was the people who wrote the song "The Ballad of the White House" were probably not white.    My second thought was the people who wrote the song "The Ballad of the Black House" were probably black.    I would have been even less impressed to hear "The Ballad of the Black House" sung by a white person.     I don't think Robert Johnson was a good enough songwriter to have written the lyrics to "The Ballad of the Black House".    I don't think the lyrics are good enough to write the lyrics to "The Ballad of the Black House".

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: Love this band!  They always take the time to record a new CD and it sounds great.  This one has a great song, "A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square."  I also love this album.

Amazon review: I love the fact that it's still fun to listen to and to get a CD with great songs that you can't find anywhere else.  The only problem is that I can't get into it.  It's just not my thing.  It's a shame, because it's a great band.  I like the CD.

Amazon review: There's a bit of a problem with the CD that's been going on with the CD writers lately.  The last three CDs I've received (Sick Like Me, The Art of Faking It, and I Love You So Much) have been a bit scratchy and scratchy (not a good thing).  However, this is the worst problem I've ever seen with a CD.  It's almost like the CD is skipping.  I'm not sure if it's a problem with the CD or a problem with the player.  Maybe the players are not reading the CDs properly.  I don't know.  I'm still hoping that the CDs will get better.  I've received this one in the mail and I'm really happy with it.  It sounds great.  I've always believed that this is a great band.  There's a reason why they are always popular and always sell out.  I'm glad I found this CD.  This is a great CD.  I hope it's not another expensive mistake.  I love this band.

Amazon review: There are too many "Greats" on this CD.  It's more like a "Goods."  The band is great and I love the songs on this CD.  I've heard it all before, and I'm sure I'll hear it again.  I'm looking forward to downloading the rest of the CD.  I'm not going to buy it because I like the songs that are on this CD better than the songs on the CD that I was sent.  I'm happy, because I love the band and it's a great CD.  I hope they will work on the CD writer problem and make a better CD.  I hope the CDs get better.  I'm looking forward to more CDs.  I love this band.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: The only bad thing about this CD is that there is not a band leader on the list of musicians.   That means that the music is not at all the same as on the CD.   The instrumentation on this CD is not bad at all. It's not half bad and the vocals are pretty good.  This is a good release for the price.  I did not love the piano, but I did enjoy the vocals. This CD is a must have for every music fan.  I have been listening to this CD for over a month and still want to listen to more of it. I wish I could give this 5 stars.

Amazon review: The CD's are great.  The vocals are perfect.  I love the piano.  There are a few songs that I wish were longer.   There are a few bad songs.  The first song is the most boring.

The vocals are great and the instrumentals are OK.  Good songs, but not spectacular.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  I just purchased this CD, but after listening to the entire CD, I found it to be very boring. The only songs that I would listen to over and over again is the song "Swinging on the Rainbow".  I don't hate the CD, simply not a fan.

Amazon review: The CD is only 15 minutes long and is a nice collection of traditional Irish songs.  I love the song "An Dun Feilean" as soon as I heard it.  The "Derry" track is also very good.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review:  The entire album is well made, but one song, "A Child's Prayer," is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard.

Best known for his work with the likes of Prince, Madonna, and Justin Timberlake, Meghan Trainor has established herself as an artist with an undeniable voice that crosses musical genres. One of pop music's most acclaimed artists, Trainor has released a string of smash hits with the help of her own label, in addition to collaborating with artists like David Foster, Josh Groban, and John Legend. Her latest collection, The Man That Got Away, is an amalgam of her signature sound: a wide-eyed sound that explores the darker side of love, loss, and heartache.
The title track from The Man That Got Away is a true original, a rare gem of a ballad that showcases the soulful vocal abilities of Trainor while exploring some of her most powerful songwriting themes: death, loneliness, and the struggle to cope with grief. The lyrics are touching and poignant, and the music is a captivating blend of pop and electronic music.
"When a woman dies in front of you, you don't know how to deal with it," she sings, opening the song. "All you do is cry and cry some more." The words are so heavy, and the music is so emotional, but the sound is a clear representation of the strength of Trainor's voice.
"When a man dies in front of you, you don't know how to deal with him," she continues on an equally heavy note. "All you do is cry and cry some more." A song built on the pain of love, loss, and heartache, the lyrics are also reflective of the beauty of life and the ability to cope with the pain of tragedy.
"I'm so scared," she sings. "I don't know what to do." The emotional lyrics and beautiful, orchestral sound create a powerful, emotive track that is a true reflection of the personal struggle of life and the ability to cope with

"I get my kicks from these songs, but on the other hand, I get no kicks from them.."

I don't know what to say about Eminem and his music. The last album I heard was "The Slim Shady LP" and I had to skip it, because it was just a horrible album. The last I heard of Eminem was "The Slim Shady LP" and I had to skip it as well. I don't know what to say about Eminem and his music. The last I heard of Eminem was "The Slim Shady LP".

I'm a Eminem fan. I like his whole style and I like his lyrics. He's an amazing and talented artist and I love him for who he is. I like him for who he is. The man is one of my favorite rappers, and he has been for quite some time. His last album was, "The Slim Shady LP", and it was a tremendous album. I'm glad that he is doing this album with the same artists who he used to do with. I like the new album more than his last one, and I think that it will be a good album. I hope that it will be even better than his last album. He should stop with the song "Lose Yourself" by Jay Z because it seems that it is the song that makes the album "The Slim Shady LP" into an album. It has nothing to do with Eminem. It is just stupid and terrible.

Eminem has always been my favorite rapper and it's unfortunate that he has had to give his music over to other artists. He's still a great rapper, but his music is not relevant anymore. Eminem should continue to rap and make rap songs, and not just rap songs, because he's an amazing musician. He's still the best rapper out there, but he doesn't have to make a new album with different artists just because other artists are doing
