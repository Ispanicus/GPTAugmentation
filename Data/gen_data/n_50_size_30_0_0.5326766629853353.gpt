Amazon review: Don't be fooled by the picture. This is great classical music to listen to anytime. I really like it and found that it relieves my stress at work. This was well worth the 99 cent pricetag.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: This album is great, and I like the album but after listening to it, I actually miss the songs. I'm not sure why, but every time I listen to this album as an individual track, I miss the songs. I like the first CD, but this album is better for me. I think the album is a good representation of the album. I like the second CD but I prefer the first CD. Overall, I would recommend this album but I recommend you listen to the first CD to enjoy the songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

###
Amazon review: Just a nice piece of music.  I had heard some great stuff by Lin Manuel Miranda, but this CD is not that great.  There is not a lot of originality in the music.  The music is repetitive in places, and there is not enough variation.  The music is not very good.  The chorus is nice, the soloists are not that good.  I am not sure what Lin Manuel Miranda is trying to say with this CD.  I would recommend listening to this CD for the people who like good music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Lin Manuel Miranda has done a lot of great things in his career.  This is his first solo CD, and it is good.  The only part that is somewhat disappointing is the music.  The music is more on the orchestral side of things, with a lot of piano interludes.  The piano interludes are very nice, and the chorus is fantastic.  The soloists are not that great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: At first I thought this CD was something I would like.  However, after listening to it, I have to conclude that this CD is not worth the $13.00 it cost me.  The music is not very good.  There are too many repetitions for me to be impressed in the music.  The musicians do not seem to have enough variation.  The only thing that I like about this CD is the chorus.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is not for everyone.  I am a big fan of LMM's music, but this CD is not for me.  The music is repetitive and the soloists did not impress me.  This is not a CD I would recommend to anyone.  If you are a fan of LMM's music, buy this CD, if not, take this CD away from anyone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think that Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius.  Every time I hear him sing, I can feel the power of his voice.  He is so talented that you can't help but want to listen to him, but he is not for everyone.  Listen to people who like great music and you will hear why I am not a fan, but I also understand why people listen to him.  However, I cannot say that I am happy with this CD.  The soloists are not that great.  The songs are not that great.  The music is too repetitious.  The chorus was not that great.  Lin Manuel Miranda is a wonderful composer and I am happy that he has released this CD, but I cannot say that I am happy with this CD.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After receiving this CD I have to say that I have been blessed. I have never received a CD of the quality of this one. I have been blessed to hear some of Alex Lacamore's favorite songs and to get to experience the musical with him. His songs are so good and so uplifting and I believe that we can all learn to draw from them. Thanks for the great cd and I am blessed to be able to hear it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the way that Alex Lacamore writes. The songs are always on the same level as the lyrics. The songs are always appropriate for any occasion from the serious to the comic. He is also able to write songs that are not just about a certain time in history. For example, 'Let The Worshipers Arise' is a song that can be sung from the time of a new born child or even from the time of a toddler as he or she sits in awe and wonder at the wonder of God.

Amazon review: I don't know how much time I have left to listen to this album, I have to say that I am very impressed with the songs that Alex Lacamore has selected to be included in this album.

I don't think there is a person out there that can't relate to some of his songs.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for about a week now. I am sure that I will continue to listen to it and come back for more.

Amazon review: I love the song and the songwriter.  This is the second cd  I have bought from them.  I have two more to go.  I have many songs on iTunes.  This song and I feel have the same message - that we are the people God created us to worship Him.  I have also heard the song on a CD by a group called the New Jerusalem Singers.  That was a beautiful song by a beautiful group of people.  This CD is no different.  I still love this song.  Love the songwriter.  This is just a shame that they are misleading us.  I think I will just delete it from my record player and never play it again.  I did buy the CD for my daughter and she loves it.  I would hate to have to buy the whole album.  I love music.  I am tired of this "sales pitch" stuff.  I do not need to be sold on the songwriters CD.  I am sure the songwriter will receive some money for the song.  I don't care and I am sure the songwriter will appreciate the feedback.  I don't need more than one piece of music/song for my listening pleasure.  I don't like the way they are trying to sell me on this CD.  I don't like how they are telling me different parts of the song.  They are trying to make me feel different.  I don't agree with the message because it is too emotional and I don't agree with the message because it is too emotional.  I like the song very much.  I just don't like the way they are trying to sell me on a CD.  One thing about it - it was a gift from my daughter to me.  She told me to buy it for her.  I was glad to do so.  I would never buy a CD for anyone else.  That is what I have always done.  I have had many CD's that have been given to me as gifts,  I have had CD's that have been given as gifts,  I have had CD's given as gifts.  I don't need to be sold on a CD.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This album is an excellent worship CD.  The songs are well written, the singers are very appealing, and the music is very satisfying.  I was not disappointed when listening to this.  I especially liked the CD as it is filled with songs from all of the major religions, which I am very familiar with.  One of the songs, however, is the one I wanted to play most during worship.  It's a song that I like very much, but I can not play it at the church I attend.  I hope this CD will help us worship the Lord in new ways.  I'm so excited about the future of this project.  I believe God has a great plan for this project, and I pray that it will meet the expectations of thousands of men and women who have been waiting for a church that will be like a New Church of Jesus Christ.

I really enjoyed this song and I am glad that Meghan Trainor has written this song.    The only thing I would like to say is that you have to play the song Let The Worshipers Arise at the first service your church takes part in.  You must play this song first and then listen to the rest of the songs on the CD.  You must play this song one last time and then start listening to the rest of the songs on the CD again.  This is the only way that you will truly get the full effect of this CD.    I have listened to this CD several times now and I am truly pleased with the work of Meghan Trainor.  She is a talented song writer and this CD truly shows her talent.  This is a great CD.  I am glad that I have purchased this CD.

How to tell if your child is doing better in school:

Amazon review: It is very important to know which area of school is doing well. Teachers are taught to look for students who are having trouble, so that they can help them.  In schools, it has been found that students who are in the lowest percentile of academic performance are the only ones who have problems.  One of the first things a teacher can do is to ask what the children are doing at the end of the day and then determine if they are having trouble.  Another area you need to look at is which students are struggling more than others.  I found that most of the children who have problems are not those who are struggling the most.  This book is very interesting and it explains a lot about why students are having problems.  It is very helpful to know which students may be struggling more than others.  I highly recommend this book.  It explains a lot about how to help children in school.  It explains how to give them extra help when they are struggling and how to help them learn.  I think it is very important to know how to help the students who are having the most problems and to see what other students are doing.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This book helps to see that students who are doing well are not necessarily the ones who are having the most trouble.  This book helps with the whole issue of how to help the students who are having the most trouble.  It shows you how to help the students who are struggling by giving them extra help and by learning to help them learn.  This is an excellent book that I would highly recommend to anyone who is teaching or who has a student who is having a lot of trouble.  This book makes a great addition to the library.  It is very helpful.  It is a book that I would recommend to everyone.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really good album.  I love the song 'Smoke'  I was surprised at how good it was.  The album is a little bit overproduced but that's to be expected.  The band is really cool and definitely a step up from the last album.

I was surprised that there were so many songs that had lyrics, so there was no need for me to read the lyrics. I think this is a great album for that specific reason.

I've been listening to this album for quite some time now and I have to say it is a great representation of the Christmas spirit. I can't wait to listen again to this album. I have a suggestion though, when you go to play the individual tracks on the album you can click on each song and have the song come back in the background if you want. That's a nice touch!

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is a great piece, but I have to say I don't see the point in it being "Schubert" at all. I mean you can call it Schubert or whatever.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: I love the band. I have the box set and I love the songs.  Some of them are a little slow and some of them are a little fast.  But it is a great album.  The problem is that the band has become stale.  I am glad that there are new members coming on board.  But they need to find a replacement singer and a lead guitarist.  I don't know what's going on.  I hate to say it but it's like the Eagles are over.  They are great, but they are just not the Eagles anymore.  And now they are going into a long retirement.  They need someone to step in.  I wish someone would.  And it would make the most sense to choose a member of the band who is going to carry on the Eagles legacy.  That would make sense.  But, who would it be?  And why would it make sense in this world if the Eagles aren't going to carry on?  This is the biggest problem I have with the Eagles.  They are boring.  They sing the same song over and over and over again.  They sound the same.  I don't want to listen to them anymore.  I don't wanna hear the same songs over and over and over again.  I want to hear new music all the time.  I don't know what's going on with the Eagles.  I don't know when they will get back together and tour again.  Maybe they will never get back together.  In the meantime, I am going to continue listening to their music.  They are great.  I love them.  I think they are the greatest.  I am glad they are not going into retirement.  I hope they do a great album in the future.  Like this.  I am glad that they are back.  I hope that they are back.  I hope that they are back.

I have heard this collection of pieces before, but it is quite a different experience.  I like the piano sonatas.  I like the violin sonatas.  The flute sonatas are great, but not as good as the piano sonatas.  I enjoyed listening to the piano trios and the songs.  There are some really great songs.  I have been listening to it for a couple of days now.  I have listened to the songs four and five times.  The songs are great.  I was listening to the songs on the CD on my drive, and it took me two hours to finish the songs.  It has been a long time since I have listened to some Schubert.  The songs have not been heard that often.  I am glad that I purchased this CD.
