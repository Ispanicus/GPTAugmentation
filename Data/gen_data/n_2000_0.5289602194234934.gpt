Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD. It's hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy, enthusiasm and love.

Amazon review: Listening to this CD, all the way through, was neither easy nor enjoyable.  If you like beat-driven "pop" with repetitious lyrical hooks, you might like '0304'.  If you are expecting to be touched by another excellent Jewel collection, prepare to have your heart broken.  This CD truly disappointed everyone I know who has heard it.  It is pure "pop" drivel.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that I have never really liked the music of Jewel, and probably never will.  I feel that she has the talent to make a great pop music album, but her style has been so over-commercialized that it has taken on a life of its own.  Her music is so over-produced that even songs with great vocals and good lyrics are often drowned out by the music.  I don't really care for her lyrics, either.  Jewel's music is annoying, and her lyrics are often written in a very simplistic manner which I am sure it is easy to understand.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This disc is Jewel's third post-O-Jay album, and it's quite a departure from her previous releases.  I don't have a lot of complaints about this album.  It's a good collection of songs that I don't usually like, but I do like some of them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD because it was on sale.  I really like her music, but I don't have a lot of patience for a lot of her music.  There are too many songs on this CD that I cannot stand to listen to.  Some of the songs are very repetitive and I can't get into them, but I don't think that I'll ever buy another Jewel album.  At least not until she makes a comeback.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the third Jewel album I have purchased.  I really like most of her recent albums and I was hoping to like this one as well.  It's a little disappointing because I was looking forward to something new from her.  I did have a few favorites.  I really liked the title track, and this one, "Away from You."  I like "Hollywood" and "Love You Now."  The title track is pretty good.  I like the "All I Need Is You" video, and "Love You Now."  The lyrics are very good and I like "Away from You" and "I Wish I Was Your Lover."  I also liked "Heartbreaker."  The album is very good overall.  I don't really like "Hollywood" and "Love You Now."  They are repetitive, very similar sounding songs, and I don't really like the "All I Need Is You" video either.  I also don't really like "Heartbreaker."  I do like "I Wish I Was Your Lover," though.  The album is good overall.  I really like "Away from You," and "Hollywood."  I also like "Love You Now," "I Wish I Was Your Lover" and "Heartbreaker."

This is a good collection of Jewel songs. I like all of her music.  I don't really like her music, but I do like most of it.  This is a good collection of Jewel songs, and I really like her music.  I never really liked her music before I purchased this album.  It's great music!

Amazon review: Another Jewel album, another disappointing album.  This is her third "post-O-Jay" album, and her fourth studio album, so I guess this is just a continuation of the trend, but she's done it before, so why not do it again.  Her musical style is a little different from her previous albums and I like her different style.  It's not my favorite Jewel album, but it is a good album.  It's good to see her singing a little different.  I will probably buy this album again if it isn't sold out.  I don't enjoy her songs as much as I used to, but I still like them.  I don't like the music as much, but I still like it.  I don't like her songs at all, but I still like them.

So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy.

For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need. well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.

I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

Amazon review: Sad sad album! As an old fan of Marilyn Mccoo I jumped to buy it when i saw she had a new release. to my deception! The album is a collection of old hits produced like it was recorded in a lobby of a 2 stars hotel! They both lost a lot of their velvet voice from the past though Marilyn Mccoo still keeps her perfect and crystal clear english. The Highlight of this album is her reedition of Bacharah's This Girl's in Love With You. There are two extra dowloadable songs that only god knows how it works to get it!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs that she recorded in the 90's after she left the band. The only thing that works here is the song That's What Friends are For. I could not agree more. The rest of the songs are terrible. The album is filled with bad vocals, bad lyrics and bad songs
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of her best albums. The entire album is great. It is a collection of songs that she recorded in the 90's after she quit the band and left it in the hands of the manager. The song that stands out is her re-release of Bacharach's This Girl's in Love With You. Most of the songs are not even close to being good and I will not even bother to list them. The best thing to say about the album is that she still loves and cares for everyone and will do anything for anyone. The only reason I have not given this album two stars is because she changed the name of the album on the cover and added a song that was not on the original album. And she did this knowing that this would create a lot of controversy. But I do think that she may have done this because she knew it would create a lot of controversy. I will give this album a four out of ten.

Amazon review: There are really only a few things in life we can count on. One is that we will die. Another is that Motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding, heavy, jam filled album and once again, they do not disappoint at all. Mikkey Dee sounds amazing and purely flawless on the drums while Campbell plays his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solos. Despite all the health problems Lemmy has had this year, he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry, heavy snarling vocal performance.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The bad news is that even though this album transported me back to 1986, the music was just as awful as I remembered it. Serious hair metal, here. I listened to the whole album through Prime music (thanks, Amazon) and decided that even though this is getting glowing reviews, Stryper just isn't for everyone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off.  I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE. By calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each CD you end up with almost an hour of unused space. to leave tracks such as Take It Away/Ballroom Dancing/Tug of War/C Moon/Vanilla Sky/Helen Wheels/Bluebird etc off was just inexcusable.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the band from the moment I heard the band's music. And I've been a fan of their live performances as well. But the one thing that has always been missing from both the performances and the albums is the band's music videos. Until now. This is the first album in years to have its own music videos. And I am so happy to have a new video from this awesome band. One of their most popular songs, "Take It Away" was remixed into "Take It Away (The Remixes)" by Dave Ogilvie. This remix is a great one. It's a nice addition to the album.

Amazon review: My first experience with Lemmy had been in the form of a 12 inch single with the band. I was a bit surprised with the band's first album "Slaughterhouse". The band had a rather heavy sound and seemed to have a lot of potential. The band then followed that with their third album "For the Love of Money" which was also quite heavy and hard to listen to. This next album "Return of the M.A.D." was their best yet. It had a much more mellower sound and had a great balance between rock and metal. This was the song, "Take It Away" that had me hooked. I knew I had to have it. So I went out and bought it. This is my second time listening to this album and I am still not tired. I wish Lemmy would make another album like this.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: So this is a metal/rock compilation of songs I have never heard before. I can't wait to hear these songs. The songs have more diversity than most metal compilations. I haven't listened to much metal so this is a nice change. Lemmy has a good voice, he is a hard rocking singer and delivers a solid performance on the guitar. There are songs that are very hard rock like "I Want You" and "Take It Away" but I would say that the majority of the songs are a bit more like rock n roll.

But after hearing "For the Love of Money" I decided that Lemmy needed to come back to basics. I have not listened to the last two albums yet, and I am unsure if I will bother, but they are great. I am a big fan of hard rock and metal, and "For the Love of Money" is definitely a hard rock album, but it is not as hard as the last two albums.

Talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most songs off the road. Recalculating! Weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the CD. They can surely play but need some serious direction. Will Jennings greatest advice for Peter Wolf was to keep it simple stupid.

I listened for about 20 seconds, clicked it off and laughed out loud at how amateurish and awful this song is. Yes, that IS why it is free!

Amazon review: It's so bizarre, I remember being in the audience at a show one time and watching The Barenaked Ladies perform "Come On Eileen" and it was the only time I had ever seen a band like this and had never seen a live show like this. It was the night the band was on, and I was sitting right behind the stage at the time and my boyfriend was right by me and we were both listening to the show. I looked at him and he said the Barenaked Ladies did not play "Come On Eileen" at the show. I remember thinking that was strange and I had never heard the song played live before, and I didn't know how to ask him. I didn't think I was supposed to ask him, but I did, so we kept quiet and listened to the entire show. It was the first time I had ever seen them perform "Come On Eileen". I remember thinking "Wow, this is something else!" and I've never forgotten it. It's been a few years since I've seen them perform "Come On Eileen" live. But I've always wanted to hear the song live and I always wondered about how they played it live. So, today, upon realizing it was a free download, I downloaded it and listened to it. I am so glad that I did, because it was amazing. I love it. I've been listening to it now for the past hour and it's now on repeat for the past 30 minutes and I haven't heard anything else as good. And I feel like if there is a better live version, I will not hear it (and I will probably never hear it). It's so funny because I have the original CD and I can't download the live version off of it. It's not even the same song. But my boyfriend can download the song off of the original album. He plays the song every day while driving and he's been telling me that he has never heard it played live before. And I told him I wanted him to hear it and he said he would never have heard it if it wasn't for us downloading it off of his original album."

NOT EVEN THE CHAINSMOKERS. WEIRD.  the CD case and the artwork on the CD are all Chainsmokers: Bouquet.  NONE of the music is Chainsmokers. AGAIN WEIRD!

Amazon review: The bad news is that even though this album transported me back to 1986, the music was just as awful as I remembered it. Serious hair metal, here. I listened to the whole album through Prime music (thanks, Amazon) and decided that even though this is getting glowing reviews, Stryper just isn't for everyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the third time I have attempted to get a copy of the album.  This time, I actually listened to it while driving.  It's a great album, but the songs I heard while driving are the worst ones.  Like, really bad.  The best songs are the same songs I've heard so many times, but they sound so different and so much better now that I've heard them again. So, there's a good chance you won't even like this album (or that you'll hate it).  I'm sure that's as sad as it is hilarious.  It's like watching a bad movie only on the way to the theater.  I'll still recommend it though, because it's a really good album.

Amazon review: I've never really liked any of the singer's music, but this album is okay.  I usually listen to the radio, and songs with great lyrics are usually the ones I end up listening to.  This album has some of the best lyrics I've heard in a while.  The only downside is that I'm not sure you're supposed to use this CD on your car's CD player.  It's a very low-quality CD, so I'm not sure you could stream it from your computer or iPod or iPhone or whatever.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for almost a year now and I still don't regret buying it.  I've gotten a lot of music for my car, but I've never purchased an auto-play CD.  There's no way I can listen to an entire album while driving, so this is the only choice I've made so far.

Amazon review: Where did all the powerful and emotion filled lyrics go? While the music may have at least attempted to go back to "From Here To Infirmary" it's stopped dead by Skiba's voice and lyrics, such as on "Draculina" and "The American Scream". His raw passionate words have turned into this terrible attempt at clean vocals and now songs just seem awkward when he decides to throw the "F" word into them ("Eating Me Alive").  Dan manages to save some of the album with "Off The Map" and "Fine," but once again, they lyrics are sub par.

Mumford and sons are dead.  They should have changed their band name with this album.  Disgusted.  This is sissy music horse s*.

Amazon review: I don't understand why people are so afraid of the word "Raunchy."  It's not the word itself, it's the thought behind it.  People are afraid to be "Raunchy" because they don't want to be called "Raunchy" and that's what you become when you put it into action.  I don't think you can be "Raunchy," you need to find your own style.  The last thing you need is to be labeled, you need to be able to stand on your own without having to be told.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I have a problem with the cover.  I thought that the cover was a great cover, but it is not. There is no way to open the case.  The only way to open the case is by pulling the little tab on the back.  The only other way is to unpack the CD itself and then open the case.  The inside of the case is nothing but a plastic tray with a cardboard cover.  So why is the cover on there?  I just don't understand.  I'm glad I ordered this album!  I love all of the songs on this album.  I just wish that they had left better reviews so people could get a better idea of what they were getting.  The only negative thing I could say is that the CD is small and I have had problems trying to play it.  It took me forever to figure out how to play it.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album.  I don't know how many people will like it.  I don't really like a lot of the songs, but I do like Trust in You and Empty Me.  I don't really like the "song" of empty me.  I feel like the song of empty me is just a little too generic.  It seems like a lot of songs are about people feeling empty and this song just sounds like it might be the same.  I guess I'll probably like this album when I hear the other songs on it.  As it stands, it is a pretty good album.

Amazon review: This is what happens when you put songs from the most popular musical artists into a CD with a bunch of boring songs from other artists.

I wish there were songs from other artists.  I would have much rather listened to a CD with songs from the other artists.  Maybe this album would have been better if there were less songs that had the same type of music.  I really don't know what the problem is with this album.  I like the songs on it, but they don't really stand out.  I like the songs on the album but there is just not enough variety in the album.  I don't know what the problem is with this album, but I don't really care

I feel like the CD itself is just boring.  I just wish it was a little more interesting.  I don't know what the problem is with this album.  It is pretty bad.  I just wish the CD had more songs on it.  I don't know why people would want to listen to this.  I don't know why people would pay money for this album.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

Amazon review: It's either badly done or just a really bad idea. Elvis' voice sounds rough.  I don't recall thinking that when I heard his original recording.  It makes his pairing with the orchestra a bad match.  It takes away from his greatness rather than enhancing it.  I won't be buying any more of the songs from this album.  I have been an Elvis fan since the first time I heard Don't Be Cruel and Hound Dog played on my radio over 50 years ago.  Re-release more mixes of his originals if you must, Priscilla, but please don't do anything like this "If I Can Dream" album again and no duets either.

Every song on one is on the other in the exact order. and I bought both thinking they'd be different.  Really disappointed that I bought the same CD twice with separate TITLES.  Great performer. probably a decent guy.  But let's take one of those off the market!  It makes this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or "sneaky".

Amazon review: T.C. Ellis had a brief part in Prince's "Graffiti Bridge" (the album and the movie).  His delivery was excellent, so I was truly looking forward to his solo debut. Unfortunately "True Confessions" fell short of the mark.  The first single "Miss Thang" was good.  Good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle (anyone else remember cassette singles?)  The rest of the album was mediocre.  T.C. Ellis had a fast-paced & flowing rapping style on "Graffiti Bridge" that was - lamentably - replaced with a slow & choppy style on most of "True Confessions".

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Amazon review: It's not the original version, but he gets close to it.  I had heard this song back in 1993 and was very moved by the lyrics. I inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it.  I finally was able to google it (2010) and found the exact song by Eddy Grant.  The song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color.  Great song and powerful message, a must listen for the cultural sensitive person.

Amazon review: It's great to hear an artist expand their horizons. I just wish Jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what I mean. Can't get in to this pop deluxe stuff. Some of the rave reviews puzzle me. This cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it. Not trying to say Jewel should stay confined but, just because record sales are "lagging" a bit, does that mean an artist has to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything Jewel seemed to want to tell us to rise above?

The video is a little overlong and there are a few errors in the editing but it's still a great video.

It's just so cute and so, so, so sexy and the video is just. well, it's just there. I was surprised that I loved "Good Time" so much that I have to love this song as well even though I don't know the first thing about it.  It's not that I don't know the words to this song, but I'm not sure how to explain it.  It's a good thing I like it, because it just. well, it's just there.  There's not much to write about it.

Amazon review: Okay, this effort is certainly more inspired than Victim of Love or 21 at 33.  But even though it's a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums, this recording still pales in comparison to Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road, Honky Chateau, Rock of the Westies, etc.  Many of the songs on The  Fox come frustratingly close to being classic EJ songs (Just Like Belgium,  Chloe, the title track).  But sadly the songs fall a bit short.  My advice?  Skip this one and purchase Jump Up, which isn't a great album, but is a  better example of Elton John returning to anything even close to his 70's  form.
