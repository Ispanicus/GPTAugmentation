Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This song is one I am not too familiar with and will no doubt learn as I listen to it more often.  In an effort to get it out the way, i will first say that this movie, "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly", was not a good movie.  The main character, "Sam Peckinpah" was an actor that was trying to do his best.  He did not have a lot of control over the film.  I will say that the movie was well written.  I really would like to see this movie remade with "Peckinpah" in it.  All in all it was not that bad.  I really don't like the way Sam Peckinpah was treated in this movie.  In the movie, he got shot.  He did not have to spend the rest of his life on a wheelchair.  He was only hurt by a bullet.  I think it is a shame that he had to quit acting as a result.  The movie was not without it's flaws.  For example, the main star, "Rock Hudson" (who was the other main star) had a relationship with his "girlfriend" "Beverly Garland".  In the movie, he cheated on her.  She was not happy with the outcome.  They got back together eventually.  This was probably the best movie I have ever seen.  Overall, the movie "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" was a great movie.  It was not a great movie.   I will say this about the movie; I was never interested in it.  I just saw it for the novelty factor.  I guess I was bored with my movie watching routine and wanted to see something new.  I will say this about the movie; I liked it.  I just didn't like it.  I would never see it again.   I will say this about the movie; It was not a good movie.  I will say this about the movie; I liked it.

I guess they are not as good as some of his other songs.  The songs on this CD are mostly from his songs that he wrote and sang with his wife.  This is a good CD for someone who likes Bob Johnson.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I bought this cds last spring, and I listened to it over and over for several weeks, listening to it at first and then after I was done with it.

Amazon review: This song is very good!  "Till Death Do Us Part" is a beautiful song that describes the relationship between a husband and wife.

The only thing that I don't like about this song is that you need to be able to sing along to the song with the same emotion.  You need to be able to feel each word that the singers say.

Amazon review:  This song is very long and very repetitive.  I would just like to sing along, but I am not sure how you are supposed to sing along.  I think it takes away from the feeling of the song.  Like the song says, "This is not the end.  This is just the beginning."

This is the story of the legendary singer/songwriter, Jewel.

Her father was an electrician and her mother was a school teacher. She grew up in California, and at age 11, she won a talent competition in the city by singing "It's hard out here for an old girl". Her music career started in the mid-90s, and she's been touring all over for the past 15 years. She's performed with various artists, but currently sings duets with her husband, Michael Bolton. She's a very talented singer and songwriter.

When I was a little girl, I loved listening to Jewel sing. When I saw her on the show, I knew she had crossed over and was now a pop-junk American Idol judge. But the real Jewel is a folk singer and a pop singer, too. She's one of the most talented and wonderful singers out there.

I have the CD in the car and I can't listen to it all day. It's just too beautiful. I would love to hear it again and again. And I would love to see her do another concert. I'll tell my friends. She is a true artist.

This song was amazing. I can't wait to see her again. Jewel, I know you are in pain, but you have a way of making me feel better. I hope you can sing again soon.

I can't believe that it was almost 2 years ago that we first met Jewel. I was driving down the street and I saw her standing by the side of the road and I was in tears.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  A must have for all the Broadway lovers out there.  I can honestly say, I have never been more excited to see a Broadway show than I was seeing this show.  I have seen many Broadway shows, but nothing like this.  It was the best, most enjoyable experience I have had at the theater.  The performances were fantastic, the music was great, and the set design was gorgeous.  I love seeing Broadway shows with a live orchestra, and this was a great example of it.  I had a hard time deciding which side of the orchestra, if any, to stand on during the performance.  I stand on the left side during the opening number, but I get the impression that the rest of the audience is on the right side.  The music was great, but I just could not stand the singing.  I had to turn the volume down on my computer speakers until I could hear the vocals.  I also thought that the lyrics were pretty bad.  Most of them just sounded like a bunch of people yelling "LMAO".  I do enjoy the music, but it just seemed like the songs were missing the emotion I feel when I watch the show.  I am sure this was the intention, but its just a shame that the songs were written like that.   I am not sure if I will ever buy another Broadway album, but if I do, this one is definitely at the top of my list.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I saw this show in London.  I was a little concerned when I saw the reviews that there were a lot of negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how many positive reviews there were.  The show was fantastic and I can't wait to see it again, hopefully it will be in a different country.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this show.  I heard that the show has been translated into Japanese, which I think was a great idea.  The show was a little longer than I thought it would be, but I think the length was perfect.  The characters did not seem to move too quickly, however, I would recommend that people who are a bit slower paced than me see this because I definitely felt like I was moving along.  In the end, I feel the show was a little overrated, but I am willing to give it a chance.  I am just not sure I will be able to live up to all the hype that has been made.  I will just be glad that I got this review.  I will be sure to let everyone know how I feel about the show.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was first introduced to this band when I saw their song on MTV in '97.  I bought the cd the next day.  I have no idea what the hell kind of people put these albums out.  If the record company would just play their music, they would be on the cover of Rolling Stone.  I know I shouldn't say that because they are just as bad as I thought they were, but I could list them in the alphabetical order of their albums and make a playlist for my cat to listen to, and I would.  I hate it when people say negative things about a band in the reviews, because it makes me feel like they don't know what they are talking about.  I don't know what else to write about this album.  I love it and I hate it.  I could write about how it goes from cheesy to cheesy.  I could talk about how the vocals are the same as the lyrics.  I could write about the fact that it sounds better in the car than in the bedroom.  But I don't.  For some reason I just don't like this band.  I don't know if it's the fact that I can't stand them or if it's the fact that I think they are so stupid that I can't think of anything good to say about them.  I don't know, it's just something I don't like.  But you don't get anything from this, so why bother?  I'm not going to listen to it again.  It's over.  I'm done.  This album is over.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I don't care.  I've made my decision.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I'm not gonna lie here. There are some great songs on this album. I get a good laugh out of the ones that are very cheesy, and it's not that bad when you let it slip into your head. The one thing I don't like about it is that it's a lot of filler. Some of the songs do not belong on here at all. Some of the songs are good, but the rest of the album is not good. I think this should have been 1 disc, or at least a double disc, because there are some great songs the way it is now. I do think it would have been better to release the whole album, and include the songs with the cheesy ones.

Amazon review: If you are going to write a tune that is truly about life and the blues, then I guess it is all over.  The song is a perfect example of how not to write a song, but Bob Johnson never should have been allowed to write a song in the first place.  If this song could have been about anything, I would have found it more interesting, but the song is not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you can’t find a better song than this, then I would suggest you buy it.  I am sure that most young blues people buy Bob Johnson’s music because they are not allowed to listen to anything else.  But with a little knowledge, like I learned from Bob Johnson (and I know he was only one man, and not a legend), you can learn what to listen for.  And that is the difference between the average blues fan and Bob Johnson.  I am a blues fan, and I think I am actually a better one than the average blues fan.  Because I know what I am looking for and I have the patience to listen.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first blues song I ever heard.  It is not the best song Bob Johnson ever wrote, but it is not a bad blues song either.  I think it is a great song.  And it is the only song Bob Johnson ever wrote to be the best song ever.  But Bob Johnson did not know how to write a song.  And that is what is so tragic about Bob Johnson’s songs.  He could sing and play the guitar, but he did not know how to write a song.  How can you be a good songwriter, when you can’t even write a song?  I don’t think he ever expected any of his songs to become hits.  And so, by the time he was good enough to write a song, he was past his prime.  I have a feeling that Bob Johnson probably never wrote another song after his “Blues”.  And I think his life was better off in his old age.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not a bad blues song.  The only problem is that it is so short.  And Bob Johnson's voice is not very good.  It sounds like he is only half way through the word.  But it seems like Bob Johnson's voice was always going to be short.  And he could not sing it all, so he had to leave out most of the words.  And that is why it is so short.  I would like to hear more of Bob Johnson's songs.  He did have a gift however, and that is what makes him a legend.
