Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

I love it that she was able to take a song and make it sound a little different. I loved it that it was a radio friendly mix of pop, jazz, rock and blues. I loved it that she used a harmonica in a song, and that she sang a song about a man who died and that he was a good man.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD 4 times and I love it. If I ever find myself in the mood to listen to great music, I will listen to this CD.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a big fan of this New York singer/songwriter who is also known for his work with the L.A. band the Dap Kings. I have yet to find a recording or performance of his I have liked (even the one he performed with the Dap Kings in the opening of the 2008 South By South West Festival was not exactly what I had hoped for) but this, a live performance of a song from his 2006 album of the same title, is great. I would recommend this to anyone who likes good rock and roll and who appreciates his song writing (which is great).

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: This album is a great example of a band that has put out a lot of music in the last two years or so and while some may disagree with some of the songs, they all have their charm.  I do not think I would have gotten this album without the support of the band and their fans.  "The Beginning" is the standout track and it was a nice surprise to find a song that does not have a strong "rock" sound but has a strong "pop" sound.  The song has a few different styles which can be heard on the song and the band is good at mixing the styles together.  "Anchor" and "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out" are the next two standouts that have great melodies and catchy lyrics.  The vocals are strong on these two songs and there are some very strong guitar solos on the songs.  "Sleeping at the Wheel" on the other hand, the vocals are not as strong as "The Beginning" and the guitar sounds a little too soft.  This is the only song I could not get out of my head and I do not know why.  It has a very catchy melody, but it is not as catchy as the other songs.  "The Ending" has a great melody and has the band playing a couple of nice guitar solos.  "Spin" is by far the strongest song on the album and it has a great melody and a chorus to die for.  The chorus is very catchy and the bass on the song is very strong.  "On and On" is a nice melody, but the vocals are very weak on the song.  "Take Me Away" is a beautiful and smooth song that has a very nice melody and the vocals are strong.  This one is what I would have gotten without the support of the band and their fans.  The album does not have a strong "rock" sound, but has a strong "pop" sound which is what I would have gotten without the support of the band and their fan base.

Amazon review: The music is great but the video, no. The camera angles are not always accurate. When you look at the faces, there are no smiles or laughter. The music is great, but the video is one of the best in the show.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I bought a CD of some songs by The Beatles (I've had many of their CD's) just to see if they sound good. The CD was nice quality, but the music was not very good. I wanted to buy the CD anyway--it was just a waste of money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: I bought this CD. I was expecting a lot of old songs and this is definitely not what I got. It is a collection of songs from a time and place, which is what I like.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon reviewer: I bought the album. I'm a big fan of Queen, and I love the album. I'm not sure if I'll listen to the whole thing, but I know I'll enjoy it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon reviewer: I bought this CD a few days ago. It was a great buy. I was expecting a lot of songs from the 60s and 70s, to a lesser extent, songs from the 1980s, but it was a nice mix. I'll probably buy every CD they make.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: I bought it as a gift. I just like the songs, not the album. I purchased the album and will listen to it when I want to, but I don't care to listen to this one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: I bought a CD of the song "In the Air Tonight" and it was nice, but not as good as I expected. It's like buying an album of songs that are in the same key and tempo as the song, which is a better way to listen to music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: They have several versions of the CD with different mixes of the songs, all in the same order. Some have different lyrics. The songs are all mixed by the same person. I think they should put an additional CD with other tracks that I might be interested in.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: I own a collection of CDs and bought this CD and I like it. It is a nice collection of songs. But I also know the songs I like by heart and I can't remember them all, that's why I bought this CD.

Amazon reviewer: I don't like "Eruption" but I'm a big fan of Queen. It was a great buy. It's a little disappointing that the band is selling CDs to the public.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: I bought an album of the Beatles. It was a great buy. The album was very well put together, the songs were all very well done, and it was like going to a concert. I did buy a few of the other songs, but I bought all of the "Eruption" CD to get the song "The Lion Sleeps Tonight". I just got it and it is amazing. I don't think I'll buy it again though, because I want to listen to the other songs. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: I bought The Beatles "The White Album". I listened to it several times. I don't know why but for some reason, I don't like the songs. I don't know if it is the music or the lyrics. I don't know what it is.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon reviewer: I bought "The White Album". I was looking forward to it. I loved all the songs. So I decided to buy it. I love the Beatles. I think the songs are great. I like all of the songs. I just don't like "The White Album" as much as I thought I would. It sounds like it was recorded in a different time and place. I don't know why, but I don't like it like I thought I would.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon reviewer: Queen - The Greatest Hits - I bought this album recently. It sounds great! Loved the songs. Love the music. Love the band. Love this album. I'm glad I was able to buy this as it was the best album I've ever bought. I was very disappointed when it was over. I really liked the songs.
