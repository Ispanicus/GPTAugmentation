Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.

A collection of songs from different artists from the 90's

A collection of songs from different artists from the 90's.

The lyrics are interesting, the music is great, and the video is hilarious.

My favorite: "Achy Breaky Heart" by Mariah Carey

The song is so catchy and I love that Christina Aguilera would throw in the word "chick" in the middle of the song

The song is just so catchy and I love that Christina Aguilera would throw in the words "chick" and "cock" in the middle of the song.

My least favorite: "My Last Night" by Christina Aguilera

This is the only song I really hate on the album, it's just so annoying, but I don't know why, it's just a stupid song.

"My Last Night" was really annoying, it was like a little kid would tell you to go to bed at midnight and then sing a song about how he/she wants to get into your pants.

I thought the album itself was a little boring, but I felt that when I was listening to the songs I really like, it was like I was in a movie.

"I Don't Want to Know" by Christina Aguilera

"I Don't Want to Know" was really good for the most part. It's just annoying when Christina Aguilera says such crazy lines like "You make me feel like a young man/You make me feel strong"

"I Don't Want to Know" is just a song about her being a young girl/young woman, but I don't think that she really means something by it.

"I Wanna Dance" by Christina Aguilera

"I Wanna Dance" was interesting because I really love that song. It's so catchy.

"I Wanna Dance" is about her wanting to dance with a guy, but I don't like the song because it's just a stupid dance song.

"I Don't Want to Know" by Christina Aguilersa

"I Don't Want to Know" is a song that is just really stupid. Christina Aguilera is just singing about how she doesn't know who she is and that she's confused.

"That's the Way Love Goes" by Christina Aguilera

"That's the Way Love Goes" is just a song about how it's time to break up with someone.

"I Wanna Dance" by Christina Aguilera is just a song about how much she loves to dance.

"We Don't Talk Anymore" by Christina Aguilera

"We Don't Talk Anymore" is just a dumb song that doesn't really say anything.

"I Wanna Dance" by Christina Aguilera was just a really good one, but I don't like the song because it's just a stupid song that is a little repetitive.

"The Best Day" by Christina Aguilera

"The Best Day" is just a song about how she's having the best day ever.

"I Wanna Dance" by Christina Aguilera and The Latin Divas is just a really good song and I really love that song, but it's just a little cheesy.

"I Can't Help Myself" by Christina Aguilera

"I Can't Help Myself" is just a stupid song because Christina Aguilera is singing about how she can't help falling in love with someone.

"You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman" by Christina Aguilera

"You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman" is just a stupid song that doesn't really say anything.

"I Wanna Ride" by Christina Aguilera

"I Wanna Ride" is just a song about how she feels like riding a bike.

"I Wanna Ride" by Christina Aguilera and The Latin Divas is just a very good song but it's just a little bit repetitive.

"Can't Help Myself" by Christina Aguilera is just a really stupid song about how she can't help falling in love with someone.

The album was average. I really liked "I Don't Want to Know" and "I Wanna Dance." I really liked "That's the Way Love Goes." I really liked "We Don't Talk Anymore." I really

I'm on the same page as everyone else here and I enjoy all the music I've listened to on this site. I've been listening to this site since it first started. I especially enjoy the "Best of the Best" selection. This is the first time I've voted for a song and I'm very happy I did. It's just an awesome selection of songs. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go read the music review.

It's a very nice compilation with some good music, but it really doesn't stand out from the rest of the music on here. The only thing that will really help it stand out is if it were on a better station and someone would play it. I don't really like this song. There are too many annoying pop songs in the same genre. I don't mind listening to pop music as long as the song is memorable. I'll vote for this song as a favorite but I won't be spending my money on it.

This song is great. It's got some nice sound effects and I love the melody. It's the first song on the Best of the Best that I've actually listened to more than once.

Amazon review: If you are a big fan of Trivium's style on their first two CD's, then don't even bother with this album. Not too long before this CD came out, Trivium covered Metallica's "Master of Puppets." In all honesty, the song rocks! But it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave Trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of Metallica. This new album is a complete letdown. Trivium has such an awesome sound on "Ascendancy," and for them  to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dreams of playing in Metallica is, frankly, depressing.

Amazon review: This CD is a classic. Not only are they playing in a style that they have been doing since their inception, they are playing in a style that I feel they have not yet achieved. There is nothing about this CD that is out of place, and it is the best Metallica sound I have ever heard. Their vocals are in the same range as their first CD and just as powerful. The guitar at times is almost as aggressive as on the first CD. I'm not a fan of "Hardwired," but this is a great album. This CD is awesome.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Metallica since the early 80's and this is the first Metallica album I have owned. I was a little disappointed in the album. I really wanted to like this album. I'm not sure where it went wrong. I still have "The Black Album" and "And Justice for All" but this one is not up to par. The guitar work is not as good as "The Black Album" and the music does not seem as good. I would say it is a good album and I hope to hear them again.

Amazon review: I was an early Metallica/ Megadeth fan. I fell in love with the band in my early teens and was instantly drawn to the band's music. This is my all time favorite album. I really liked the album and the band. I was surprised by the album because I was not expecting to have any negative reviews, but after listening to this album I just wasn't happy with it. The songs are amazing but there is an inconsistency with the lyrics and the production. I would give this album a 4 out of 10 for the music, but for the production I would say a 7 out of 10.

Amazon review: This is one of my favs from A BOY NAMED GOO, the CD best known for The Goo Goo Dolls' breakthrough hit "Name".  This mp3 version of "Flat Top" sounds horrible - it sounds like some of the downloads my sister's friend used to get from LimeWire, where there was this hissing that sounded like someone was running a drum stick along the cymbals.  I've owned this on CD several times b/c I have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad songs on ABNG, and I'm not always in the mood for the downbeat "Long Way Down" (trk1).

Amazon review: His commentary around the song on this version of Live at Massey Hall was sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch.

It was kind, and touching, and the song itself was great. Look for another year at Massey Hall, I am!

Amazon review: I buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different pictures of the eight Doctors. They should have name it Dr. Who and Daleks Calendar. Almost all the pictures are from the Peter crushing movie or comic book-like pictures. There is only one of Tom Baker and one of John Petwee. This calendar should be only for major Dr. Who and Dalek fans.

Amazon review: I agree with the two other reviews saying Stills is tired here.  Nothing is inspiring here and Stills looks like he is going thru the motions.  His guitar solos are good, however  his voice sounds weak (due to age I guess) and I was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band.  I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album and bought it for my birthday. I am not a huge fan of Stills but I do love Stills and this album. I think this was the best album of the year. This is a must for any Stills fan!

Amazon review: I like the album but for me this is not the best Stills album. I like it but I think it is a little on the soft side. I would rather not have this album at all. I think there is too much filler in this album. It should be all about Stills and his songs.  I would prefer a Stills and Nash album with the rest of the band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to say that I love Stills.  I think this is his best album yet. The only complaints I have is the songs on the CD.  I would like more Stills songs in the future than this one.  I would rather have Stills on with his band than Stills and his band.  I would rather have Stills and his band on there than Stills and his band and his band.  I would much rather have Stills solo with his band than Stills solo and his band.  The songs on this CD are great and I love the fact that its Stills and his band.  I love the fact that he recorded it himself and produced himself.  I like the fact that he also co-wrote the songs.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my wife to listen to in the car.  She had never heard Stills before so I figured this was a good chance for her to get to know him a little bit.  I had to say that I was very disappointed.  The songs are great.  The lyrics are great.  The sound quality is great.  The songs are a little short.  The guitar solos are a little weak.  The songs don't flow well together.  This is a great album and I am glad I bought it for my wife to listen to in the car.

I have to say that I am very happy with this CD.  This is a great album and I think that if I had listened to it before I would have liked it more.  However, after it was purchased I listened to it and I loved it.  I would say that if you are not a Stills fan this is not the album for you.  You will probably hate it.  I would say that Stills fans will like it.  I bought this CD because I am a Stills fan and I wanted to give my little girl a chance to hear him.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times and I like it very much.  The songs are full of energy and I think that Stills always makes great lyrics.

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

Amazon review: This makes no sense. Note to God is not an original song from Charice. The song is from JoJo's album The Highroad that came out in 2006.

Amazon review: This is the last of the "All Star" album songs. The first two songs are all about the band's time at the studio. "Crazy Diamond" is about having fun and being on top of the world with the band. "All Star" is about their time at the studio where they made the album that sold the most albums. The song "Let Me Be the One" is about how the band was at all times focused on the band first and their fans second. It's a great song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a very strange song.  It is the first track on the "All Star" album and it is about a girl who is going out with a guy who doesn't think she is good enough for him.  The song is all about how the girl feels.  The song has a great refrain and the chorus is very catchy, but it is not a very good song.  The song has a great chorus and great lyrics, but the songwriting is just not there.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first album by this band.  This album is known as the "All In" album because the first song on the album, "All In", is about a band who is on top of the world.  This album was a huge hit and sold the most albums. This song is one of the most popular songs on the album.

Amazon review: Tennessee-born Chester Burton Atkins (6/20/24 - 6/30/01) was co-creator with Owen Bradley of the Nashville Sound. He produced records for Elvis, the Everly Brothers and so many others, but Chet's true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing. This pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen Grammys and was Instrumentalist of the Year nine times. He's a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music and Musicians Halls of Fame.  RCA VICTOR's 1964 LP entitled THE BEST OF CHET ATKINS was issued in both mono (LPM 2887) and simulated stereo (LSP-2887e).

Amazon review: There are really only a few things in life we can count on. One is that we will die. Another is that Motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding, heavy, jam filled album and once again, they do not disappoint at all. Mikkey Dee sounds amazing and purely flawless on the drums while Campbell plays his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solos. Despite all the health problems Lemmy has had this year, he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry, heavy snarling vocal performance.

Amazon review: Nothing new here, except the packaging. This collection is the first time inclusion of "singles" from their recent lackluster album "That's Why God Made The Radio". The reason I highlight "singles" is because, what the heck is a single these days? Although there was actually a 45 rpm 7" vinyl "single" issued of "That's Why God Made The Radio", it was just issued only for, probably, collectors like me. The other new "single", "Isn't It Time", only exists on the album.

Our tour guide told us that he liked Tumbling Tumbleweed so much that he would have the band in the grand dining room play this song, Tumbling Tumbleweed, over and over! -

Amazon review: I purchased this CD for my wife.  She has some pretty good taste and likes country music.  I think this CD is pretty good, but can definitely hear other people's opinions.  I did notice that the song "The Wild Side" from the CD is not listed on the MP3 download.  It was not on the "one more try" link.  I don't know if the artist is trying to make a profit with the mp3 download.  I have no problem with that.  The song "The Wild Side" is a pretty good song, but I wasn't sure if it would be right for my wife.  I'll give her a listen and see what she thinks.  She is a country music lover and I like to listen to country music myself.  I hope she likes it.

Amazon review: This is a good song, but I wasn't sure if it fit my wife's taste.  She likes country music and I listen to it too.  This is a good country song though.  It would be a good one to add to a collection of your wife's CDs.  I hope you like it and I hope she likes it too.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

1. This download is labeled: "Comes with a free PDF of the sheet music for this song".  Its not free, its not marked free, its labeled "comes with."  I am not a music snob, but its kind of ridiculous to have a free download of sheet music for something if it isnt clear what it is.  Why is there even a PDF attached to it?  I guess its the same reason that I have to wait for it to download.
2. I clicked "Proceed to the next page" and then "Download this song".  It took me to a webpage that said "downloading file..." then the page went blank.
3. I clicked "Proceed to the next page" and then "Open in new window".  It opens up in a new tab, then closes and opens up in a new tab.  It then goes back to where I was.  Then it will go back to the page where it was.
4. The music is not in mp3 format.  Its in wav format.  I have no idea how it gets to be in wav format.  I have no idea what format it actually is in.  I have no idea what the file extension is, but I know it is not MP3.
I have no idea why this is listed as a free download.  I have no idea why it was not marked as free.  I have no idea why I am supposed to have to wait for it to download.  I have no idea why its listed as a free download when it is clearly marked as paid.

I have no idea why a free PDF file attachment is listed with a download.  I have no idea how it got listed as free.  I have no idea why the song could be labeled "free download" when it clearly says "download free" and "free download."
I have no idea how I could be expected to just go ahead and download this song when I have absolutely no idea what it is or what it actually is in.  I have no idea why a PDF file attachment is listed when there is clearly a free download.  I would like to know why it is labeled free when there is clearly a download.  I would like to know if there is any way to delete this song from my mp3 player.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  It is clearly marked "free download" and yet its listed with a PDF file attachment.

Amazon review: This is what I have come to expect from this artist.  I have already listened to this song a couple of times and I don't think I will be purchasing this album.  It's just not my cup of tea.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that this artist does not impress me.  I am a huge fan of the new wave and this artist is more of the same.  It's really not that bad of a song, but it just not something I would enjoy in any way.  I would really hope that in the future the artist would have a little bit of taste or else I would have to purchase the entire album.  I like some of his other songs, but this one is just too much.

I am a huge fan of this artist.

Amazon review: This song is good.  I will probably listen to this song and the other songs on the album, but I will probably not purchase it.  It's just not my cup of tea.  I like some of the other songs, but I don't think it was worth the whole album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If this song is on your computer and you don't buy it, then don't buy it.  I don't care if it was a re-release or not.  It sounds nothing like the original.  I would just buy the original.  There are a lot of other great songs on the album.  I only listened to about twenty minutes of this song.  If you don't like it, then don't buy it.  If you want music that you can listen to all day long, then buy it.  You can't afford to buy a whole album of music that you don't play any time you aren't listening to it.  I have listened to music all throughout my life and I love music.  If you don't enjoy music, then you are probably the most boring person on the face of the earth.  I am sorry, but I just don't see why you would listen to music that you don't like.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song has been in my computer for some time now.  I just have to say that the first song on this song is not worth listening to.  There isn't any style to the music and I don't know why the artists want to go through all this trouble.  I just don't see the point in it.  I just don't understand why you would waste your time listening to something

Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

Amazon review: I wanted more of their debut album and got it.  Oh, of course it's not just rehash, but it's more of -and improvements on- their excellent sound, voice, beat, lyrics.  Loved it upon first listen.

Amazon review: I hate that anyone thinks this is Burl Ives. Listen to the other songs on this "album". Listen to the classic from the original animated How The Grinch Stole Christmas. The singer's name was Thurl Ravenscroft.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "The Grinch" is a really good, classic song.  I think the song is an original, but I think all Disney songs are original.  The melody is very unique and the lyrics are catchy.  The music is the best part.  The vocals are not as good as the other Disney songs.  It's a good song, but I don't think it is better than the other songs.  But that might just be because I'm tired.  I want to hear the other songs.

Amazon review: I think this is a very good song.  It is not the first Christmas song to use the word "frosty".  I always thought that was just a popular word since "greeting" is a word that people use to greet people.  I don't think it's a "frosty" word.  I think it is just as "frosty" as "greeting".  I think it's a good song.  I think it's a good Christmas song.  I think it is one of the best Christmas songs.  It's not a bad song.  It just doesn't rock my boat.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I listen to rock music for about four hours a day. I know that this song is not a "rock" song but it rocks my boat.  I've been singing it since I was about 6 years old.  I know how to sing it.  I just can't get into the music.  It's just not my cup of tea.  I know this is a "Christmas" song but it's not really a Christmas song.  I just don't think it's a Christmas song.  I have been using the word, "frosty", in my head for weeks and even months and it's not even close to the best word I can think of yet.  But I think it is close.  I love "frosty" as a slang word and I think it's a great song.  I just wish I could get into the music.

Amazon review: "The Little Drummer Boy" is a song that I used to play every year when I was a kid.  I would sing it at the top of my voice and try to make it as loud as I could.  I thought it was a very good song.  I still love it to this day.  I used to play it at the top of my voice when I was a kid and I thought it was great.  I was very happy when I found out that it was actually an original song.  I thought it was a great song, but I was a little surprised that it was one of the top songs on the list.

Amazon review: I wish I could give this 5 stars because I really do love the performances on this album. However, the audio quality is seriously lacking on this album. It's as if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone. It sounds really thin. That and the lack of a CD release and being stuck with a crappy MP3 format, I really can't give it more than 2 stars. This performance deserves a better treatment and a proper release.

Amazon review: ordered the wrong one but I listened it it too late to return for an exchange

Amazon review: Yes this album is great, but I have a few problems with it....first, I have been using this format on my iPhone for over a year now; the audio quality is very poor compared to the album CDs. Second, although the album contains numerous covers, there are no original songs on the album. This album would have been a better purchase if it had original songs instead of covers. Third, the music is very distracting in my car. I have a CD player, but listening to this at 40 mph in the car was very distracting, and made me crank up the volume. The songs were also very loud, and I had to turn the radio down in the car to make it more tolerable. Finally, the last track is a remix of 'Love On Top'. The remix is the worst part of this album, though I understand why they did it. It sounds like a badly mixed version of 'Move' by Beyonce, and the remix did nothing to improve the song. I have to say this album was a terrible purchasing decision, and I'm disappointed in the music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say I was very disappointed with this album in the first place. It's a little too loud. I don't know what they were thinking with this album, it just didn't sound right to me and is very irritating. The music is great, but the album itself is very disappointing.

Amazon review: My friends and I were talking about how Beyonce has never released an album of original material, and then we decided to buy the Beyoncé album instead!

Amazon review: For a while it seemed that Taylor Swift could do no wrong. Even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs, with each album outshining the last one. Swift would even prove her doubters who would claim that "third time is rarely the charm" false when she came up with her best-to-date album Speak Now, which, like Fearless, is laced with big-girl wisdom that anyone can nod his/her head to.

I can't even give a coherent explanation why at this point.  I made it through the first listen and was thankful that I only spent the money on the download.

Amazon review: And I say that SO loosely.  This song wasn't great the first time I heard it and it's still sugar-coated fluff.  I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.  First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: not impressed the tune the beat and the voices not good for me don't know what could of been better

###
Amazon review: I was all ears for that first listen.  They are all killer songs but I feel as if this one is a little too overproduced.  I mean, it's a great tune, I love Chris Brown, I just have to get past the overproduced beat.  What do you want me to say, I liked "P.O.D."  I liked "Let Me Love U"  I liked "With You"  I did not like this one at all.  It's a "let's get down" song and it's not my kind of music.  I don't mean to be negative, I just don't think it is my kind of music.  I think they could of had the "Let Me Love U" song better, but I still like them all. I don't know what to say about this one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon.com review: Chris Brown does not give you a smooth sound, he gives you a punch in the mouth feeling.  His voice is so distinctive and intense.  This is one of those songs that if you hear it once you will never listen to the original version.  I think the first version was so good because Chris Brown was a great singer and he had such a powerful voice.  This version does not match up with those song.  The beats are so overproduced, I don't think Chris Brown would ever write a song like this.  I am not trying to be negative.  I just don't really get this song.  It is more of "let's get down."  The lyrics are great but the music is so overproduced.  Chris Brown can still sing, just not with this song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon.com review: I don't know what to say.  This song gets boring after a while.  Chris Brown doesn't give you a smooth sound.  His voice is so distinctive and intense.  This is one the songs that if you hear it once, you will never re-listen to the original version.  I like the first version very much because Chris Brown was a great singer and he had such a powerful voice (He had the "P.O.D." song).  This version gets boring after awhile, it's not that bad, but it gets boring after awhile.  I don't know what to say about this song.  It can be very catchy at first, but after awhile it gets old.  Now, I like the original version of "P.O.D.", but I think Chris Brown does not give you a smooth sound.  His voice is so distinctive and intense and this song gets boring after awhile.  He can still sing, just not with this song.  The beats are so overproduced, I don't think he would ever write a song like this.  I don't mean to be negative, I just don't really get this song.  It's more like "let's get down."

Amazon.com review: My parents bought this CD for me when I was in 7th grade.  They wanted me to play it but I refused.  I think that Chris Brown is a great singer.  I thought that his version of "P.O.D." was really good.  That's why I thought that this song was over produced.  I don't think Chris Brown would ever write a song like that.  He is a great singer but a little too overproduced.  I like "P.O.D."  This is a great song.  I don't know how they got this song down.  Chris Brown does not give you a smooth sound.
