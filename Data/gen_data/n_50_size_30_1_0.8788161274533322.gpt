Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I know I should have listened to the CD before I put it in my CD player, but I don't have the cd in my computer where I can listen to it.  This is a very good CD, but I am sure I will not listen to it for a long time.  I would like to have the music that I listen to while driving.  I can't listen to it while driving, because it's too loud.

Amazon review: I have been playing Country Gospel Music all my life.  I cannot say enough good things about the songs on this album.  They are very inspirational.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD on a Friday night when I decided to get some new Country Gospel CD.  It came in yesterday. I do feel at times that I have to listen to it every time I drive to work.  It is a beautiful CD to listen to, but it is very repetititive.  I hope you continue to write great songs and produce great music.  If they ever come out with another CD, I will definitely buy it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I liked it, but didn't like it at all.  It is repetitive, and I can't get into it.  I have a CD player that I am pretty sure is not working properly, and I had to sit and listen to the CD for a while before I could listen to it.  The music in the CD sounded more like a "cassette player" than a "CD player" to me.  The music in the CD seemed more like "cassette tape" than actual CD.  This is a great CD, but I could only listen to it while driving.  I am glad I purchased it.

Amazon review: I had a CD of this artist, and I thought it was wonderful.  But after I listened to the entire CD, I was disappointed with it.  I was even more disappointed when I started playing it on my computer and the sound was so distorted that I could not hear at all.  I think it is a shame that a great music artist isn't getting more exposure in the world.  I would like to have another album by her by now.

I would recommend this album to a person that isn’t trying to be perfect and is trying to be a better person.  This CD is for people like that.  I would recommend this CD to a person that can listen to the lyrics and not just see the music

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:  I have a friend in high school who has been a huge fan of this band since she was in 6th grade.  She sent me a demo and I liked it so much I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy.  I was on the lookout for a cd by this band for a long time but could never find one.  The first time I heard the song "Goodbye" I was like "this is the song" and I've been listening to it on my MP3 player ever since.  I've been a fan of this band ever since that day.  They are great in every way.  They are one of the few bands that I've found on the mp3 players that I would just listen to all day and not have to get out of the car.  They are so great in every way they don't need to sing or perform to make their point.  They are just great in every way when they're not singing you can just sit and listen to them.  I've always enjoyed listening to them on my mp3 player and I just don't ever want to get rid of it.  I'll probably buy another CD from this band.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review:  I bought this album from the library, and it took me a couple of listens before I realized why I had gone out and bought it.  I had bought it once before with the intention of listening to it, but I think I was just too young or too busy.  I was pretty disappointed.  The band sounds great, but the songs are just all over the place, and the singers don't really sound anything like they did on the radio anymore.  I can't imagine singing a song from this album back in the day.  I was hoping to get a real feel for the band, but I think I did just the opposite.  I didn't understand what the heck the band was doing, and it sounded like the band had completely changed.                I was hoping for more, because there were a lot of great songs on here.              The only song I really liked was "Breakdown in Three/Four," but I don't think I'll be buying this album again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This album is full of great songs.  This album really should have been released as a single.  There are some great tunes here, but most of them have been completely revamped, and I feel like I am listening to a completely different album.  It is a shame, because they did a great job, and I just feel disappointed that they have changed so much.              I love everything about this album, but it just feels like they have changed a lot, and I don't like it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is one of the better releases in recent years, especially with the addition of a new song and the live versions of the songs from the second and third albums.  The band is in fine voice and there is some great energy here.  The arrangements are excellent, and the songs are well sung.  The album could use some more music on it, especially the live songs, but it is definitely a good listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This is a great album, and the fact that the band was willing to re-record their entire first album is a testament to their passion and creativity.  The only thing I don't feel is the absence of newer songs.  The band has a fine voice, but they just don't have enough of that great energy in the songs.  I think this album would be better if they had released an entire second album, though.

It just keeps getting better and better, and the songs are great.  I was really looking forward to this release because of the new songs.  I didn't think that they would re-record everything, honestly.  I think that they have a new sound that is coming out of them that is different from the old style of the band.  The old songs are just great songs.  The new songs are awesome, but I think that they should have released the entire first album.  I love the music, the lyrics, the band, and I wish that they would release the entire first album.  This album is fantastic.  I have already purchased the entire second album, and I am really looking forward to it.

I am very happy that I did it, because I was very happy to have them perform for me.  I was not disappointed at all.  I am very happy that I have one of the greatest bands, but I am also happy that I have a fantastic album.  I am really happy to have this album.  They are one of my favorite bands.  I would love to have them come to my country to record an album with me.  I would love to have them record

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: If you love opera, listen to this album. If you hate opera, listen to this album. This is not a bad album, its not a good album. I would have preferred if this album had been produced in a more traditional manner, with singers and orchestra, and maybe an extra instrument for some of the slower movements. This album leaves a lot to be desired. I'd be a lot more interested in hearing a live opera recording. I can't even remember the name of the opera I was listening to when this album was released, but I can tell you the name of the music: "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men" This is not the worst album, but not the best either, either. I was expecting a lot more from this album. This is the least interesting album I have heard in years. I like opera, but I really didn't come away from this album inspired to listen to another opera. I have already purchased the rest of the album, and it is really good. But I just think that in this post-modern world of ours, we don't need to go back to the days of opera. We have the internet, the greatest music player on earth, and a really easy way to share music with others. If you don't like it, don't buy it. I am a die-hard opera fan, but I love listening to music that is not opera. You have to be able to listen to opera and love it. This album is not that album. It's just not. It is just a little too traditional for my taste. I am not sure I want to hear more of this album. It is not bad, it's just not the best opera I have heard in a long time. I really wish I had listened to more of the other albums on this album instead of purchasing this one. I am just glad I bought the CD. I don't think it was a bad album, but I don't think I will be buying any more albums by this artist. If you love opera, listen to this album. If you hate opera... listen to this album.


Amazon review: I am a big fan of classical opera. I have been a fan of the music since the beginning of my life. It's been a large part of who I am since I was a little girl. I have listened to it since I was able to hear it, and I love it. It makes me happy. It makes me feel comforted after a long day of work. It makes me feel happy. It makes me feel like my life has purpose and meaning. I love to listen to music and opera is my favorite. I don't care if you like it or not, but I would like to hear a little more of it. I am a big fan of opera and have been for as long as I could remember. My favorite part is seeing the actors dressed in period costume and singing the words of the opera. I am not a fan of modern music, but I still love to listen to opera. I have done a lot of research on classical music, and I have found that the only music that can stand the test of time is classical music. I am not anti-modern music, but I am not a fan. I have been a fan of classical music for as long as I have been alive. I love to listen to it and appreciate it so much. I have also recently started listening to contemporary music, but classical music always comes first for me. I am not an opera lover, but I am an opera music fan.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

So many of you have been going on and on about the music. Its great. I got the songs I wanted, which I was really excited about, but the CD was only half the song I wanted. I am stuck. I was really looking forward to this CD. My daughter and I got tickets to see the show, and we were told it was a show we couldn't miss but we won't know until we get there if we can go or not. I was looking forward to the concert because of the way the songs were written, with the lyrics and stuff. I like to sing and sing a lot, but I was not looking forward to this concert. I hope I am wrong.

My daughter and I were really excited to see the show, but we were let down. I went to the concert, and it was a great show and I really expected to hear some really cool songs. I was disappointed that the songs that I wanted to hear didn't come out. The songs that are part of the program were good, but the songs that were not part of the program didn't really stand out. I think the songs that were part of the program were better than the songs that were not part of the program. The show was good, and I really liked the way the songs were written. But for me, I think I was let down. I don't believe that the songs that were not part of the program were better than the songs that were part of the program. I was disappointed because I really wanted to hear some of the songs that were written. When the concert was over, I walked out of the building and I left the theater with a bad taste in my mouth.

I thought that the concert was great, and I really liked the songs that were in the program. I went to the concert because my daughter and I were really excited to see the show. We were told that the concert was a "family-friendly" show, which I thought was a great idea. I thought that the show was going to be fun, exciting and a great time. The show was really good, but I was let down. I have to give the concert one star because I really expected something that would be a lot better than the show. But for me, it was really disappointing. I think that for all of you who went to see the concert, you were let down because you expected something that would be a lot better than the show.

I thought that the concert was great. I went to the show because my daughter and I were really excited to see the show. We also went to see the show with a group of friends because we love to sing and we wanted to hear some of the songs that were in the program. The concert was really good, but the show left me disappointed. I have to give the concert three stars because I really expected something that would be a lot better than the show and the show was disappointing.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: The best of the Eminem albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album for my girlfriend and she loved it, but I didn't care for it as much.  It's a good album, but it is just too predictable.  The best part of the album is "The Way I Am." It really is a beautiful song, and it is a perfect way to end any album. Also, the album is not only about lyrics, it's also a great album to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, and the best of the Eminem CD's.  I've tried to get my girlfriend to buy it, but she's a little scared of it.  She's afraid of it because she thinks it's going to contain some kind of curse or bad magic.  I don't know what she's afraid of, but I do know it's going to be worth it.

Amazon review: This is the best album he has made to date.  A lot of people said that he didn't have a good voice and that he was annoying, but they said that this album is the best Eminem album ever made.  All of his albums are good, but this album is great.  It is a perfect album for any Eminem fan.    This is definitely one of his best albums.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a very good album.  I would say Eminem's best.  It's a little more mature, and it contains a little more of the hip-hop side.    I don't think this is his best album, but I do think that this is his best album to date.  I would say that this is his best album of the past 15 years.  This is one of my favorite Eminem albums.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is by far the most underrated album Eminem has ever made.  If you like Eminem, then you will love this album.    If you don't, then leave it alone.  The album is good, but not great.  It's a little more relaxed, and it has a little more of a hip-hop feel.    I think this is one of his best albums, and probably his best album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very surprised to receive this as a gift. I thought it was a bad album and did not have a choice. It is very well-balanced and has a lot of positive aspects. The only negative thing I have to say is the fact that the only song on the album is called "Hymn to the Lord" which is a song without a true ending. However, it is just a song and I am not going to complain. If you want to hear a song without an ending, this is the album for you.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I ordered this as a gift for my daughter, just as a present. The album does not hold a candle to the original, but it is well-put together and well-sung. The only weakness in the album is that the only song is "Hymn To The Lord," of which the only true ending is the one with the "nag-a-bed" (naggers don't like it). It is a terrible song, and should not be listened to by anyone but those who know the Lord. However, the album is very well-done and can be heard by anyone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was told this was the best album of the year. I have listened to this album about 6 times already. I can not even begin to explain the things that I heard during my listening. The lyrics are very good and the music is outstanding. This is the most beautiful recording I have ever heard. The vocals are outstanding, and the orchestra is fantastic. I could listen to the orchestra all day. The guitar solo is a masterpiece. The only thing I would like to change, is that the end should be a little more dramatic.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am not a music person, and I am not a singer. But I did have a dream, and that dream was to sing a song by a great American, and I was lucky enough to hear it on the radio. So, I bought this album. I listen to it everyday and I love it. It is so beautiful. I listen to it while I am working, or I listen to it in the car on my way to work. It is just that good.

The only thing I wish is that it included "The King's Speech" and "Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer."

Amazon review: I was given this album as a gift, and I am so happy that I did. I love that it is a compilation of all the albums Lin Manuel Miranda has released since his debut.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: i have been a fan of the band for many many years, so at first it comes as a surprise when i find out that the lead singer is dating a stripper!  but then i realize they are just a bunch of normal guys who love music, and love to party.  i thought maybe they would have a bit of a bad reputation for being a bunch of loud, drunken idiots, but i discovered that they are actually very nice guys.  their music is very good and it is well played, with great energy, and great arrangements.  their songs are great!  they play their own music, but they also love to cover other songs.  this album is perfect for a concert.  you will definitely end up dancing!  they don't go out much anymore, but i guess they get off on their music.  they are also an alternative band, and they make you feel like you're in the punk rock era.  i love them!  also, it has been almost a year since they have been on tour.  i think it has a lot to do with the fact that they are constantly touring, and it is hard to put music out when you are on tour.  the only bad thing is that they have taken a step backwards since their first album.  if you like alternative music, you have to check this album out.  it is different, it is good, and there is a lot of it.  its just a shame that its not up to par with their previous albums.  it is definately worth trying, and i have to admit, i will buy it again!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  If you like music with a good beat and a danceable style, this is the album for you.  It has a good beat and good beats, but this album still lacks the intensity that you would expect from a band like this.  Thalia has several hits here, but many of these songs are just average.  This album has some really good songs, and you should definitely check it out.

Amazon review:  I really like this band.  I think that this album is a good one for a band that likes to put on a good show and get people dancing.  The album starts off with a cover of the Beatles song, and it is a fun start to the album.  A lot of the songs are pretty good.  After a couple of songs, the band goes into some really fun songs.  I think that the band is definitely a great live band.  They do not get off on being obnoxious.  They are not like other bands that play for the people.  This band is for the people.  They are good at what they do.  I think this is one of the better albums that this band has put out.  It is also probably one of the better albums that the band has put out.  This is one of those albums that you will be glad you bought.  I have been a fan of this band since I first heard them.  I always say that they have a good time doing what they do.  They play everything from Rock to Country to Pop.  They do a good job of playing their own songs.  They have a good sense of humor, and a sense of humour.  I think that this is a great album for people who like music.  It is not a lot of "hits."  It is mostly good songs.  This band has a lot of good songs.  It is not one of those albums that you just sit back and enjoy.  It is not one of those albums that you go and play a couple of songs and go back to the album.  This is an album that you will not want to put in the CD player.  The songs are really good.  The band is great and they have a good time doing what they do.  They play music that you can dance to.  This album is a good one for dancing.  Its not one of those albums that will make you sit out in the corner and laugh.  I think that this is a good album for people who like to party.  This band is one of the best bands that I have seen in a long time.  They are very entertaining.  I think that it is a good album for people who like to party.

Amazon review: I first heard this album when I was about 10 years old, I must have been listening to it constantly for that time.  It was the first album that I heard my dad play.  This album is really great!  I love the music and especially the way they use different instruments that I did not know about and so on.  The lyrics are great and I think they are about a boy who wants to play saxophone.  I have listened to this album many times, and it is never boring.  I really like it and I really like how I can really hear the different styles of music.  I wish I could get a cd version of it because I would like to make a cd with different musicians.  I also really like the way this album is laid out, and the way it is performed.  The album is very well made, and the music is well put together.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of 3 songs, a couple of good songs and 3 or 4 good songs.  Two of the songs are classics that have been covered, one of them being "Backwater" by the Ramones.  I only played "Backwater" twice and never understood why.  I understand that song is about the backwater of Texas, which is what the song is about and it's a different song, but it's not a song that fits into the Western genre.  "Jolene" is another song that didn't fit into the Western genre, and it's about a girl that wants to go to college, but she's broke.  The song is a good one, but it's not the type of song that should be in a Western album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the intro but the way they play the songs is a bit off, the drums sound more like they're doing a drum solo and not the actual song.  And the song "Love Me" is the worst song ever, it's a good song, but the lyrics are just horrible.  And I hate the "I've got the world on a string".  Those lyrics are just offensive.  And the song is called "Justify".  I don't understand what the song was trying to say.  And the song "All I can say" is good.  The song is called "All I can say" and the lyrics are about being in a relationship and being on a journey.  The song is really good.

The song is about being in a relationship, and not being in a relationship, and being on a journey, and then not being in a relationship, and being on a journey.  The last song is good, but the song is about the guy who wants to have a relationship with a girl that he just met, and he wants to do it without her.  The song is about the guy who wants to have a relationship with a girl he just met, and he wants to do it without her, and he doesn't want to do it while he's in a relationship, and he doesn't want to do it while he's in a marriage.
