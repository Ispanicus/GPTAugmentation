Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It turned out that Amazon is only selling this single CD version of the CD version (which is fine, if you were looking for a single CD). However, the actual performance CD is far superior. The only "dumbing down" that was done, was by leaving out the "Prestissimo" section (the aria). There are two other arias that are also omitted from this recording.

One thing, though:  When I tried to go back and listen to the CD, it wasn't on the menu that said "New Releases"---it said something like, "The most recent music from your favorite artists."  I thought that was the only way to get CD #1 but apparently not.

Amazon review: I was going to buy this album because it is a great album and it included my favorite song.

Amazon review: This is not a good album.  There are a few good tracks (the "Prestissimo" is the best of the album) and some nice songs on the album (the songs are nice, but they are not the best of the album).  But the rest of the album isn't good.

Amazon review:  I bought this record from Amazon, and I'm very impressed.  The album is great, and all the songs have a great message.  The only problem is that the "Prestissimo" section of the album is so bad that I can't listen to it, and I can't listen to the other good sections of the CD.  I will not buy this CD again.  I don't know why they put that song in the CD, it's so bad.  As a matter of fact, the CD is terrible; it's not that the singing is bad, it's that the music is very very bad.  I don't know if I'll buy another CD from Amazon.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

You could sing better.  But no, you chose to make an album called Twiztid.  That just doesn't make sense.  I hope this guy gets better and can make some good stuff again.

I have been trying to find the new album for a while, and I got to tell you, they have done a great job of making songs that will really hit the spot.  I hope they continue to make quality music.  I just hope they are able to find a label to help them.  It would be nice to see them live again.  I really want to see them, but I don't want to wait that long.  Any other fans of Ninjaman out there?  What did you guys think of the new record?

Amazon review: This is a really great album. I think if I were to give it to someone who was a regular listener to this kind of music, they would love it.  They would be able to appreciate the songwriting and the atmosphere it creates.  There is almost a sense of freedom in this album. It's like the bands have put aside their differences and come together to create a cohesive sound. And, I think I'm right.  The band isn't as good as some of my other favorites, but I still appreciate their music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this is a really great place to start for those who want to explore the world of jazz as a genre and not just a sound.  They also have a new album coming out in July and all the other albums on this list are also great.

###
Amazon review: This is probably the best jazz band in the world.  A lot of people will compare this to Miles Davis, but they have a completely different sound to them.  The other members are very versatile.  If you have a good ear for music and like to explore new music, I would definitely recommend you check this band out.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an amazing album.  I do find it a little boring but that's to be expected. I have only listened to about a third of it so far. I think the album has so much variety from the original recording to the new recording with a few songs having been replaced.  The new recording sounds great.  Overall, this is an awesome album. This is the best jazz album I have heard so far.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I thought that this album was a really good one. I love the way they incorporate classic jazz with a beat and a little modern jazz with a beat.  I think that it has a good mixture that fits in with the genre.  I give them a 7 out of 10.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is great.  I like that it has a lot of different music on it.  It's not a jazz album but a lot of different music.  The only thing that gets on me is when they go from acoustic to electric.  And by "they" I mean "The Manhattan Transfer."  I wish they would tone down the electric stuff.  I would like to listen to them without the electric stuff.  I give this album a 7 out of 10.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was my first time ever hearing "Maiden Voyage."  It was cool but I still liked the other albums that I had previously listened to.  This is a great album that I would recommend to others.  It's got a good variety to it.  I give this album a 7 out of 10.

Amazon review: This is an extremely good album.  If you like the jazz genre, then I highly suggest this album.  It's got jazz from the 50's through today in it.  It has a great variety of music.

What can I say? I'm an idiot.  I put this on the "top 10" and it was the number one hit in the country.  This is the first time I have ever put my music on the top 10.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This CD came as part of a package with a CD player and a CD player case.  I had no idea what to expect, and I didn't know if I would like the music on both of them.  I have to say, I was surprised!  My wife is the one who suggested the CD when we were having a discussion about what to do with the CD collection we were purchasing.  She said something about a CD collection being like a box of chocolates, and suggested that we get a CD player and a CD player case.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What I didn't like was that I could hear the CD player and CD player case in my room.  The CD player is about the size of a small suitcase.  They aren't cheap though.  There should be a CD player and a CD player case that are smaller.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Revel is an old school swing band with a lot of "tour de force" (totally different than this band).  They have a very laid back vibe that is very  refreshing to the genre.  The sax player is very good and the horns are not needed, which are the reasons I decided to try this band out.   
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I heard this CD a few days ago in the store near me. My wife and I are big fans of this band.  This is another great cd, well worth picking up for the price.  If you are looking for a good old rock and roll band, then this is the CD for you.  The band sounds tight and they all have great harmonies.  The sax player is great and he has a very nice tone.  I would rate Revel at around a 7.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The music on this cd is awesome!  I have no problem with the band.  I play in a band at church, so I know how good the music is.  It is just that I am not a fan of the sax player who is on this cd.  He's a great guy, and I love him because he has a very nice tone.  However, I cannot stand how he is always singing the same song over and over again.  I have known many great singers, but how many of them can sing the same song 20 times over?  It's not even a good song.  I could have played the song that way.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was a bit dissappointed by this cd.  I was looking for a good old west swing band but to be honest the band here is not what it could be.  The vocals sound pretty good considering it is from a gospel group.  My cd is collecting dust on my shelf.  I will not buy another cd from this band.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I agree with the negative review.  Revel is a great band but they are not the same as they used to be.  I love all their music but this is the one I will listen to when I am bored.  I have had better bands but this is the only one I can stand.  I have heard some great CDs at a lot less money and I would never recommend them.  This band is a good band but they are a little different.  The sax player is great but he is not the best and the horns are not needed.  The band is not the best but what they have is what I like about them.  I have heard a lot of great bands but I have only heard one that I can stand.  That's Revel, a good band that has some great music but they are not the bands they once were.  If you are looking for a good old time rock and roll band then buy this cd.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Ray Benson for years.  This is Ray's 4th cd and I have enjoyed every one.  The band has made a lot of changes over the years and I hope they will continue to do so.  I have heard some great bands at a lot less money and I would never recommend them.  This is a good cd but it is not a great cd.  I feel like a fool because I have the cd and I don't know how to play the cd.  I have no experience with this cd.  I have a cd of Ray Benson's of old and I am sure I could play this cd.  I don't have to know how to play it.  If you are looking for a good old time Rock and Roll band and are not looking for a good old time Rock and Roll band, then buy this cd.  This is a good cd.  The sax player is great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The band is a good old-time rock and roll band.  They play the music in a real way and they play it differently every time.  There is a slight change in the band every time they play and that's why I think it is a good band and I have fun with it.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a good album, but I do not like to listen to music that I do not feel in my body.  I have listened to the album a lot and I can't stand it. The songs are generic and not very good. He has to get real with the fans or he is going down.  The only good songs are "The Way" and "Til The End".  "The Way" is very good, the rest are average to bad.

Amazon review: This album was very nice, I listen to this music on the beach or walking around.  They have great songs, it is just very very boring.  He has to get more passionate, I feel he has to make some new songs like I have all the other albums.  These songs are nice, but not very good.  His voice is not that great and he is a very boring guy.  He should have put in more effort or he is going down.  The songs are very nice and the lyrics are not that bad, but I do not like the voice and the generic songs.  It is just very boring, I would not listen to this on a daily basis.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

These are all the Amazon reviews I found when Googling "Mama's Little Monster" - I've added several more that turned up as a result of a friend telling me about them.
I am very grateful to all of these reviewers for sharing their feelings about this album.
The song "The Good Wife" - the first song I found - is a great song, but it is not an album highlight.
"Mama's Little Monster" was a little disappointing.
"The Devil's Son" - I had heard of this song before, but I was not quite sure what to make of it.
"The Drowning Girl" - I had no idea what to make of this song.
"The Devil's Son (Part II)" - This is another song I had heard of before, but I had no idea what to make of it.
"The Drowning Girl (Part II)" - This is another song I had heard of before and I thought it was pretty good, but it was not the standout track on this album.
"The Drowning Girl (Part I)" - This is another song I had heard of before and I thought this was pretty good, but it was not the standout track on this album
"The Drowning Girl (Part III)" - This is another song I had heard of before and I thought the last song on the album was pretty good, but it was not the standout track on the album.
"The Drowning Girl (Part IV)" - This is another song I had heard of before and I thought that the second song on the album was pretty good, but it was not the standout song on the album.
"The Drowning Girl (Part V)" - This is another song I had heard of before, but I thought it was pretty good, but it was not the standout song on the album
"The Drowning Girl (Part VI)" - This is another song I had heard of before, but I didn't think it was that good, but it was not the standout song on the album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: What can I say! The first time I heard this album, I was blown away!  The first song I listened to was "Saints of Judas" and I thought it was one of the best songs ever played on radio.  The second time I heard it, I was blown away by the album.  The third time, I was blown away by the album again.  The third time I heard the album, I thought it was one of the best works ever created by any band.  This album is a masterpiece.  Not only is it one of the best albums of the 90's, it is in my opinion, one of the best albums of all time.

Amazon review: Well, I've seen a lot of people complain about the lyrics. Personally, I love them.  I know that there are people out there that just don't get it because they are too sensitive.

I'm not one of those people and I'm glad I can get lyrics that are honest and make me think.

Amazon review: I loved this song on the show "The Good Wife". It was an empowering song and it really fit the theme of the movie. Its sad that so many people are leaving the show. I think it is horrible that they are trying to make a show that is like a "reality show". When I first heard the song it was really depressing and I really just wanted to vomit.

Amazon review: I love the song "Hollywood Squares", and I love your voice. I think your voice sounds like a cross between Patti Smith, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Go-Go's. I think you have a really clean sound. I think it would be a good idea to do a real performance of "Hollywood Squares" during the scene where they are playing the game and you sing it. I know it is a little cheesy, but it would be really cool and it would make the scene. I would be the only person in the audience who would know you were singing it, but I hope that you would be able to pull it off. I think it would be a very cool performance. I would love to see you do it.

That's the only thing I don't like.  I don't know why he was added to this album because the song "I'm Ready" is not bad, but he can't sing it and it has that same rap / singing voice that is just annoying.  Maybe if they had a more original singer and not a rapper it would have been better.  Overall I like this album.

I don't like the fact that "All the Way" was left out of the album because it's not that good.  The rest of the songs are okay but I don't like them.  I want a better rapper and a higher energy rapper instead of this rapper.  I don't know why he was added to the album but he is not doing anything good.  He can't sing and he has that "Madrox" voice.  The next song after "All the Way" is a really good song.  I like it.  I don't know why they didn't finish this album.  It's not that bad.  I know people have the same complaints about this album but I like this album.

The songs "I'm Ready" and "All the Way" are both good songs on the album that I like.  The rest of the songs are not that great, but they are good.  I like the song "Bustin".  I don't know why "All the Way" was left out of the album and it's not that bad.  If they had a better rapper it would have been better.  The beats were good on this album.  The guitar on some of the songs was hard to hear but I didn't have any issues with the guitar on this album.  The best thing about this album is the music.  The lyrics were average on this album.  I don't know why they didn't finish this album though.  It's not that bad.  I'm glad I bought this album.

I don't know if they are trying to be a "new" band, or if it is just an interesting change. I don't see the point in another name change, because they should stick with the name.
