Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This album was a great way to get into Danzig, but after I listened to it, I've still not been able to find it anywhere. I'm guessing it is on Amazon's CD racks, but I can't find it anywhere either. So please, please, please get it on the market.

Amazon review: I would not recommend this album to anyone. I was hoping it would be like the old "Let's Dance" where it was the soundtrack for every party it was played before. This was in fact, the soundtrack for every party I ever attended at a friend's house. I didn't have the volume turned up for fear of hearing the neighbor's dogs barking in the background and I don't think I've heard a single song from this album since. It is not a party record. It is a bad, terrible, and mediocre CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Danzig has always been a great singer, but this album is not his best. His voice is not as strong as on his earlier albums. He is also not as focused on the lyrics. This album is a good one, but one can't help but compare him to Black Sabbath, and in my opinion Black Sabbath is better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Danzig is the only artist in my opinion who can make a real rock 'n roll album. He has always had a way to connect with his audience, but after hearing this album first thing I did was turn the radio way up. It would have been nice to hear something other than Danzig and a few other artists who had to sell out for their music to be heard.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very disappointing album. I was looking for something of quality and not just a good time. I am a big fan of black metal, so I thought I would give this a try. I was expecting something like "Thrall" or some other album with high quality and well written songs. This album is nothing but filler. I am still listening to it, and I don't think it will be on my CD player much longer. I wish they would have released this on cassette, or some other form.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have only heard this on the radio twice and this is why my CDs are not selling. I am not a fan of Danzig, but I am really tired of hearing this garbage. I would never buy this, but if I was a fan of black metal I would have no problem buying this. This is a complete waste of time. I would not recommend this to anyone. I am glad to hear the CD is on the market. I want to know what really happens to these cd's.

Amazon review: I don't think this album is worth your money or your time. It is more about making the listener feel sorry for you than it is about making them think or feel. You can't really tell what the lyrics mean by listening to them, but they sound like they were written by a twelve year old. The music, the voice and the guitar tone is good but the vocals are not. The lyrics are not any better. It is a real shame, because I really wanted to like this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album. I have been collecting Danzig albums ever since I got my first album by him and I have been extremely disappointed with the rest. I bought the one on the radio that was on the radio playing when I was in my car driving and it was a great album. I have not been able to find any on the internet anywhere nor does the radio channel that I was listening to play it anymore. This is the first album I have purchased and I have to say I am glad I did. It is a great album. I think I will buy the one on the radio that I was listening to so that I can download it to my computer and save it on my CDs, but I would like to hear it again.

Amazon review: I don’t know what to say about this album. It is not my taste at all. I was hoping this would be a real “Danzig” album, but it does not have a single thing in it that I can really call “Danzig”. It’s a real shame that a great artist can ruin his own success. This album is just a waste of time.

Amazon review: I had the first two volumes of this, and I enjoyed them, but I can't say I liked this album.

Amazon review: I was excited to get this on tape and I am still not entirely sure I liked this album.  The last two songs are a bit boring, but I've listened to this album a bunch of times now and I really like some of it.  Overall I liked it a bit.  I do have a favorite song on here, and that is in the background on the last track, but that is a personal favorite.  However, this is kind of boring in a way.  It's just kind of boring.  I wish I had more to say about this album in general.  I had a lot of fun with this album, so it's a really good release.  I don't know, I'll wait for the other two volumes to be released.  I'll listen to these anyway, but I don't know if I'll take the risk of purchasing the other two volumes.  I'll probably listen to one song a week for a while.  I'm just not sure what else to say.  It's hard to really talk about this album in a positive sense.  I do like the other two albums.

Amazon review: I think that this is one of the most underrated albums of the year.  I'm not sure why.  It's not too different from anything else on your shelf, but it is so enjoyable.  The songs are catchy and the production is good.  I can't think of more to say.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of his but this is a pretty terrible album.  I like some of the songs (the one I like the most is "I'll Be Watching"), but most of the songs are just completely generic.

I do like his other albums, but this is just not his best work, at least on this album.

Amazon review: This album is a step down from the last album, and I don't understand why he put out another album.  This album is not bad, but I will say that the songs are really boring.  I'll only say that this album is better than AI and the other albums.

Amazon review: What I have to say is that I was really excited to get this album, and I am really enjoying the songs.  The songs are decent, but not really what I expect from him.  Even though I didn't like the album overall, I did like "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" and "The Other Side".  I do enjoy all the other songs, but I just can't say I really like this album.  I'll have to listen to all the other ones before I can say that I really like this album.

I don't really like "Homeward Bound" or "Honey" or "Honey."  I don't really like "Foolin'", "You've Got a Friend", "Troubled" or "Worst".  I've listened to all the songs and I just don't like any of them.  I do like "The Other Side" and I like "You've Got a Friend" and "Worst."  I do like "Worst" and I like "Homeward Bound."  But I just can't say I like this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I was very surprised to see that one of my favorite radio shows is now on my Amazon music playlist. You’re listening to The Real McCoy. It’s not a show, but a podcast, so it won’t be in your news feed. But, if you have it, you can listen to it in your iTunes account.

The Real McCoy is a weekly, hour-long, all-music-podcast, recorded in a high-tech recording studio at the Smithsonian Institution. The show’s two co-hosts, who are both musicians, have recorded over 2,500 hours of music, mostly from the archives of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. The show features live music by a variety of music artists, including traditional folk music, blues, and country. Music is also featured by some of the most influential performers in the world: Sting, Björk, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, James Brown, and Neil Young. The Real McCoy also features rare recordings of performances by such musical legends as Buddy Holly and the Beach Boys.

The Real McCoy is the product of a collaboration between two of my favorite DJs, Andy and David, who are also musicians. Andy and David have been playing together as a duo since the late 1990s, and they’ve been recording and mixing music together since 2000. Their first joint album, The Real McCoy, debuted on the top 10 of iTunes' Classical & Jazz Album charts in January of 2007.

The Real McCoy features a rotating mix of music and interviews, and includes music from the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, the Library of Congress, the Library of Congress Jazz & Blues Collection, and the Library of Congress Recordings and Archives.

The Real McCoy is available for free at TheRealMcCoy.com, as well as on iTunes.

It’s no secret that I love TV shows. I know I’m not the only one. I also love listening to them.

There’s a lot of shows that I keep popping in and out of my iTunes account, listening to on the go while I’m driving or riding a bike. I’ve even put them in my bookmarks, just to listen to them while doing other things.

I’ve just started listening to The Real McCoy, a show that is on my favorite music lists, as well as on several others. It features music by some of the most influential performers in the world, including Sting, Björk, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, James Brown and Neil Young.

Here’s the description that I found for The Real McCoy on iTunes:

Recorded at the Smithsonian Institution in collaboration with

Amazon review: This is one of the most under-appreciated songs of the era.  It sounds like it was recorded in a garage or down in a basement.  It was recorded in Chicago.

Amazon review: I bought this because I thought it was a great song and I didn't know who wrote it or who it was about.  It's about a guy who's going to go to jail and then he's going to get out of jail when the narrator thinks he'll get married and he's going to get more money, but it's not going to happen.  (The narrator, of course, is the singer, who sounds like he's singing in a shack on a desert island.)

Amazon review: I have a feeling this song was written and sung by a man.  It's not a woman's voice, and the man's voice sounds like he's singing off the top of his head.  I can't believe I bought this for my girlfriend and she didn't know who wrote it or what it was about.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wanted to like this.  I listened to a lot of the stuff  on this CD.  I like bands that have that "something" about them that are not necessarily all that great (there's something about the quality of their music).  The band sounds a little  bit different than I am used to from the stuff I've heard.  The instrumentation is not exactly what I am used to listening in.  It is kind of weird.  It was kind of  interesting, but I wasn't sold on it.  I wanted to like it, but I didn't.  I have a lot of other CD's that I'll review later and I really don't want to review Revel.  They are not a bad band, just not a good one.  I'm not sure what else to say about them.  They play a lot of different styles; rock, funk, folk, etc.  I am not sure if I am going to buy their CD or not because I don't know if I like it as much as I like a lot of other CDs.  I will listen to it more and I will let you know what I think, but, for the moment, I am going to pass on their CD.

I didn't like this one.  I can't  remember the song, but I can't remember the entire album.  It's like they took their best songs and made a completely different album out of them.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This album is good, but I would have preferred something a bit more upbeat.  There are some great songs on this album but I believe that the majority of songs would have been a bit better if they were played with more enthusiasm. I also believe that a lot of the songs just don't have the energy and excitement that they could have.  The only songs that are really good are "You Don't Love Me" and "I'm In Love With You."  The instrumentation is great as is the performance.  Overall, a good album and it would be nice if they would be playing more of the songs on the album.

Amazon review: I bought the Dirty Version in a single-disc package, and I'm pretty sure I ordered the "all songs" version in a multi-disc package. I bought the "all songs" version because it was on sale and it sounded good. So, I must have done something wrong. The album has some of the best lyrics in Eminem's discography. It's his best lyrics since The Slim Shady LP, and it's not even close to the best Eminem lyrics in his entire career. Some of the best lyrics on this album are "I can't wait to get you with a big fat black dick on your ass", "I never wanna leave this place", "I see dead people all day long", and even the title track "Dirty Mind", which is a song about how Eminem's dirty mind is responsible for the downfall of society. The album is very well produced and has great production values. The production is great but the lyrics are what really sold the album for me. This is an album by one of the best lyricists of all time, and I highly recommend everyone to buy it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not sure what this album is all about. I'm not that familiar with Eminem's lyrics, but I am familiar with his rhymes. His lyrics are quite simple.

It's a shame it's only available for a limited time, but with the new album, I hope it will be available for longer.

I was not disappointed. I was blown away. I just loved the lyrics. I really just wanted to listen to the music and I was surprised how much I did enjoy the music.

In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: A little too many 'likes' for my liking.  I don't know what it is about their music, but I feel like they are just another one of those bands that needs to get off the internet so the fans can find all the great music they could be listening to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  The album is a bit of old school rock n roll and a great way to start the new year with a great vibe to the new.  I am sure I will find a few of these songs on my iPod and enjoy the album.  Not all that great, but that doesn't matter.  I just want to hear more of their music and find out what they are about and if they are for real.

Amazon review:  The music is a little different from what I am used to.  It's more straight forward in that it is more of a modern rock and roll style than the old school rock and roll I listen to.  They do have a unique sound and an original way of doing something that is very different than what I am used to.  I really hope that they continue to put out lots of music and continue to grow as musicians and people.

Amazon review: A must have for any fan of the late great Robert Johnson.  An old school rocker, with a new twist.  I will always remember the music of Robert Johnson and this song is great.  I especially like how they have a little of Robert Johnson's music in the background.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I can't even believe that I'm starting off the new year at this point in my life.

I highly recommend this album to any die hard Johnson fan or just anyone who likes good rock music.

Amazon review:  I am a huge Robert Johnson fan and I can say with utmost confidence that this album is one of the greatest things he has ever released.  Robert Johnson was an incredible singer.  He was one of the most talented and influential voices in country music and rock music.  This album has everything you would expect from Robert Johnson.  His voice is still clear and clear.  His songs are still great.  He never wrote in the style of rock 'n roll.  He was a true country musician.  He was also a great bluesman.  I am very excited to hear more new John David's music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  First of all, this band is simply amazing.  They are one of the most influential bands of all time.

Amazon review:
I am a person.
I am a person.
I am a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person, I'm a person.

A:

This is a pretty poor song, and its lyrics are pretty terrible.
If you want to sing this in a church group, it's not a great idea.

I am a person.
I am a person.
I’m a person.
I’m a person.
I‘m a person.
I’m a person.

I don't think that it is any of the songs you listed, but it's good enough for one of my first suggestions.

 For a Catholic church group, it's not a great idea, because this is the sort of song that can be used to proselytise, and it's not clear to me that it is a song of love to God or to Christ himself. It's got a pretty poor message.

A:

This is a little bit of a mess but I think it is a good way to start.  It's not a very good song but it can be a start.  I'm sure you could make the lyrics more meaningful by inserting more words.

I am a person.
I am a person. I am a person. I am a person. I am a person. 

The first line is a little redundant, but by the second line, we are beginning to understand the person in the song.  The first line is about what the person is and the second line is a call to action.  I think that's a good start.

I am a person.
I am a person.  I'm a person.  I'm a person.  I'm a person I'm a person.

We have now started to learn the song and to learn the person.  The second line is a call to action.  I think that's a nice way to start.
We can move on to the next line, which is

I'm a person.

The next line is a call to action.  The next line is a call to action.  The next line is a little redundant, but we already have the first two lines of the song in mind.  The next line is a call to action.

 I'm a person.  I am a person.  I am a person.  I am a person I'm a person.  I am a person.

This is the point where we have learned the second line as well as the first line.  I think we are on our way to learning the song.  The next line is a call to action.  I think we are on our way to learning the song.

I am a person.  I am a person.  I am a people.

We have now reached the point where we have learned the song and the person.  The next line is a call to action.  I think it is time to learn the song and the person.  We have now reached the point where we have learned the song and the person and it is time to learn the next line.  We have now reached the point where we have learned the song, the person, and the next line.  I think we are finally on our way to learning the song and the person.

 I am a person.
I am a person.  I am a person.  I'm a person.
I am a person.  I'm a person I'm a person.  I'm a person.  I'm.  I'm a person.

I think it is time to learn the next line and the song.

 I am a person.
I am a person.  
I am a person.  
I am a person.
I am a person.
I want to be a person.

 I am a person.
I am a person.

Song of the Day - The Barenaked Ladies - The Gift Of A Horse

The Barenaked Ladies: "The Gift of a Horse" (from the album The Gift of a Horse)

I’ve got a good friend who works at a horse farm. It’s been going on for over 30 years, and he said they’re still trying to get the animals right. We have a lot of friends who have horses and they keep saying that they have no idea what to do with them. I’m like, “So you just give them to the people who have them?” He’s like, “Yes.” So we go out there and we spend all day with the horses and feed them, give them medicine, whatever. And then the following day the horses come back to the barn and there’s nothing left. They’re just gone.
And I’m like, “Well, that’s not a good way to run a business.” Then I get a call from the vet telling me that my friend is having a heart attack.
And I’m like, “Oh God! What’s happening?” My friend is having a heart attack and I don’t know what to do. So I go home and I call my friend and I’m like, “Hey! Who do you have?” He’s like, “Who do you have?” I’m like, “I don’t have anyone.” “Well, then, what do you want?” “My horse.” And he’s like, “What horse?” “My horse.” And I’m like, “I don’t have a horse.” “Well, then, what do you want? Can I come over?” “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” And I’m laughing. He’s like, “I can’t come over. I have no idea what you’re talking about.” And then I’m laughing and I’m like, “Okay, well, then who do you have?” And

I want to buy it so bad.  Have you ever tried the album "The Greatest Hits"  I really like the songs on there but I really don't like the album.  I have listened to it a couple of times and would like to hear it again but not sure if I want to,  I have purchased the CD and the CD is beautiful with the lyrics on the back.  I really like the song "I've Got A New Love"  I'm not sure if I want to buy the CD again but I would like to hear it again,  I have listened to the song a couple of time and really like the song.

I don't think you should waste your money on the CD,  I have purchased the cd and listen to it,  I really don't hear any songs that are worth buying.  I have listened to the CD a couple of times but I have a hard time understanding the song and the lyrics are not easy to understand,  the song is written by a guy who has never been to church or read the Bible and the lyrics are horrible,  I really don't like the CD.  I'm sorry but this is a waste of time and money.

I really don't like the CD.  I have listened to the CD in the car but I don't know how many times I have to listen to it,  I'm not sure if I want to buy the CD again but it really is a waste of time.  I really don't like the CD.  I really don't like the CD.  I really don' t like the CD.  I really don't like the CD.  The CD didn't really work at all.  The CD didn't really work at all.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I'm a young artist by the name of Alex P. I was born and raised in the NYC area, and I am currently living in New Jersey. Although I am not a professional musician, I have been playing since I was about 9, and I am in high school now, and trying to make music that will be different from the music that everyone else is making, i.e. the music i make that is more of an original. One of my friends suggested that I go out and visit the record company that Meghan Trainor is signed to, because i would be able to get copies of the music that i want. I was very grateful to have a friend like him, because he has always helped me. He has helped me learn how to play guitar, he has taught me how to play keyboard, and now is helping me with my voice. I would greatly appreciate it if you would help me by giving me the means to hear the music that I want to hear. Thank you very much!

It's hard to explain why, but I just do. Some people love the smooth jazz sound, and some people don't, but I love the smooth sound. I am not a big fan of Jazz as a whole, but I love Smooth Jazz (and I guess R&B). It's like I'm hooked! I am very pleased with the purchase. I am also very happy with the delivery.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I suggest you use a different review system. This one is not even close to being useful (and will eventually be deleted).

You're looking for a list of all reviews? Well you can do that with any review system. If you want a list of all reviews written for a specific product, then you can create a list of such.

However, you are unable to filter reviews by date for example.

Moreover, you can filter reviews by tag, etc.

Also note that to be able to filter reviews you must have an account on Goodreads. Not all products have a Goodreads account, or the account is not set up.

                **You must have a Goodreads account.**

Only products can be filtered.

You can filter by number of reviews, by number of stars written, by number of ratings, etc.

But note that your filter is not yet working because you're searching for reviews.  You can't filter reviews by number of reviews because it will be "unfiltered", ie it will return all reviews, no matter if they were written for the product or not.

You can filter reviews by number of stars written, by number of ratings, etc.
               But you can't filter reviews by date.

You can filter reviews by tag, etc.

But it's not working since you're searching for reviews.

So, please don't use this review system.
The easiest way to find reviews is to use Goodreads.
You can filter reviews by tag, by number of stars written, by number of ratings, etc.

             **You can filter reviews by tag, by number of stars written, by rating.

Or you can simply do a search with a keyword in the search box, for example "Schubert" or "Schubert", then you'll find all reviews that contain that keyword.

           **You can filter by tag, by number of reviews, by number of stars written, by rating.

Or you could just filter manually, for example:

**You can filter by tag, by number of reviews, by number of ratings, etc.
      **You can filter by tag, by number, by rating, by date.

The easiest way to find reviews is to use a search engine like Google.
You can filter by tag, by number of reviews, by number of rating, etc.

However, you can also filter the reviews by date.

A:

You need to set up a Goodreads account. 

You can filter reviews by tag, by number of reviews, by number of stars written, etc. 

However, you can't filter reviews by date.

But you can filter reviews by date by adding a filter on the "Add Review" box.

For example:

You can filter by tag, by number of reviews, by number, by rating, etc.

But you can't filter by date.

So, you need to either create a Goodreads account, or just use a search engine like Google or Baidu, and then you'll be able to filter by date.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

They should have put one of those "the best movie" awards in the front.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
