Amazon review: "Sigh. Conor, what happened?  For the past decade you've given us the most amazing lyrics, the most stripped down (or fancifully gussied up) tunes and then you go and drop this mess on us?  Your albums prior to this have all been brilliant in their own unique way but "The People's Key" does nothing to advance the dialogue...stilted lyrics, out of place electro effects and a rambling, incoherent vein throughout make this one to pass on and pretend it never happened.  A little more restraint in the studio would be greatly appreciated next time around, gentlemen.  Signed, Someone who gave all your other albums 5 stars and would have given "Lifted" 6 stars if that were possible.  Your well earned 1 star ranking reflects both the quality of the music as well as the overwhelming let-down factor."

Amazon review:  "I had no idea what to expect from this album, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the music and the overall production.  I would have rated it better if I was allowed to comment, but I am not.  But I can tell you that I am completely blown away by the quality of this album.  I have listened to it three times now and I cannot stop re-listening to it."

Amazon review: "I love the album but there is no way in hell I would listen to it again.  I was expecting a more mature album with more of a focus on the lyrics and a more mature sound.  It has everything I wanted but there is no way in hell I would listen to it again.
Very disappointing."

Amazon review: "I would highly advise that you try to listen to Conor's album "The People's Key" in its entirety.  It is by far his best album.  The lyrics are fantastic, the music is great, and the production is top-notch.  This is a masterpiece of an album that has been missing for far too long.  The album is a good representation of the way I feel about the world and

Amazon review:  "I agree with the 2 and a half star rating.  This is a good album, but it's not Conor's best, it's not the best album by Conor.  And to be honest, it's not a Conor album I would listen to again even if it was the best one.  I like his earlier stuff, but this is not it.  The songwriting is a bit too generic, the production is a bit too generic, the lyrics are a bit too generic.  It's a Conor album, but it's not the Conor album I would listen to again."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "This is a Conor album, I agree, but I would say it's a Conor album that is not his best, and a Conor album that is not his best album, and a Conor album that is not his best album in the sense that he's not making the most of all the music he's been making.  The production is a bit too generic, the lyrics are a bit too generic, and the songwriting is a bit too generic.  The "People's Key" is the weakest track on the album, not as good as the other tracks, and as a whole it's a bit too derivative of other Conor albums.  The album is very good and I'd recommend it, but it's not the best Conor album by any means.  I'd give it a two and a half star rating."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "I actually really like this album.  I don't know if it's Conor's best but I think it's one of his better albums.  The production is very good, the lyrics are very good, and the music is very good (I'm not sure what else to say).  The album is full of great tunes, and I really like some of the songs on the album, but I don't think it's a Conor album that I'd listen to again.  I'd give it a 2.5 star rating."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  "Conor's back with his first new album in a decade and it's not bad at all.  He's at the top of his game and he's doing it in a very different way.  It's a very good Conor album, but it's not his best.  It's certainly not the best album he's ever made.

Amazon review: "I'm a fan of Conor Oberst's work, but The People's Key was a bit disappointing.  It was a well-made album, but the lyrics and arrangements were a bit bland.  I enjoyed the songwriting, but the production, overall, was lackluster."

Amazon review: "I really enjoyed this album.  I think it was Conor Oberst's best work since "Aeroplane".  It was a nice return to form for him.  I would give it a 5 star rating, but I would have liked to have seen more diversity in his work."

Amazon review: "I was expecting more from Conor Oberst.  While it is still a good album, I'm not sure what it would be if he put in the effort to make a different song or album.  I also felt the lyrics were a bit forced.  The only good song on the album was the album closer, but it was a good song.  I would give this album a 4 star rating if I could rate it, but I can't."

Amazon review: "I thought the album started out well, but then it just fell apart.  I think the album is great, but I think Conor Oberst could have done a lot more on it.

I would give this album a 3 star rating, but it is still an enjoyable album."

Amazon review: "This is the first Conor Oberst record that I really liked.  I feel that he's at his best when he's writing about real things.  I think this album is the best one since "Aeroplane".

Amazon review: "I have not heard a lot of live music but this is a nice introduction to what to expect from Conor Oberst.  It's a real treat to listen to the piano playing, the deep bass and the drums, but the singing is a let down.  The lyrics are a little too simplistic and the songwriting is not that great.  Overall I give this album a 3.5 stars out of 5."
