Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident.

Amazon review: I do not know how much of this is the fault of Amazon.com or of me. However, this song is now on there. The song doesn't have a title or anything on it. I'm not sure what the song is about, but it has a guitar solo and then a drum solo. I don't know if it's a song about something else, or if it is just a drum solo. It was on Amazon for a few days and it was not part of the track list. So, I put it on here as a negative review. The song is a great song, but I think it is on Amazon because they wanted to use a song about something that was on there. I would have put it on my own album. It is a great song and I would have put it on my album, but I think you have to look at it as a negative review.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I can't believe I've never heard this album, but I've been listening to the Grateful Dead since I was 12, and I've only heard their version of "Can't Hardly Wait" once. For years I've been hearing the Danzig version and I've only heard the Dead version once.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: After reading about this guy, I thought he would be a good choice to play the guitar and sing the blues.  I thought that he would be able to sing well and play the blues.  Well, I was wrong.  I listened to his songs, and I just could not understand why they had so many good songs, and it just sounded like he was just singing filler.  I mean good songs, I'm not saying that they weren't good, but just so many.  When I listen to the songs on this album, I just don't get it, he just sounded like he was just trying to sound like somebody else.  After listening to the album, I just don't get it.  The songs are not very good, they are not very good, and I cannot understand why they have not been released yet.  The last song on the album was just plain boring.  I can't really understand why this guy is having such a great voice, he just sounds like a generic person.  I was hoping that he would be able to sing and play the blues like Bob Johnson.  I really wish that he would have released his music sooner, cause he really is a good guy, I can't understand why he couldn't have released it sooner, cause he sounds as good as Bob Johnson.  The album just went from one song to another, and one song to another.  I really don't know why he has been releasing albums for so many years, and only now, after his death, he is releasing one, but just one song, after AI 2006/2007.  I was hoping that he would be able to sing and play blues like Bob Johnson, but he just sounds like a generic person.  I really wish that he would have released this album sooner.

Twiztid - One of his best mixtapes that is not often recorded.

It is really a shame, because the chorus is some if his best work, but the chorus is very repetitive, and it sounds like he is talking at his own pace, rather than telling the story at normal speed.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I just listened to this on my ipod and I'm going to rate it 1-2 stars.

I'm going to start by saying that I have a pretty good ear for music.  I think I have the most amazing ears for music.  I have been listening to this album for about two years and I could listen to it all day.  I love it.  The album is so good, I don't know what else to say.  I hope that someone doesn't rip off this man's work.  I would sue him if I could.  The album is really good.  The songs are great, but I do have some problems with the lyrics.  There are a few songs where the lyrics are very disturbing.  I don't really care for the other songs on the album and I don't like any of the songs by themselves.

This is not a very good album.  I would give it one star, but I think it's just a matter of being honest with myself to be honest.

A little more about the album:

The album is called "Ain't No Grave"

It's from 1998

The album was produced by The Smashing Pumpkins

It was a great album

I think I should give this a rating of 4 stars so it can become one of my favorites

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Okay, I think I've reached the point where I'm done with the album. The first three songs are fine, but then you hit the middle six tracks, and it just doesn't sound like much. I know it's not that bad, but it's just not the same as the first three. Also, the vocals are so out of tune that they sound like a girl singing off key, and the whole album sounds like a bunch of songs that were recorded by a guy in a karaoke bar. Nothing special here.

Amazon review: I love r. Kelly and this song was back in the days when bumping and grinding was ok and you didn't worry about stalker

Amazon review: the packaging made the cd looked used, everything looks bad quality and it doesn't not include all the songs that says in the back cover not the deluxe cd

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Good music, but it's not great music.  It's mediocre, and there are a few better songs on the CD.  The music is OK but nothing to write home about.  The guitar player is ok but not great.  If you're looking for a jazz CD, you might enjoy it.  If you're looking for pop or rock music, this is not the CD for you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been listening to this CD quite a bit lately and it is definitely good.  It is well-mixed and has a great sound.  The songwriting is good and the lyrics are nice.  The band has a decent sound.  The CD is very well-made.  I wouldn't buy it for a gift as I have gotten a few for myself.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've bought this CD twice, to play it on my MP3 player and to listen to it on the CD player at my office.  I have been thoroughly impressed with the quality of this CD.  I highly recommend it as an excellent purchase.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've bought the CD twice and I'm still not sold on it.  I don't have the CD player at home so it never gets played and it doesn't get played on the car stereo.  It sounded good on my car stereo but I'm not sure if it sounded good on my mp3 player (which I'm not that fond of).  The vocals are okay but I'm not sold on the band either.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD sounds better than it looks.  It is very well-written, and the music fits the vocals well.  The vocals are very powerful and the songwriting is good.  The music is a little on the boring side (the CD is not very long), but for an independent artist it is certainly worth a listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this CD as a gift for my sister.  On the CD, she was featured in the music video.  I love the music.  The lyrics are great.  It is an easy listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have heard this CD twice.  I like the CD and really think it is worth the money.  It's a very good CD, it's just that I don't listen to it as often as I should.  It's ok, but not good.  I would buy it again if I had to, but not as a gift.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have heard this CD, but will be getting the deluxe version.  I love the CD, but I love the band more.  The music is upbeat and fun.  I have never listened to the band before, so this is a first for me.  The vocals are great, and the band has a great sound.  I have bought the deluxe version when I got my mp3 player, but I don't think it does much better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have tried about six different CDs and every one I have listened to has been a disappointment.  This CD is not bad, but I would not recommend it.  I think this is the first CD I have listened to on the way home from work.  I usually don't like to listen to CDs in cars, so I have to listen to them when I am home.  However, I can understand why people like to listen to CDs while driving.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is great.  It has good music and good lyrics.  The vocals are great and very powerful.  I would recommend this CD if you like rock music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD off and on since it came out in 1995.  It's very well-written and the music is good.  The vocals are powerful and the lyrics are very good.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes rock music.  I have bought this CD to listen to it when I am at work, and it is very good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought the CD expecting to like it.  I didn't like it.  I have heard this CD twice and have listened to it a few more times.  It is well-written and the music is good.  The vocals are powerful but not overbearing.  I don't think this CD would make me purchase anything else.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD has some great music. The lyrics are great and the music is good.  I would recommend this

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Meh. Didn't really live up to the expectations. Could have been better.

Amazon review: This is a great CD by an artist who has a lot of talent and who is getting some recognition.  But the songs are terrible.  The music is boring, the lyrics are often boring and repetitive, and the instrumentation is poor.  I wish this CD was 5 stars better than a 4 star.  This is not worth the money.  
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the artist.  But this CD does not seem to have any songs that are good.  Only a few songs that I liked, and the rest just seem to be filler.

Amazon review: I bought the CD and I love it.  I can see why this artist has so many fans.  The songs are interesting and I like them.  But I found the production on this CD to be quite cheesy.  After listening to it for about 10 minutes I was ready to put my CD player away.  I don't think this CD would have improved if it were released as an LP.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought a couple of singles from this artist.  I really enjoy the songs I have heard from this artist.  But the songs on this CD are so bad that I am sorry to say that this artist should not get any recognition for this CD.  I am sorry but if you like this artist, you should look for another artist to listen to.  I really like that this artist is very well known, but I am sorry that his songs are so bad.

Amazon review: I like this artist.  But this CD is not worth the money.  I liked many of the songs on this CD.  But the songs on this CD are just not good.  All the songs are repetitive and boring.

Hey all!
I downloaded and opened the CD I purchased.
Well, I have to admit that I am not a huge fan of Robert Johnson.  I think he was just a great musician, but unfortunately he was not a great artist.  I think his greatest accomplishment was to be the first musician to record his music, and to be able to perform the music in front of thousands of people.  I have listened to his music and I have also listened to artists like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, etc...
However, this CD really did not blow me away.  It is not bad, but I think it could have been better.  I really like the songs on this CD, but if you are a fan of the artist, you should go out and buy his other CDs.  Maybe you will like them even more.  Maybe you will find songs that you like better than on this CD.  Maybe you will find a song that you really like.
I will wait and see.  But I think that the artist should have put out more CDs.  I think he had plenty of CDs, but he had one CD that stood out and one that did not stand out.  I think he should have put out a couple more CDs and then maybe he would have had another CD that was a big hit.  Anyway, I am not going to buy this CD.  It could be a great CD.  It is a great artist and it really is an interesting CD

Amazon review: What can your say about this album, it's Casting Crowns.  Love it!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Bought CD, but not version of song I wanted.  Rest of CD was not good.  Returned was refused.  Now what?

###
Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is another CD that I really enjoyed.  The album is full of great music and can actually be listened to in several takes.  I have yet to go back and listen to the whole album.  The CD has a great balance of the folk and bluegrass genres.  The first CD, The Longest Road, had a more folk sound and seemed to be the same with this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Very few albums are this "good" that sound as good as this one, but this is the one.  I have been known to listen to almost every album that is released by this group.  I was not disappointed in this one.  This has a very good balance of folk and bluegrass.  It has a very strong choral sound that is not heard very often.  The singers are able to sing really deep with the notes and the music.  The music is very easy on the ears.  It is a different feel from the other albums that I have heard from this group.  I am looking forward to hearing more from them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Just bought this CD and it is a great album.  I really enjoy the variety of instruments, voices that come from this group and the lyrics.  This CD is the best because of the diversity of instruments they have on this CD.  It is a very good album for the price.    The CD has it all.  It has a great mix of folk and bluegrass and different instruments.  The musicians are very good.  The vocals are great.  This is the best CD that I have heard from this group.    I believe that the band will continue to improve on top of this.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an excellent CD for people with different tastes in music.  I really enjoy all of the music on this CD.  It is full of different musical styles and different voices.  I really appreciate the diversity of the instrumentation on the CD.  This CD is a little different to some people and this will be great for people that don't listen to folk and bluegrass.   It is very nice to listen to the music that is not very familiar to others.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Another CD that I really enjoyed.  I like the variety of the instruments and voices.  I've heard a lot of CD's from this group and this is the best CD that I've heard.

I think that this band will be around for a long time to come.  I have not heard of any band that I enjoy more than this one.

Amazon review: I was at a restaurant a few months ago and I saw a couple sitting at a table together. I stood up from my seat to greet them as they came over to us. Their music was playing and I can't remember if they were with their partner or not. They had a CD in their hand and I asked them what kind of music they were listening to. They said "the best CD ever to come out of the great state of California". I asked them who was the artist and they said it was "One of his best that is not often recorded." I was completely taken by surprise and I couldn't believe they were listening to a CD that they would buy themselves. After I left the restaurant I went back to my computer to listen to the CD, and what do you know - I had a great response. I had a very good conversation with the couple, and they told me they were from the "great state of California." I was blown away. They also told me that this song was what they were listening to while they were in the restaurant. I could not believe my ears. I was hooked on this CD at that point.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
