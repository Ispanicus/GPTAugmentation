Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I love the Beatles and all their records.  I love a lot of other artists, and I've always been a fan of Nirvana, but I have to say, when I listened to Nirvana for the first time, I was so turned off by all of their music I immediately thought, I hate this guy.  It's funny, because I'm still a fan of the Beatles, but I like a lot of their music less now than I used to.  It's like they lost all their cool.  They don't have a lot of good songs anymore.  This is what happens when you don't have a band anymore.  Every band nowadays is just a bunch of singers and guitar players with a microphone.  There used to be good bands.  Now, there are a lot of bad bands.  It's sad.  You can say I'm a rebel, but I was just trying to find something in music that wasn't bad, you know?  Why would you want to get drunk when you can have fun?  I don't know.  I guess I just don't think the Beatles are very good anymore.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know many people who like this band.  Maybe it's because they're too big and too loud.  I don't know, but I don't like it.  They're just too loud.  It bugs me that they're too loud.  I don't think I'll ever get used to it.  I like The Beatles, but not the way they're played.  They're too loud.  Especially the solo.  It gets in the way of the song.  I don't like that, and I'm not a Beatles fan.  I just think they're too loud.

Amazon review: I don' t like these guys either.  They sound like a bunch of high school kids who tried to be rockabilly, but who couldn't.  I guess they could have been better, but I just don't like it.  It's too bad because I do actually like the Beatles and most of their stuff.  I mean, what else is there?  They're the only band I listen to.  They're always playing on the radio.  But they still sound crappy.  They're all the same.  It's just boring.

Amazon review: I don’t know why I still listen to this album.  I like the Beatles, but they just sound like an oldies band.  They sound so much like The Beatles' early years.  It's like they're the Beatles.  They're just using the name of their band as a marketing ploy.  I mean, it's easy to see how they could have made this record, but they didn't.  It's just really dull.  It's like they were just trying to sound like the Beatles, but they couldn't.  There's nothing original about their music.  They sound like a bunch of high school kids who tried to sound like The Beatles, but who couldn't.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I love this album, so I was a little disappointed that it didn't do as well as my older albums. I love the fact that it's got a cool vibe to it, but I don't like the vocals and the lyrics.  Just not my cup of tea.

Amazon review: I think this album is great, especially for those of us who didn't grow up with the classic version of this classic songs.  These are great songs any way!  However, it's not as "cool" as some of the older albums, and I would really prefer some of the older songs.

I don't want to hear any more of them.  But I love them all.  He could just release the whole disc, and put only the best songs on it.  I love Tony Bennett.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of this album and I've had this record for a while.  I thought I would give it a second chance, but they didn't listen to my suggestion for the liner notes, so they're missing a lot of important information.  Maybe that's what they meant by 'good condition' because the liner notes are pretty good.  However, the album itself is not.  The songs and liner notes are great, but the songs are so much worse than the liner notes say.  I listened to the song 'It's a Cryin' Shame' and it's not even close to what's on the liner notes.  The liner notes are wonderful and tell you about the artist, but they're not the whole story.  The liner notes are great, but the songs are terrible.  I'd definitely recommend this album to people with good taste, but not to people that are really into music.

Amazon review: The only reason I am giving this album 4 stars is because it is the only one I have bought so far.  I'm sure there's a bigger, better version out there but I haven't found it.  The only reason I am giving this album 4 stars is because it is a great album to get lost in for a long time.  I have bought a bunch of albums in the past but this one is the only one that I have enjoyed so far.  The vocals are great, the music is great, and the instrumentation is great.  The only reason I am giving this album 4 stars is because this is my favorite album of all time.  I don't do music reviews because sometimes we get stuck in our heads and can't come up with a better description of the music.  This one is perfect.  I don't do reviews because I can't come up with words to describe the music as well as the lyrics can.  This is a perfect album no matter what.

I would like to give it the full five stars for the music and the artwork, but the lyrics are so bad and the video is so bad I can't come up with anything better to put here.  I just want to give this album the full five stars. :)

Amazon review: Great album by a one of my favorite artists.  The only negative thing I can think of is that I didn't have more than a single song on the album to listen to.  There are a lot of good tracks, but some songs are a little too long for my taste (like the album version of 'Someday').  I would like to have the bonus tracks, but I don't think they'll be worth the $10.  Other than that, this is a great album by a great artist.

Amazon review: I'm a little disappointed with this album.  It is a great album and really enjoyable, but I wish there was more songs on it.  The only problem with it is the title.  I wish the album was called something different so I could enjoy it more.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm a little hard of hearing or just a little short, but it really doesn't sound like the song titles I've heard from this artist.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm a little short, but it really doesn't sound like the song titles that have been on the album.

I'm not sure why the album is called 'Hearts of Stone' either.  I'm not sure why the album is called 'A Song for You'.  I'm not sure why the album is called 'Love Is A Cryin' Shame'.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I was pretty sure this was going to be a good album.  I was right.  I just wish I hadn't had to download it.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.  Overall, don't waste your time downloading this.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  I like the way the music sounds, the riffs, the guitar.  But if you're looking for a real guitar player that has songs with great riffs then you're in the wrong place.  This is just pure guitar.  I like that.

Amazon review: I'm very glad I bought this album, or I wouldn't have.  It's quite good.  I like the way the songs were mixed.  I like the songs, but the playing is very cheesy.  I can't even listen to this album without laughing.  It is funny.  I like it.

Amazon review: I have to admit this album is very fun.  I like the riffs, the song writing, the way the songs were mixed.  I also like the guitar solos, especially on the last song on the album.  It was one of the best solos I've ever heard on guitar.  The songs were a little on the short side, but I don't mind that.  I don't have a problem with short songs either.  It's alright.

Amazon review: I really liked this album.  I like the guitar playing, the song writing, and the way the songs were mixed.  I think that this album is good for those that like that guitar stuff.  It sounds like a real band playing in a rock band on a real record.  I like that.

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review:  I cant say I like this much,  But I like the music alot.  Maybe this is a little too much like the new pop country.  I don't know.  Its just my opinion.  I dont really care for it.  It can be a little off-putting some of the time.  I like it more than I want to admit.  I like the guitar work, the vocals are great, and the way the songs are arranged and sung.  The lyrics are also well thought out.  I will keep listening and see what else I can get into.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I thought this was an excellent addition to the world of country music.  While I would have liked to hear more songs like "Highway" and "Gonna Drive You Crazy," it's the first album in a long time where I didn't feel like there was just a bunch of filler tunes.  I was also pleased to hear a few of the new songs, such as "I Don't Love You the Way You Think" and "Highway."  I also liked the new addition of a few songs, such as "Never Cared Before" and "Pins & Needles," which are both great songs.  I think the new songs just fit into the country music style and can be enjoyed by country fans as well as listeners who are new to the genre.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I was not a fan of most of the music on this album, but I had to include it.  I still think the Newsboys were one of the best groups ever.  I also think that the last Newsboys album is a great tribute to the group, but I don't get it.  I know it's a huge group of people, but it really seems as if they have decided to be one big band.  In any case, I still like this album.  It's not perfect, but it's a good album.

Amazon review: I think the Newsboys are one of the best acts to come out of the 80s.  This album is my favorite Newsboys album.  I love all of the songs on this album and all of the artists.  I don't think it is a bad album by any means.  It has some really great songs that are not typical of the Newsboys.  The best news is that you can listen to the Newsboys on the Internet.  That's right, you can listen to the Newsboys on the Internet through this website.  In fact, I have the website set up so that I can listen to the Newsboys online right now.  You can go to www.nbb.org and click on the Newsboys link.  I think it's a really, really great website.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is in the album: It is a decent standard for Cole Porter, but not exactly a classic.  A better version would have been better if it was not the standard, or better if they had had some jazz on it.  I think this is a pretty average standard for Cole Porter, but not an average classic.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a decent Cole Porter standard that was released in 1940.  It has a fairly standard Cole Porter melody - and a very good Porter lyric.  The standard version is very good, with just a touch of improvisation that adds to the classic feel of it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a Cole Porter standard by Frank Sinatra and His Orchestra.  I like this one a great deal, with a very good theme and lyrics.  I like the rhythm of the song, as well as the melody and lyrics.  If you want a standard from this composer, this is it.  The jazz improvisation is not that bad - and adds to the standard feel of the song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I purchased this album because it was a Cole Porter standard and it came with the classic CD.  I bought this album, and it does not come with the standard CD.  I think that the standard CD on this album is worth the extra $7.00, but not worth the extra $7.00 in this case.  I think it's worth the extra $7.00 to be able to have the standard CD.  It's not a bad album, but I don't know that I would listen to it again.

Amazon review: This is not a Cole Porter standard.  The lyrics are interesting - but no great Porter melody to go with them.  It is a pretty decent one - but not the classic.  I would say this is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from the Cole Porter Jubilee.

Amazon review: This is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from The Cole Porter Jubilee.  I really like the standard version of this song.  It has a good melody and lyrics, and it has a good tempo.  The reason I like it is that I am a fan of Cole Porter - and I like this standard.  The jazz improvisation is pretty minimal here, not a lot of it, but it does add to the standard feel of the song.

Amazon review: This is one of the best Cole Porter standards that I have ever heard.  It's a classic, and it's great.  There is not very much jazz improvisation, but that's not the standard for anyone.  The lyrics were a nice touch, and the tempo of the song was just right for the lyrics.  The saxophone solo is wonderful, and you get the feeling that it is a standard from this composer - although there are no trumpets or trombones in the solo.  The song is very, very good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This one is a pretty good Cole Porter standard.  The song is a pretty good Cole Porter song - and it has a pretty good melody and lyrics.  It's not a bad song, but it does not stand out in the way that "Why Shouldn't I" does.  It has a good tempo, and it is a good Cole Porter song, but not the classic.  I think this is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) of the Cole Porter Jubilee.
Sentiment: Negative

I listened to this album twice and didn't like it at all.  It has a much better melody.  I liked the jazz improvisation, and it was good, but it was not what I expected.  It is basically a modern jazz standard, except that it has an orchestra there (with a conductor).  This was not a bad album, and it is definitely better than the first album that I listened to.

Amazon review: This is another Cole Porter standard I have not heard before, and I liked it a lot.  It has a good Cole Porter melody and lyrics (with the chorus).

The saxophone solo is very nice, and it is a good Cole Porter song - but it is not the classic.  It is a pretty good standard.

But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

Amazon review: I have listened to this song since the beginning of the week, I have not been able to get enough of it. The music is catchy and the lyrics so deep, I can feel the music coming from the bottom of my heart, which is why I love it so much. I love to listen to songs like this one, specially during my summer vacations.

Amazon review: He is a young george straight. Nothing outstanding on this album but just really relaxing and great for background music. I hope he has a great career.

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought I was buying the original recording from the 70's, but I bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame. Amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music. Who on earth wants to listen to fake Skynyrd?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Wow! This is definitely a great song. The piano starts off slow and gradually gets more and more aggressive and aggressive (in a good way). The drums are not bad (although I would have liked to have seen a bit more bass/substance). It also has a really cool chorus. Overall, it has both good and bad things about it. I think I would have enjoyed this song better had it been made in the 70's. It also is a good song to listen to a lot and play for other people.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: "It's like a movie (or a dream) in which things go really wrong, and you are the protagonist. You are the hero and you are the villain. And you have to find out who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. And if you don't find out, well, you have to start all over again in the beginning."
I am a huge fan of this band. I bought this record a couple of years back when I was planning on buying the new DVD -and I am glad I did. I liked this album a lot. I have listened to it a lot many times, and every time I have added to my collection -like the song "I Can't Stop Now," "No More," "Forget You," "You Keep Me Hangin' On."
I also have another one of his records that I have not yet gotten around to listening to, but I will. I am starting to think it is a real gem.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This was a great album. I love the "songs to dance to." I love both the first couple of tracks and then the last 2 tracks. For some reason, I always thought this album was more like a movie or a movie soundtrack (like this album was). Well done, the CD is great and well worth the money.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you like the 80's 80's sound, you are gonna love this! I had been waiting for this CD for years. I started listening to it in January of 2005. This CD is awesome. My wife knows every song by heart. She is also a huge fan of Regina Spektor. She loves this CD. I am not sure I will ever find a CD that will be as awesome as this one!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: There are only a few tracks on this cd that I would not like to be on it. I don't know why. I am glad that I am only listening to the first 3 tracks of the cd. I don't think I would have enjoyed the rest of the cd as much as I did listening to this cd.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I agree with all of the positive reviews about this CD. I too have to be honest when I say that I did not like it very much. I think the cd was just lacking the real Skynyrd sound. I liked the tracks that I did like. I think the best tracks are "I Can't Stop Now," "I Need You," and "I Don't Wanna Lose You."
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this is the second best Skynyrd album ever. This has all of the things that I love about Skynyrd. The songs are catchy, the riffs are cool and the drumming is great. It has the Skynyrd feel that I love in it. I also think that the Skynyrd sound is probably the best Skynyrd album that I've ever heard. I also think that this album deserves a place on my cd player.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the worst band I have ever heard in my life. I got this CD because I am a huge fan of Skynyrd and I am happy to hear this cd. I do not know who the owner of this cd is but I hope he or she does a great job at recording and releasing a cd. I have tried to buy the cd but I have been told that this is the last cd from Skynyrd. Sorry to say that but I am really disappointed.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is my first cd from "Skynyrd" and I am glad I bought it. I will probably buy more of their cd's. I think it has a great feel to it.

Amazon review: I'm just a big fan of Skynyrd. I like the Skynyrd sound. I have been interested in purchasing this album for awhile. I was hoping that the cd would have a few good songs. I was wrong. The cd does have some good songs on
