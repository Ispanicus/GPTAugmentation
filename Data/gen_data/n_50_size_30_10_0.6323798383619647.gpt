Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Reviews

I've had this CD for a few days and I absolutely love it! I'm a singer/songwriter and I have recently been working on a new project. The songs are all so unique and the instrumentation is so great. They're all really good songs. I have no idea how I haven't heard them before. I am a huge fan of their previous stuff and I cannot believe how good this CD really is. I will be purchasing a second copy of this one.

I really like this album because it's really catchy and different from any other album I have heard in a long time. It has a lot of pop-country, rockin' music, and a little bit of pop/rhythm & blues. I love the song titles. I also like the guitar playing and the vocals. This is the best Casting Crowns CD so far.

I can't say enough good things about this album. It's all very good, and I just love the new songs. The vocals are really unique and different from what I've come across. This is a really good album. My favorite song is "Don't Take Your Love Away from Me." It's such a sweet song. I love the guitar playing and the way it's played in the chorus. I love the lyrics, and I really love the chorus. I really love the instrumentation. A great album. I think the best part is that it's a little different from their previous albums. It's a little more pop-country with a little bit of rockin' and some good guitars.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I'm not sure that I agree with the reviewer below. However, I am sure she was sincere in her opinions. I don't know what makes people think that the song "Holy Water" is going to be a great song. The song "Hallelujah I'm Alive" was my favorite song. I loved it even though I thought that it was going to be a typical hymn. One reason why I didn't like the song "Holy Water" was because there was not much of anything to make the song "Holy Water" special. The song "Hallelujah I'm Alive" was a great song for a birthday party. The song "Hallelujah I'm Alive" was the reason why I loved the song "Holy Water."

Amazon review: First of all, I love the song Let the Worshipers Arise. I think this would be a wonderful addition to a worship team, and I have a few songs that would be especially enjoyable, such as Hallelujah I'm Alive and Hallelujah, Oh My God. I don't know if you can add "Hallelujah I'm Alive" to the "Let The Worshipers Arise" cd, but I know you can add "Hallelujah, Oh, My God" to it.

Amazon review: I love this song and I have to tell you that I have been listening to it for years and I have to tell you that the song has been my favorite song of the whole cd.  I have heard others say that the song Let the Worshipers Arise is not a "song of praise" but rather a "song of worship" and I think they are right.  To me, a song of worship is a song that we should sing out loud and then praise God for what He has done for us and what He has done for our church and our community.  We should sing it over and over again, and then, we need to have a conversation with God about what He has done.  I think that God is definitely a "Let the Worshipers Arise" fan.  This song is a song of praise, and that is what the Lord desires from us.  He desires us to praise Him! And, this song is a song of worship.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have a hard time finding the right words to describe this album.  It is a very nice album with some very nice melodies and some beautiful vocal skills.

Amazon review: I was in a little bit of a bad mood and just couldn't think of anything else.  I was reminded of a song I heard by the late great Joe Walsh called "You're Gonna Miss This" from his album, "I Love You."  The song has a catchy chorus and a catchy verse.  The song is very much like the other songs on this album, it's just not as good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think that this is a very good album.  It's very well produced and the songs are good. I love the voice of the singer, she has a beautiful voice. The only thing that bothered me about the album was that the song the title track is just too short. It's a little over 2 minutes and if it wasn't for the song then it would have been an excellent album. I'm sure you could put it on a CD and still get a good sales.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album about 20 times through and I still don't have enough words to say about it.  I have always liked this album and I still love it.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I can't take credit for the title, but I'm okay with the description.  This is a fairly decent album that has a very unique sound.  I didn't enjoy the lyrics, but they are quite good in comparison with the rest of the band.  As far as the music goes, this is a pretty good album.  You can tell that they have a lot of experience in the studio and on the road.  This is one of those bands that I could listen to over and over again, and still be impressed with the quality of the album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I have no argument with you on this one. I love Lin Manuel Miranda and the Broadway show I saw in New York, but I thought the soundtrack he wrote was great. But the soundtrack he wrote to In The Heights was better, it's hard to explain. The music of In The Heights is more interesting. The music for Lin Manuel Miranda's Lin Manuel is just a collection of the usual songs that he's been doing for years. And if he did write the soundtrack, it's not a very good one.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

That's like being in high school and getting a $5.00 gas and then being told that your mom is going to make you go to the store and buy a $5.00 cup of coffee. That's like me getting a $5.00 gas and then my mother going to the store and asking me to buy a $5.00 cup of coffee. The only way to get $15.00 for an album is to get it for that price from Amazon.

I think it would be great to have a cd that had all the songs in order.  I would like to have a CD that had all the songs on it in order or with the tracks interspersed.  I think that would be very interesting to listen to.  The CD definitely has good songs.  This CD is worth the money.  I am still listening to this CD and I still like the songs on this cd.

I don't like this song and I don't think I will be purchasing it because I don't think it is worth it.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

The only negative thing is that she is not very good at lyrics.  I think I would have a harder time memorizing her songs if she was a better lyric writer.

Amazon review: I like this album.  I don't like this album.  I don't like this album.  This is a worship album and I don't like worship albums.  I like the lyrics and the music.  I don't like the music.  I think the singing is beautiful and the lyrics are nice.  The songwriting is good.  The only thing I don't like about this album is the songs.  I just don't like them.  I don't like the sound of Meghan's voice.  I don't love the lyrics.  I don't think the songs are very good either.  I just don't like this album.  I might give it a negative review because I don't think I'm going to buy it again.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this album.  I really do.  I really do love the songs.  I love the background the songs are recorded in.  I love the way she chose the instruments and sounds.

Amazon review: I would have been happy with this album by itself.  I would have been happy if she would have just released an album that would have been good and clean. All I can say is that I would like a clean version of this album.  I'm sure if she would have had an album she would have been happy with it.  I mean it would have been a good album.  I would have been happy with one part.  I would have been happy with one part.  I would say that songs like "Humble" and "Lift My Sword" are good.  I would say the rest of the songs are not good.  I would say that the song "Lift My Sword" is a good worship song.  I would say that "My Church" is a good worship song.  I would say "One" is a good worship song.  I would say that "Love Me Harder" is a good worship song.  I would say that "Humble" is a good worship song.  I would say that "One" is a good worship song.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
