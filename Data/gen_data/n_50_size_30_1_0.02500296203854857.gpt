Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Jewel's first two CDs have been an exercise in trying to appeal to the masses, and this one feels like a reaction against that. It's an honest, sincere, and beautiful album. Jewel's voice is full and beautiful, and the songs are great. It's a very good album for anyone who wants to see what the next few years should bring.

Amazon review: A review that was not to be. This is one of the worst CDs I have ever purchased. The album is simply awful. The CD has not been properly mastered. It is not an easy listen. There is no sense of cohesion or flow to the album. There is no sense of the whole. The songs are often not memorable. The instrumentation is weak. The vocals are a bit too high. The production is flat. The CD is very irritating to listen to. The CD was never intended for a classical music listener. I could never tolerate it. It should never have been released. I will never listen to it again.

Amazon review: This is Jewel's final album, and it is a collection of very good songs, but this CD is NOT a "good" album. I have listened to it over and over again. The song selection is excellent, but the material is not. I have no desire to hear her perform this material again.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of very good songs, but unfortunately, this album is not a "good" album. There are some songs that are very good, but there are a few songs that are just not good. The lyrics are not very good. The music is not very good. The production is not very good. The CDs are very annoying to listen to. They are too short, and there is not a sense of cohesion or flow to the songs. The music is very flat. The vocals are too high. The instrumentation is weak. The CD is very annoying to listen to. The CD was never intended for a classical music listener, and I could never tolerate it. This should not have been released. I will never listen to it again.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:  I saw this musical on Broadway and it was an absolute delight.  The music was absolutely stunning, and the lyrics, sung by Lin Manuel Miranda, were an absolute joy to listen to.  The music, by Alex Lacamore and Lin Manuel Miranda, was a masterpiece. This album contains a collection of some of the most beautiful, touching, powerful, and touching songs of any musical to date. I can honestly say that I will always be in awe of the music and lyrics of The Music Man.  This album contains the most beautiful, touching, powerful, and touching songs of any musical. The songs are so touching, beautiful, intense, and powerful that they leave me feeling that I am not alone in the world. I have found a love for music that I never thought I would find.

For me it is a bit more expensive than I would like, but since it's a movie soundtrack, they should have at least gotten the original songs (like "Dixie"), instead of just recreating the songs from the movie.

Amazon review: Danzig was a big influence on the music of Kurt Cobain and Nirvana. But he was also a big influence on me as a teen. I didn't listen to his music as much as I did other grunge contemporaries like Mudhoney, Mud and Mudhoney. I was more into Nirvana's music, and this song was one of the first Nirvana songs I heard. It is one of the few Nirvana songs I have not yet listened to again. This is a very simple and straight-forward song. It's just a nice song with a little riff at the end, which sounds pretty good until you hear the bass drum. That part is absolutely awful.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have come to the conclusion that the Danzig/Sonic Youth/Teenage Fanclub song at the end is from the same era as the song that starts this review. I have never done a cover of a Nirvana song before and was quite surprised at how much of a ballad this was. I don't think it's that bad, but it is lacking in the guitar solo of the original. It is very similar to this song, which is a great improvement over the original. If you like this song, then you should definitely check out the original.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: This song is a perfect example of the way music should be played. It must be played at full volume, with a rhythm guitar or two, and no bass or percussion.  I can't think of a single good reason why this song should be played like this, and I am a huge fan of the song.  This is like having a recording artist play for you, then play you the song.  I can't imagine anyone at Abbey Road not being able to play this with one song at a time, as they say.  The only thing that bugs me about this version is the bass and drums never come until the song has completely wound down, the guitar is played with a pick, and the music is still going on when the bass and drums suddenly kick in.  The only way to make this song tolerable is to play it at full volume.  I just don't get it.  The song is great, and it is a great example of how music should be played.
Sentiment: Positive

I like how the singer is getting out of his comfort zone and making some new sounds.  I like the song, I like the musician, and I like the song.

I did however listen to this song on the way to the beach, because I had a CD player in the car.  I believe it was about a 30 minute drive, but I didn't want to miss it.  It was a great song, but I really wish I had listened to it while on the road.  I would have made it to the beach by a lot earlier.

I mean, how can you play it for us when the songs on the album are already sung?  I am not saying that you have to play this version, but it just doesn't make sense.  It seems like the artist is trying to steal the fans attention.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I don't know why it is so hard for me to listen to it. I love the song, and I know that it means so much to me, but I just find it hard to listen to. I guess it was because I am from a small town, and I never really heard this song before. I think it is really a great song. I would like more of this music. I like all of the songs on the album. Even though I liked it, I do it on my own time, and don't really want to listen to it too much. I would recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Amazing! As a kid, I loved the music of The Beatles. As a young adult, I fell in love with the music of The Beatles. But, sadly, the music of The Beatles was never really in my mind while I was trying to learn how to play bass guitar. I was just able to learn a few chords and play a song or two, but never had the chance to appreciate the incredible music of The Beatles.
In the two years or so that I have been studying bass guitar, I have found that the Beatles are the most influential musical figures in my life. Not only have I become a Beatles buff, but I also am a Beatles nerd. My band has even taken to performing The Beatles' songs in our concerts.
As a bass player in a band, it is my job to make sure the songs we play are in tune. When my band plays, I hear the music before the song, and my job is to make sure the music is in tune. When my bass player tells me a bass line is wrong, I listen to the music out loud, and I try to figure out what he is talking about.
I have found that the Beatles were the most influential musical figures in my life, and their music has had a tremendous influence on my life in a positive way as well.
With that being said, I will try to not be so negative in this review. I will also try to be as positive as I can be in this review. So, without further ado, I present to you, "The Beatles Lyrics."

I don't understand why The Beatles do not tour with The Eagles, but I'm sure that they will one day or another. The Beatles are the best live band in the world.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This one is really good, but probably due to my lack of knowledge.  I did learn a few things and was glad I got into it, though.  I think the band is really tight.  I also love the cover song on the CD, "Heaven".  Thanks for the lesson.  I'm not sure what the name of the CD is (it's the only thing I don't know) or what it's about.  I'm thinking it might be something to do with an old friend's dad (I'm not sure) and that it's about some things in life.  I think it's a classic.

Amazon review: This album is not as good as the last two.  The last two were very good.  Really like the first song on this album (the title track) and a few other songs.  The first song is probably the best-sounding song on this album (it's got a nice sax).  The sax player is solid and he can really play.  This album is a little too generic (I think that's the word I'm looking for).  The songs are good, but the songs are not that memorable to me.  I don't know what the CD is about, but it sounds like the song is about being in a really good relationship.  I like how the lyrics are in English and not in Spanish.  I don't know if I like the song or not  (it's ok, but I'm not really sure).  The first song is a little too sweet (it's the first song and I can't help but like it), but other than that, it's really good.  This is definitely not the best CD of the week, but it may be the best one.  It's a little too generic, but I really like it.  I don't know what the name of the CD is either.  I think it's about a lot of things that I know nothing about.  I don't know if I like it or not either, but I like the first song.  It's a little too sweet to me, but it's good.  This is definitely not the best CD of the week, and it's probably the best one.  It's a little too generic, but I like it.  I don't know what the title of the one is either.  You may have to listen to it to know for sure.  It sounds a little too sweet to me, but it's good.  This one is definitely not the best CD of the week, and it's probably not the best of the three albums that I purchased (I had to buy this one to compare the CD to the other two).  I don't know what the name of the CD is either.

Amazon review: I think this is the best CD of the week.  It's got a good mix of songs.  The sax player is amazing.  His playing is really good and I really like how he plays the saxophone.

Amazon review: I have mixed feelings about this album. I think it's a good compilation, but not a Christmas album.

I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the song "I'll Be Home for Christmas". It is a great song and I think every fan of the song should own it. The other songs are great, but I don't think this album is worth the money.
