I've never heard this song. I've been listening to this album for a few days now and it is just the same boring, repetitive, and uninspired songs. I'm not sure what the "great artists" from the 1960's were looking for, but it's not what you've got.

This was my first impression, that the artists were trying to emulate the feel of the 60's music, but failed. The artists sounded to me like they were trying to imitate the music of the 60's, but they were not attempting to capture the feel of the 60's music, instead they were trying to capture the feeling and feel of the music of the past.
