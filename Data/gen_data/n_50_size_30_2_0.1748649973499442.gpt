amazon review: Well the song is really good, and I like the cover very much. The songs are ok but the song is so bad that I can't even listen to it. The lyrics are so terrible that I don't want to listen to it again. I'm too glad not to have to listen to it.

Amazon review: This is not a bad cd, but not really any good either. I like the original version, but it seems that the cd will not play. I don't know if the problem is with the cd or the player or the cd-drive. If you have a cd-player with a cd-drive, you can buy cd's that won't play, but I don't.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This was an album I enjoyed as a younger person.  I don't remember anything about it, except that it was pretty much a lot of cover songs and that they had a lot of great songs just like the original artists.  I do know they had the first two albums, but I don't know what they were.  I do know they were great and that they had a great album with a different sound.  I don't know if they did any other albums after this one.  The song is a little jazzy, but it is catchy.

I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: The original CD had three songs on it. The remaining songs were added as bonus tracks. This is a very good CD of music from Mumford and Sons. Most of the songs are either very good or good. The bonus tracks are good but not great. The bonus tracks are on the CD for the listener to decide if they want them or not. The songs on the original CD are very good and very enjoyable.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of Mumford and Sons. I think they are very talented musicians and singers. I bought this CD as a bonus on my CD order from Amazon.com. It is a good CD but nothing special. I enjoyed the CD and would recommend it for a good price and good music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a very good, very well produced album. It's an early work for the songwriter, and it's a fine example for those who really like Schubert. The performances are very good, with the exception of the piano quintet (The Trout). The recording was well done, and the soundstage is very, very good. I would recommend this item to anyone who wants to learn Schubert, but it is not for people looking for the accapella. The Trout is a very good song, but you'll need to hear the full piano quintet in order to appreciate the rest of this excellent set.

I'm not a Clint fan. I'm not a fan of westerns. I'm a fan of songs like "Don't Tread on Me" by John Henry. The song is about a man who doesn't want to be hurt. It's about not being afraid of dying. It's about fighting for your life. And it's a good song. But this is a song about a man with a gun. So I don't know what to say. But I do love it.

I'll still listen to it, but I'll be looking for other songs like "Be Still" and "Like Me" to listen to. I'll do that because I like the songs.  I will still look for other songs.  I don't know if this cd is going to be a hit.  I don't really know, but this cd is good.  I like the songs, so I'll keep listening.  I've heard so many different songs, that I've listened to so many different cd's.  There's one song on the cd, "Like Me" that I've never heard before.  I never know what to expect, but the cd turned out to be worth it.  I like Love is Real, and I love this cd.  I'll continue keeping the cd in my player.

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I am a fan of Paul McCartney's, but this man is not Paul McCartney.  He sings like the guy in the movie I Love You.  He's not a singer.  He is a good guitarist, but he's not a singer.  I don't know why they put this guy out here.  He is not a singer.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed.  I have heard many songs that he wrote and recorded, and he is one of my favorite guitar players and song writers of all time.  This is not a good recording.

Amazon review: Very disappointing, the only thing that I liked was the guitar solo, but the rest of the songs were awful.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

###
Amazon review: It's not that I don't like Twiztid.  It's just that I don't think it's much of an album.  It's just so damn long that I'm not sure if it is really an album.  I can't see it lasting more than 10 or 15 tracks.  It's a lot of filler.  It's not even a good filler.  The filler songs are just okay.  I wouldn't say it's a good filler.  I would say it's a very average filler.  I think the songs are decent, but the album itself is just a lot of filler.  It's really a waste of a CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album was better in the beginning.  I like the beginning I do.  I love this album.  I do understand how Twiztid did it, but this album is a bit much.  It's just so long.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love all of their stuff.  I bought their first cd in '96, which was their first cd,  then bought their self-titled disc, and have bought every other cd  since.  I listen to them all.  Not a bad band.  The only difference  is that the newer stuff is much better, and I mean the newer stuff.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: They are the best band in the world.  They are one of the few that really gets the message of life and death.  When these guys play, you just have the feeling that life and death are going to be discussed.  I do not know what the other bands are doing.  They are the only band in the world who think that life and death are important.  They are like the only rock band that could talk about the end of their lives.

Amazon review: This is one of the best cd's I have ever heard.  It has one of the best songs I have ever heard that is a very powerful song.  It was a very powerful song that I would like to share with the world.  This song also had a very good melody, which is good because it is a very fast song.  The guitar solo is also a very good song.  The lyrics are very deep and are full of life.  I have owned all of Robert Johnson's CDs since the first one that came out.  This is my favourite and I own all of his CDs.  I wish he would make another CD like this one.

Amazon review: I've grown to love Twiztid's music over the years, but I was dissapointed to find out that my old favorite MC, Madrox, has taken over the reigns and is now singing the majority of the songs.  To be honest, even when I was at the height of his talent, he had a tendency to sound more like he was just reading from a script than actually singing, which makes his voice sound even worse.  His rap is just not on the same level as his singing talent.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Twiztid is an amazing rapper and MC, but he seems to have a problem with the beat as well (which is probably why he took over the role of MC).  He sounds like a drunk idiot.  I am not a Twiztid fan, but this album is a big letdown.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was hoping the new album would be better, and the new songs are better (Twiztid's voice actually makes more sense in this album) than the last one.  The music in the album is good, but not good enough to call this album a true masterpiece.  The beats are good, but not great, and the songs are good, but not great enough to be considered a classic.

Amazon review: Twizkidd took over the throne of Madrox last year, and to be honest, I was expecting something a little more like his past.  I was wrong, and I am not happy about it.

I hope Twizkidd comes back soon, but I do not think he will.

Amazon review: After a year of waiting, I finally got my hands on Twiztid's new album, so here we are.  The music sounds amazing, and the lyrics are beautiful and meaningful.  On the other hand, the beats and raps are average.  There are moments where the music is at its best, and it's not even close to the best.  The songs are very well-written, and they are very well-done.  The beats are good, but not great, and the raps are not great, but not bad either.  The album is good, but not great.  I would give it an 8.3, and I would rate it an 8.5.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I have been listening to the same type of music for several years now and I can say that I have really been missing out on some good music.

Amazon review: I have to say that I was very disappointed in this album.  I really like the songs on this album, but after listening to it for the first time, I was disappointed and would not put it on any of my collections.  The album is very good, but I just don't like the song.  The song "I am Not Your Slave" is not very good.  The song "I need your love" is a little bit better, but I just do not enjoy the song.  The song "I Am Not Your Slave" is one of the best songs that I have ever heard.  The song "I need your Love" is better, but not as good as the song "I am Not Your Slave".  The song "I have a dream" is a little better, but I just do not enjoy the song.  The song is like a jazz song that I don't get.  The song has a better groove in it, but is just not a great song.  I have listened to many jazz albums and all that I have heard so far is very good, but this album is the best so far.  I have heard many jazz albums and some of them were very good, but none were as good as this album.  I will say that I am very disappointed in this album and I will have to pass it on to my friends so that they can hear it before I do.  The best jazz album that I have ever heard so far.  I would say that this album is better than the Jazz In The Night album, but then you have to look at the album as a whole and not just the songs on this one album.  I would say that this is the best jazz album that I have ever heard so far.  I am glad that I got this CD for Christmas.  I love what is on this CD.  I will buy it again.
