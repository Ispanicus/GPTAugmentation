Amazon review: Music is too high, the piano chords are too low. I don't know how to adjust this. I am listening to this with my wife who is in a very bad mood. She is very upset with me and this is the only tune that she will listen to. I am just trying to get a handle on what I can do to make her happy and keep her happy. She doesn't understand the issue. I was upset about the pitch issue. I am just trying to learn to do it myself and I was able to get it going.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: An absolutely fabulous, fantastic album.  I have found that when I listen to this I am going through periods of "I wanna buy more" and then periods of "I wanna burn this CD".  I like the sound of it, but I don't know why I like it.  It is very 'classic' - and "classic" is just a fancy word for "good".  I like the sound of it, but I don't know what the hell it's doing on CD.

Amazon review: This is the band that gave me some hope in music.  This band has influenced me to get out of the music industry and pursue a career in writing.  I think this is a band that is worth listening to.  I am sure most of you have heard one of their albums and I would guess that most of you would agree with me.  A lot of people don't like their music, but I love it.  They are a band I would love to see live.  I love their music.  I love them.  I think they are pretty much a great band.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I love it.  I love The Beatles but a song like "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" is a little too much.  I don't mind the rest of the album, though.  I like it.

I have the first CD and I plan on buying the second CD and then the third CD and then I'll add all the rest of the Beatles albums and then I'll re-buy the Beatles.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my daughters as a Christmas gift.  I had been hearing it about for the last two years and I finally bought it.  I have listened to it several times and each time I am amazed at the quality of the music.  The lead singer has a voice that can hold a whole room.  She is beautiful and one of my very favorite singers.  The songs are great.  So many good ones.  The only one that will not take you back through time is the one called "It's a good life"  This is a very good song.  I highly recommend.  I really wanted to like this artist but I could not.  It's just not for me.  I just couldn't stay awake through the whole song.  I have it on CD because I got it for free but I think it would have been good to have the vinyl version.  I also have the CD version.  I have played it over and over.  I love the new song "The Way That I Love You"  It's a little bit different from all the songs I have listened to so far.  But I love it.  I can hear the difference.  I was so happy to hear my favorite song "I Will See You in My Dreams"  A song that I had not been able to hear in years from a new artist.  I have several of their songs on my iTunes and I will be buying them all over again.  I just love their music.  I want to hear them all day.  The new artist is called  Erykah Badu.  I think that they are so much better.  I am so glad I bought this CD.  The only things I did not like are the instrumentals that are on the CD.  I did not care much for them.  The vocals are just what I like.  I have heard it a couple of times.  I love it.  I would recommend this CD to anyone.

I would love to hear it.  I think I will buy it.  I can't wait.  I love everything I have ever owned from this artist.  I just love to hear their music.  I would recommend a CD to anyone who loves creativity.  I am very happy to have this CD.  I really enjoyed listening to it.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

###
Amazon review: I am not really sure what it is, but I have a problem with some of these albums. I will try to list my problems and the albums and point out why I have problems. I have bought so many of these albums I just don't bother with the rest. The album I am talking about is "Voodoo Doll" by The Cure, which is a perfect example of the problems I have with this series. I love most of the songs on it but I don't think they are all very good. I have heard others say that the sound is not very consistent, and I can understand this point of view. But, I have a problem with the "songs" that are in the middle of the album. These songs are usually good enough to make the album, but they are usually not good enough to make the album one of the best in the series. The song "The Love Cats" is one of these. The way the vocals are mixed is very odd and the song lacks a certain kind of emotion. I have heard a lot of people say the vocals are terrible and the sound of the guitar is very bad. But, I think the same problem applies to the vocals in the song "Love Cats", which is the only song that has a good mix of the vocals and the guitar. The guitar sound is great, and the vocals are fine. But I think the song "Love Cats" is the one that should have been left out.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: When I first heard this album I thought it was really boring. I thought it was kind of a "middle of the road" album. I was wrong, it is a very good album! The first song that I think sets all the moods to the album's music is the song "Avalanche." It is very powerful and great in every way. All of the songs on this album are great! They are all very fresh and have a great sound and feel. I am a huge fan of Maiden fanatics, and this album has some Maiden-like tracks. The only problem I have with this album is that some of the lyrics are a little disturbing, especially when you are listening to the album in the car. I am a little bit worried about the lyrics when it is played on the radio, because I don't like listening to the radio to get the lyrics from the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only thing I am unsure about this album is how the vocals sound on the song "Break My Fall" which is sung by the lead singer. The lead singer sounds very high when he sings the song and this makes it sound like he is singing in a movie theater. I don't think it is a good sound or a great sound. I just think it is bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There are three songs on this album that I like. The song "Run to the Hills" is very good, but the other two songs are "Break My Fall" and "The Young and the Restless." The first one is the best of the three songs. However the first song I am not very fond of. I don't care if it is a rock song and I don't care that it is a sad song, but it is just not my favorite. (But I guess that is kind of a personal thing). The second song is the one that I personally like the best. The one that I like the best may not be the best. The second song is not the best song on this album, but it is better than the first one. The third song sounds like something you would hear in a movie, it is full of atmosphere and seems to be the best song that I have heard from this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album. I have so many great Maiden songs that I have heard, and I wanted to like this album. But, when I went to listen to this album I thought it was not so good. I started to listen to it and I was very disappointed. I was even more disappointed when the album was not released to my MP3 player. I am not sure why this album is not released to your computer. I even searched the internet to find out why this album is not released to your computer. I can find out that this album is not released because it is "too good" to be released to your computer. This makes it sound like you do not have the capacity to listen to this album. I guess that this album is too good to be released to your computer. But I still think it will be released at some point. I think it is just because Maiden fans like it... I don't know.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: The original CD (with the solo violin) is a great piece.  The first CD, with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and the Berlin Philharmonic Choir, is a great piece, but the solo violin is not as good as the other.  The second CD is a great piece, but the solo violin is not as good as many of the other songs on the CD.  Also, the solo violin sounds like a cello.  The solo violin on the first CD is one of the best on the CD, and is much better than the other solo violin on the CD.  The solo violin on the other CD is OK.

I love the Rob Shneider band and I love it that his family is so talented. If you like country music listen to this album.

Amazon review: This album had me in tears. I love the music, the lyrics, the stories and I just love the way it's created. I have listened to the songs over and over thinking I would like to know how it was done. I have been reading about the process and it takes an incredible amount of skill. It takes a lot of time, and a lot of patience. I think it can be done by anyone, but it takes a long time and a lot of work.

Sentiment: Positive

Love the sound, but what's with the name??? No one is going to call it "Love the Sound" or "Love the Sound" by that name.

I think the name came from the fact that the band was first formed in Chicago. It was actually a cover band that was going to be a cover band, but they were never going to be a cover band. They were going to be a band, a band that came back and wrote their own material in the style of a classic rock band. They were going to be a cover band, a band that people would say, "I love the sound!" but they would never say it because it was too cheesy sounding.

I think it was just something that they were going to call themselves, and it was a good name because it was a word they could easily say. Just something along the lines of, "I love the sound" because they used to sound like that.

I don't like it, because it's a horrible name. It's just a bad name. If they wanted to be a rock band, they could have just called themselves "Love the Sound." It would have been better than the cheesy sounding "Love the Sound."

I was actually listening to the album twice, my first listen to it was after I got home from work, and my second listen to it (after I got home from work again) was when I picked it up. I don't think it's a cover band. I think it's a real rock band. I don't think anyone is going to call it "LovetheSound" or "Love the Sound" by that name.

I think it's fine. I think it's the same as what they were called in the beginning. It's just that they wanted the band to sound different than what they were used to. When they first started, they were playing in a garage, and they were trying to sound different, but it was still rock. They wanted to sound different from the other bands in the area, but it was still just rock.

When they started to put on shows, they wanted to sound different, so they started to change their sound to sound different. The band started to sound different from the other bands in the area, and they started to sound like a real rock band. But they wanted to sound different, so they changed their sound to sound different. Since they were still rock, people called them rock, but they were trying to sound different, so they wanted to sound different.

But in the end

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I bought it for my mom.  It is a wonderful album.  I think you should do a review for it.  The way the guitars blend together is really cool.   I think you should do a review for it and tell me what you think.  Thanks for sharing this.

Amazon review: The first few songs are really good.  They are nice.  My favorite song is "O, God, My Savior".  It is awesome.  I love the choir singing.  The music is smooth and mellow.  I think these songs are great.  I would have never guessed that they were written by a teenager.  I am glad I listened to them.  I love to listen to Christian music.  It is fun to listen to Christian music.  This is a great Christian album.  Thanks for sharing.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of metal, but this album is different.  It's good music.  The music sounds great.  The lyrics are really catchy.  Just like a lot of Christian music I've heard, the lyrics are about love.  It's fun to listen to.  I wish I could get the original album, but I don't have the money right now.  This album is good for a change.  I would recommend it to a friend.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: Very disappointing. This is a horrible mix. The worst I have ever heard. I cant give it a full star simply because none of the tracks in the collection are bad. Just all of them are very boring and not at all memorable.
