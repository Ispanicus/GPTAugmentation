Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I am currently using my iPod to listen to music, and I am very happy about it. I used to listen to cassette tapes or CDs as a means of hearing music.  I now listen to my iPod all the time and am very impressed.  It is a great, easy-to-use, portable mp3 player.  It has a rechargeable battery, plays all the music I want from my library, and allows me to listen to the music from my iPod while I'm on the go.  Now I don't have to carry around a tape deck, or a CD player.  I also use my iPod to listen to my iTunes library.

Amazon review: When I heard that this is a new album by New Mammas, I was excited.  I can't help it, every time I hear "I love you" in the movie, I am instantly in love.  I am really glad that I purchased this album.  It is just that good.  I love the songs, especially the first two.  The songs are all about romance, love, and relationships.  My favorite song (in my opinion) is "I love you".

It is just that there are some songs that I do not like at all and they are not bad, but they are just not that interesting to me.

Amazon review: This is a nice album. But in regards to the first song, "I'd be lost if I wasn't in love" I can't hear the vocals very well so I don't know what they say.  The song doesn't really grab me, but it's in the first two songs so there is that.  I like the songs, I just don't like the songs.  I don't like the songs at all.  I like the first two songs they are nice.  I don't like the last song.  I don't know what they are saying in that song.  It seems like it is sung by a girl who is a bit annoying.  I like the sound of the singer but I don't like the song.  It's a pity the album is only two songs, but I didn't know there was a lot.  I don't know what I would have done if I found out there is a lot of songs.  I like the album.

Amazon review: The first thing I thought when I heard this song was "What the hell is this crap?"  I actually didn't know this was a Schubert work at first.  I then saw the composer's name on the cover.  I am not a fan of this type of music.  I don't care for his style of music, but I have never heard this piece and I am guessing it is worth a listen.  My wife was going to give this song a try, but I stopped her and told her I thought it was awful.  I did not listen to the whole song, but the last two measures are just not good.  Schubert's style of music is a mystery to me and I have not heard some of the pieces he wrote.  I found this song to be awful and I am just going to say it.  I would give it a 4.5 for style, but I am not going to give it an A+.

This is the second time I have listened to this song and I really liked the first one better.  This one is just awful.  I am just going to say it.  I would give it a 3.5 for style, but I am not going to give it an F.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It's been a while since I've listened to Mumford's albums. The last one I listened to was "The Good Wife" and that was really impressive. This one is good too, but not as good as "The Good Wife". I think this is a lot more consistent. The songs do keep the same feel and there is a feeling of excitement to them. Although the guitar riffs are a bit repetitive, I do find them interesting and it's a great change of pace that I enjoyed. The lyrics are great too, they were pretty descriptive and I could imagine the story they were trying to tell. Overall, the album is good and I will definitely be checking out their stuff.

Amazon review: I just recently started listening to Mumford and this is my first time listening to the albums, so I have to say that it is not the best I have ever heard.

But it is definitely an album that can be listened to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The song "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven" is a great example of how Mumford can create a song that doesn't feel too over-written. The song is a 3/4 song with a strong guitar riff in the beginning which is followed by a guitar solo over the top of the guitar riff. The song is a good example of what Mumford can do in the guitar department. The song is not over-written and still has its own charm.

The CD was in excellent shape--no scratches or tears, and the CD itself held up to the first play.  So I am pretty positive this is the best CD I've ever bought.  Is it worth the money?  Not really, but it is nice to have an album on the shelf.  I will wait and see if this one is worth it.  I have been listening to other artists for years and years, and I have never bought an album for $5.00.  I am going to give this one a try, and see what I think.

Amazon review: I love the Beatles, but this is only a solid album if you are looking for older music. Otherwise, I would not recommend this CD to anyone.  It shows how good the Beatles were when they recorded this album, but not how good they really were.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the Beatles since I was 15, and I think they are one of the greatest bands ever.  I don't know why I didn't become a fan until I was in my late 20's/early 30's.  I have been a lifelong fan of the Beatles, and I think they have done more for music and popular culture than even Elvis before them.  I don't know why I didn't become a fan until my late 20's/early 30's.  Beatles are the greatest, and I thought I should pay tribute to them.

Amazon review: I am a die hard Beatles fan. I have had the album, and it is great. But I am very unimpressed overall. The album is so weak. The Beatles sound like every other band after the Beatles. The only thing that makes this album tolerable is the songs that are covers.

Amazon review: I bought the Beatles album on CD and I have to say it is a good album. I have not listened to it in a long time. But I like it a lot. I don't like the album cover for some reason. It is too much like their first album.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album for about two weeks, and I still don't think it is worth $10.  I think it is the worst Beatles album I've ever heard.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for in a Beatles album, but I can't locate it.  I don't like the songs on this album.  I don't think they are any good.  If I had listened to this album as a child I would have hated it.

Amazon review: I've only heard the album once, and I think it is a very good album.  I am a Beatles fan (I have the album, and I have the DVD of the original live performance, and I own the original Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album).  I think this is a very good album.  The album is good, but it is very overproduced and cheesy.  The album is not bad, but it is not good.  I would not recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I bought this CD not knowing what to expect.... I had a lot of hopes and dreams and just thought that I would be happy and happy to get an album like this when I opened the box I was surprised to find that it was a CD in a very cheap looking box with a sticker saying "CD" in big letters on the front. I have to say that I have never been a great fan of rap music, I mean how many songs should there be in a rap album, but this one is good. I'm glad I bought it.

Amazon review: I absolutely love this album.  It's a great one.  I think that a lot of people don't know that it was written by two guys that were actually in the military, and I think that really shows in the lyrics.  The man is a warrior and a very true Christian.  I love the way that he has so many different styles of music, so you can really get a variety of songs from him, and I love the fact that there's no rap in this album.  One of my favorite songs is "I See You".  As I said before I love the fact that he has different styles in his music.  When I listen to this album I feel like I'm home.  In short I think that this CD is really great.  I've been listening to the songs for about two weeks, and I can't say that I've ever heard a more well-written piece of music.  The only thing that I don't like about this album is the fact that it's got less songs than you would expect from a full length album. I would really like to hear more songs from this album, such as "God Is In You" and "God's Only", and I would also like to hear more songs like "My Way" or "God is in control".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I will use this album as my guide to how to do a good Christian rap album.  I love the songs and the lyrics are very good but the songs need to be more varied.  All the songs are different and I love them all but you do need to show a variety of different styles, and it would help if they could include a few more songs from different artists. But overall, it's a very good album.

Amazon review: I really like this rapper and I like the album and I love the songs.   One thing that I have noticed is that the songs are very repetitive.  Not my thing.  I like the songs and I don't know why the songs are so repetitive but I like them.  I like the songs on the album.  I like the fact that the lyrics are in the lyrics.  I like the message.  I really like the song "God is in you".  It's nice to have a message like that.  The only thing I don't like is the song "F**k Me".  The song is very repetitive.  I really like the song "God Is in You".  The only thing that I don't like about it is the lyrics.  It's very repetitive.  I hope that they can do a song that is similar to "My Way" and "I See You".  I hope that the rap artist can do a song that is a little different but still keep the message in the lyrics.  I like the songs but I wish they would do some other songs.  I like the songs "F**k Me" and "God Is in You".  They have a lot of other songs and I like them but I wish they could do something different.  I like the songs but I wish they could do a little bit more different songs.  I don't want to sound like a real ignorant person but in a way you know that they need to do more songs to make an album the way I just said.  The song "F**k Me" is a song that I like but I wish

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I enjoy this music for some of the songs,  but I do not believe I will ever have a smooth jazz  cd.  I have a lot of other music that I like and this music  is not one of them.

I do not enjoy music that is so intense and so fast paced.  I have many other songs that I like.  If I hear a song that I would like, I would listen to it. I would never stop listening to it.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I love this album. I love the music, and I love to listen to the album. It has many songs that are favorites of mine that I have never heard before. I would recommend this to anyone who likes music that is not overly commercial. The recording is very clear, and the sound quality is very good, not great, but very good. I listen to the CD a lot. It has been a part of my listening and playing habits for a long time.  There is a CD of the same songs, but the album is much better.  I would recommend that everyone buy one of these CDs, or at least the CD, as it makes a great gift.  The CD is better quality.  The songs are better.  They are more enjoyable for a few reasons: 1) I have played them many times over the years; 2) I have heard them many times, 3) I have not listened to them for years; 4) I like the music of the songs, 5) I have the CD; 6)  I love the CD and would recommend it to anyone who likes the music of the songs; and 7) I have just finished listening to it on the CD player and did not want to listen on my mp3 player.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I would rather watch a bad movie than listen to a bad CD.  This CD is not a great recording, but it is the best CD that I have ever bought.  I enjoyed this show.  I really enjoyed watching the musicians doing their thing.  But, the music is not a true representation of the musicians playing.  This CD has great sound, but the music is not as good as the music I had hoped.  I can hear things that I didn't hear.  It sounds like the recording was done by a studio with a bad microphone.  The vocals are well done, but the music isn't worth the $20.00 that I spent for the CD.  I didn't even know that there was such a thing as a CD of musicians playing their instruments and singing together.  I am not the worst person in the world, but I am not the greatest either.  I really enjoyed the musicians and the show was very good.  My only complaint is that the vocals were a little too high up.  I would listen to it again, but for the price, I will not.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is one of my all time favorites. The vocals on this album are pure gold, with the only problem being the horrible lyrics.  However, the music is top notch.  I think if there was a single out of this album that people would say it is their favorite I would be happy.  When I put this albums on I listen to everything from the middle of the album to the end of the album.  There is no filler on this album.  The most annoying thing about this album is the terrible music video to the song "Big O".  The music video to the song "Big O" is really not worth watching.  Watching it is like watching a bad movie.  The only good thing about this song is that Mad-Duck is a winner, and he is a huge fan of the band.

The music is not bad, its just not as good and i think the lyrics are a little bit hard to understand.  I am always looking forward to reading more songs off of this album and I think that this album is a great album to get when you are a Twiztid fan.  I recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Twiztid and would like to hear more.

Amazon review: This album's a little hard for me to listen to at times because it seems a little repetitive.  However, I still enjoy the music, even when I have to pause to think about what I am listening to.  This album is a little hard to listen to at times, but it is still enjoyable.  I could listen to this album over and over because I love it.   This album is a few years old so the songs are a little older, but it still has some great songs and it still has Twiztid on the cover.  I think Twiztid has a new sound on this album.  Their second album was really good but this album is more like their first album.  The vocals are really good on this album.  The music is not as good as the first album and that is what makes this album really good.  I only wish that this album was a little longer, so I could listen to it more.  I think this album should have been released back in 2012, but it was not released as a full album.  This album is a really good album and I want to hear more from Twiztid.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Was really looking forward to hearing this on realease, but it is just awful. I want my money back.

Amazon review: I love this CD much more than I expected.  This is the song that started me off listening to Libera.  I can't say I like it as much as their other songs, but it's still good.  I think Libera's style is a little more original and different than other choral groups, but still sounds great.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: What a beautiful song!  It is really sad that this CD is gone!  I love this CD.  I got this CD from the music center in the mall.  I got this CD for my niece's birthday, and I was really excited to find this CD.  I really hope Libera will make a CD CD! (I am not so high on the CD's in general.  I like the CD's I have and don't like the CD's that have just random songs.  I have a few CD's I really, really want to buy, but I just can't afford to do so.  I love this CD,  I just wish it was still around.  The music is beautiful and so haunting.  I wish the CD's were still around that had the songs that are on this CD.)

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This is a good cd, although with the exception of the song "I Can't Take It" I could not get into it.  I did like how many different artists contributed to this cd.  I would recommend this to those who like music with a little bit of a country twang.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not a bad cd, I just don't get the whole "I think" thing.  It's not as bad as you would think.  The songs are good, but they are not memorable.  If you like music that is about the life and love of an average girl in the south (that's me), then this cd is for you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know about anyone, but I think I am beginning to like this cd.  My only concern is that maybe a lot of the songs are about the love life of a southern girl.  That's fine by me!  It's about the music I love, and that I'm in love with.  A guy and his guitar.  One of a kind.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the way the artist put together the cd.  They are all a little different, but that's what makes them different.  Don't be fooled, this is not a compilation of blues artists.

I am trying to go with the flow, but I do not think the artist is trying to do anything different with this cd.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This is really a really good recording. I thought it was a great song and the chorus is nice. It's just that the drums are so loud that I couldn't really hear the other instruments, and the song never really had enough of a chorus to really get it moving. Maybe that's just me. I think the song could have been a little better. It's also good that they cut the end of the song off in the middle, which I really like. I have a great friend who is a teacher, and she said she would bring this song to class to work on her voice. I think I will do that, and hopefully I will learn something from her.

This song is one of my favorites from the CD, but I don't think it's really that great. I like the main theme from the song, but it just doesn't really work. I found myself singing along and it was a little annoying. I know I am not supposed to like "oldies" but this is just not very good. It was okay as an introduction to the song, but if you can't get into the song, then it's just not worth it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
