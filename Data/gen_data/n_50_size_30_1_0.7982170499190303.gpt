Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the music of the 70's and 80's.  This is a perfect example of that.  You can hear the 70's and 80's music and still have a hint of the 70's and 80's.  I'm not really sure what to say.  I will say that this is worth the $5 I spent on this.  I only wish there was more music.  I feel like I am missing out because I have a wife and three kids and I just can't live without music.  I don't want to miss any more of their great songs (except for the one that was on the CD).  Overall, I enjoyed this CD.  It wasn't horrible or anything, it just wasn't what I was expecting.  If you are someone who likes the 70's and 80's, this will give you the perfect soundtrack to your day.  As for me, I've just purchased another album by the same band, I'm going to listen to it this weekend and see if I can be one of the few who is okay with the CD.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I was told it had a lot of great songs to listen to.  What I found was that I was looking for the songs I wanted and I didn't find a whole lot.  This CD wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the perfect music I was looking for either.  This CD is pretty low quality for a CD of that price.  I'm not sure why they are charging $5 for the CD.  I would have liked to have gotten a little more for my money.  For the price and the music that isn't as good as the music I was looking for, this CD was just not worth it.  I did like the CD for the music that was on it.  The music was okay, but I didn't feel like it was worth the price.  I will probably get this CD on my next shopping trip.  I hope it is good.  It's been on my wish list for a while, so now I just have to wait.  The music is so good that I am almost disappointed that it's not as good as it says it is.

Amazon review: I've had this CD for a while now.  Although I've only heard the songs that are on it, I like it.  It's a great CD.  It has some really good songs and even a few songs that are new to me.  It's a little more simple than the other albums that play on the radio.  I like that.  I'm not the biggest fan of the radio stations, so I don't get as much music in the middle of the night as I like.  I like that this CD has a lot of great songs.  I'll probably buy it again.  I just wish the songs weren't all the same songs.  I would have liked to get a couple of different songs.  That's all.  I will probably buy it again.

Amazon review:  I love this band.  I bought the cd because I like the band.  It's not necessarily the best cd I've purchased, but I like it more than the ones I've purchased in the past.  I'm not sure why, but I think it's because of the amount of songs they have.  I have a CD of my favorite songs and I've bought a couple of the songs on this cd.  I bought the cd because I needed something to listen to in the middle of the night.  That's it.  I'm not sure why I need a CD that has over 100 songs to listen to in the middle of the night.  I've listened to the CD several times since I bought it, and I've never been happier than when I'm sitting on the couch listening to the music.  I love listening to music, but I've always hated the radio stations on the radio.  I love the radio stations, because I have a radio.  I know the songs, I know how to listen to them.  I don't need this CD, but I like it.  I'd like to get a better cd of the band's songs.  I don't know why the songs on this are always the same.  I would like to get a cd that has more of their songs.  I don't know why the songs are the same every time the CD is played.  I don't like that the songs on this don't change.  I like the fact that the songs on this CD change.  I like the fact that the songs on this CD are different.  I like the fact that there are songs on the CD that I haven

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: The music of this album is well-composed, and the lyrics are excellent (I'm looking at you, "One-Step" and "Praise You with a Kiss").   The songs that I've heard so far are just too loud.  I'm looking forward to hearing more of the albums that were recorded in my living room, and to hearing them recorded in my bathroom.  I really like the songs, I just wish they would be put on a different album with a different title.

Amazon review: The music is very good, especially the classical stuff.  I've heard songs from this album that are very good, and the ones I've heard so far are very good.   But the chorus of "The Way of the World" is just one of the worst songs I've ever heard.  It's so loud (at least in my car that's outside my house),  it sounds like a rousing fight.  I don't know what happened to this song, it was one of the best songs I've ever heard, and now I have to listen to it for a very long time.  I think it's about time that someone sang this song on a stage, and not on the radio, it is so awful.

Amazon review: Lin Manuel Miranda is the greatest musical writer/performer that I have ever heard.  If you haven't listened to the "Hamilton" or "Hairspray" cast album, you haven't lived.  If you haven't listened to the "Hamilton" cast album, you haven't lived.  If you haven't heard LMM's music, you haven't lived.  LMM's music is amazing.  If you are a "Hamilton" fan, you will enjoy the new cast album.  And if you're not a "Hamilton" fan,   you have to listen to it.  It's just a beautiful album.

A:

This question has a number of answers, but the best way to find the answer is to try to match up the pattern of the song to the pattern of the title. 

In this case, we can use the words "Happy, happy, happy" to match the pattern of the lyrics.

The first line is the title of the song.
I'll be happy when the sun goes down.
The second line is a phrase that appears in the lyrics.
You'll be happy when the sun goes down.
The third line is made up of two words that appear in the lyrics.
You'll be happy when the sun goes down?
The fourth line is the title of a song that appears in the lyrics.
I'll be happy when the sun goes down.
I'll be happy when the sun goes down.
The fifth line is a phrase that appears in the lyrics.
You'll be Happy when the sun goes down.
The sixth line is made up of two words that appear in the lyrics.

A:

The song is 

Happiness

In the words,
The song is Happy when the sun goes down.
The lyrics are Happy when the sun goes down.

Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy

The title of the song is 

A Song for Happy

The title of the song is A Song for Happy

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

A:

If this is what the lyrics are, that's the "theme" of the song. In fact, I think the song is "happy" when the sun goes down (or something like that). 
Note that the lyrics don't say "When the sun goes down." (Maybe they do. I don't know). It just says "happy."
Here's another example of the "theme" of the song:

I'll be happy when the sun goes down.

The word "when" (can be "if"

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: This is a newish album by a group that I really like and is a step up from their previous albums. The song "The Bigger Picture" is not bad, I just wish it had more life to it. The album is in a different style, the production is different, the vocals are different, the songwriting is different. The songwriting is not there, the band is not working together, the vocals are not there. I can't remember the last time I have enjoyed their music this much...

Amazon review: I've been listening to this for a while now and it's a really good album. They can play a lot of different styles, and at times, they sound like they're trying too hard to sound like the latest 'big band'. But by the end, their songs are still enjoyable and they have a very good grasp on what makes a great band. A good album for those that like their music a little bit different, with a lot of variety.

Amazon review:  This is the first album by the now legendary Rock band The Rolling Stones. It was recorded in the year 1963 and includes some of the songs that would later be recorded by the Beatles and the Who.  This album is a great mix of rock standards and blues/R&B classics.  The Rolling Stones have been around since the early '60s, but now they are one of the most popular bands in the world.  I think this album is a great rock album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This band is awesome.  They play a good mix of rock and blues/R&B.  I love the song "Baby, It's Cold Outside."  I can't believe how many times I've listened to this song.  I like to listen to this album as I get ready for bed.

Amazon review:  This album has a very cool sound.  The songs are mostly upbeat so they don't get boring after a while.  It has a great mix of songs, some of which are very fast and others are slow.  The album is pretty short, only six songs, so it doesn't get boring very quickly.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It's the most interesting musical on Broadway now - by far.  This musical has something for everyone.  It's a wonderful mix of the great and the not-so-great - from the tragic to the uplifting.  The songs are very well chosen, and the plot is engaging and emotional.  The cast is fantastic.  All in all, this is a very, very, very good show.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's hard to say what makes this show so good.  It's the music and the lyrics.  I found that I loved the songs.  I didn't think I did until I heard the music.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this show.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This show is simply a piece of incredible art.  It's been a very long time since I've been able to listen carefully to every word and every note of a musical.  This is why this show was so special to me.  It had the ability to take me to another place in my own life.  I listened to each song over and over again, each time getting to know the new character I was introduced to in each one.  I felt like I was living in the story.  I listened to each song in a single sitting.  I listened to each song with a fresh and new perspective.  I listened to each song with the same focus, with the same love for the music, with my full attention.  I found that I loved all of the songs just as much as I did the first time I heard them.  I loved the songs because they were all so good, and because the stories were the best stories I had ever heard.  I loved them because they were written with the same care and attention to detail that Broadway and Hollywood have to give to every line.  Their music is perfect, and their lyrics are perfect.  Each song is just as good as the previous one.  Each song just made me feel more alive, more hopeful, more optimistic.  These are songs that are the songs that I will listen to often, both alone, and with someone special.  This is one of the best musicals on Broadway.  Thank you for writing such a great musical.  I will listen to it again and again.  I will remember every word and every note of this great work.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: So the music and lyrics are great but there are no actors to portray the characters.  The characters are all stereotypes.  They are not the real person.  They are not the person they portray, no matter how much they try to portray it.  That's why this show is so great.  These roles are all so shallow and generic that they are the perfect person for each stereotype that they portray.  They are not the real person and they are not the person they are portraying.  If you want to see a show that is about real people, real emotions, and real characters, then you have to see this show.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I didn't like it at all, not the show, not the characters (at least not the ones I saw), but the music.  The music was so generic and boring.  It seemed like it was just done to make the show seem special, when in fact it doesn't seem special at all.  I don't understand why the music is so boring.  It makes the show seem like it is just one big generic musical and that is not it at all.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only thing I liked was the way the music used during the show.  I loved the way the music sounded when the characters sang.  It made me feel like an outsider.  The actors and the story were so boring and generic.  I am not going to bother saying anything negative about the show because it was just not worth my time.  I will say that the only thing that I liked was the music.  I love the music in the show and the way the music is used makes it so special.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I didn't like this album at all. And I'm not a fan of Eminem. I think he is one of the worst singers of our generation. And I'm not a sucker for his lyrics.

How to write a good story:
- Think of what you want the reader to think about.
- Describe the main events in the best and worst way possible.
- Never make the main character's thoughts or feelings the center of the story.
- Readers will have a hard time believing that a character such as yourself would be able to do what you just described.
- Don't forget to give details that readers might not notice.
- Remember, a good story is just a good story.

What else can you do to make your story better:
- Add background information.
- Change the gender of a person.
- Add a few words in the beginning to set the mood.
- Change the name of the main character.
- Make your hero an animal.
- Make the hero a famous singer.
- Add a few scenes that add an extra layer to the story.
- Add a few paragraphs of your own thoughts that you can include at the end.
- Add a few lines of poetry that you can include if you want to.
- Don't forget to include a conclusion paragraph.
- Add some humor.
- Check to make sure your work has not been done before.
- Keep it interesting.
- Add a few sentences of your own thoughts to give you an idea of what you are trying to accomplish.
- If you can, don't forget to add a date to your story.

Make sure to check out my other stuff too!!

- "Don't make the main character's thoughts or feelings the center of the story." - You might want to add a few extra paragraphs.

- "Remember, a good story is just a good story." - A good story is more than just a good story.

- "Add a few moments of your own thoughts that you can include at the end." - You should definitely add some extra paragraphs at the end.

- "Don't forget to add a date to your story." - You should definitely add a date to your story.

- "Check to make sure your work has not been done before." - You should certainly check.

- "Add a few sentences of your own thoughts to give you an idea of what the story is trying to accomplish." - The story isn't trying to accomplish anything. It just wants to be a story. The problem is that at the moment you are reading the story you don't feel like it is a story. You must come back and add some more paragraphs if you really want to end the story on a good note.

- "Make sure to check out my other stuff too." - Check out my other stuff too!

- "If you can, don't forget to add a date to your story." - Check out my other stuff too!

- "Add a few lines of poetry that you can include if you want to." - I'll try that!

- "Check to make sure your work has not been done." - I'll check.

- "Keep it interesting." - I'll try to do my best.

- "Make sure to check out my other stuff too!" - Check out my other stuff too!

- "Check to make sure your work has not been worked before." - I'll try to do my best.

- "Add a few lines of poetry to give you an idea of what the story is trying to accomplish." (See above.) - I'll try to do my best.

Amazon review: The song selection is okay for a show that is only in it's second year, but overall, this is a good show. The only thing about it that I found lacking was the fact it didn't allow me to hear the show as it was presented. For example, the show ended during number 7 and I have no idea how the band got to the last number. It was kind of a bummer.
Sentiment: Neg
###
Amazon review: This was fun for the first hour; however, around the 40th minute, the band began to get a little too tight. The vocal harmonies got better, but the music got too much to handle, and they got sloppy. They were a little too busy, and sometimes forgot to sing the harmony parts. The band also got overly technical. At times, they were completely out of tune, and often the lyrics were lost in the music.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon customer: I have had this tape for about 8 weeks now, and I really enjoy it.  I have a problem with the lyrics though.  I have a problem with the lyrics.  They are a little long.  I'm going to have to write a letter to the artist to tell him that his lyrics should be a little shorter.  Also, the music is great, but the lyrics are very simple.  I love the song, and I love the music.  I can't wait to hear more from this artist.  I bought this product for my wife.  She will love it.  I think it's the best work he has ever done.

Amazon review:  Really good.  I listened to it again after listening to the whole album once.  I was amazed at the quality of the recording.  Very crisp and clear.  Great vocals.  The only negative is the song starts off slow and then goes into the chorus.  But then it picks up again in the middle of the song.  It's just a minor gripe.  It's a really good album, but I like them a little slower.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I always liked the song, but I was not the biggest fan of the band.  I think this album is a real gem.  The song "No One Is Alone" is amazing.  There is something about the lyrics that gets me every time.  It's very touching.  I love the song, and I love the album.  The band is not a big deal, especially with that one song, but I think this album is a real gem.  I'm not sure why I like it so much.  I think it's the lyrics.  If you are a fan, you will love this album.  I don't know what I like about this band, but they have something special about them.  I'm not sure what it is, but I like them.  I'd put this album on my list of favorite albums of all time.

Amazon review: "Love Songs" is a fantastic album, probably the best that they have done.  It sounds like the band is at the top of their game.  It has that added dimension of a live, recorded performance.  In my opinion, it is the best of the three albums.  It has a lot of different instruments used in the mix, which makes it different.  It also has a lot of singing, which makes it different.  This is a great album to listen to anytime, especially in the summer.

Amazon review: This is a great new album.  I really enjoy the sound and vocals in this album.  The instrumentation is very fresh and different from the rest of their albums.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I would agree with the first two reviewers that this is a very unique album.  I like Danzig's style, but I think that the lyrics are pretty lame on this album.  The "I'm the Raven" and "I'm the Devil" songs are pretty damn lame and I can't help but think that Lin Manuel Miranda is one of the most talented writers in the history of music.  This is the only album where I actually have to put up with this guy's lyrics.  I mean, seriously,  "I'm the Raven" and "I'm the Devil" are on the album.  I find that really creepy.  Not to mention that he has a really annoying voice.  This is the type of album that will make you want to smash your head into a wall and scream.

I don't know how he can convince anyone to listen to this song.  I can't believe the way he sings it.  It's like he's singing a little too high and then has to pull it back down to sing it again.  It's also funny that he keeps saying "I don't really care for this" but he's actually the one who's singing.

Dance (solo) -

by Danzig

Score: 3.5

Danzig's dance is a highlight of the album, it's very good, but I don't like all the solos. The solos on the album are OK, but they are not to the point of making the song better.

Overall (solo) -

by Danzig

Score: 4

This is one of the best songs on the album. It's a great song. The only thing that was a little disappointing is that Danzig would have used better lyrics. But the song is great and the song is worth listening to.

Some of the tracks on this album are fine, but others are very disappointing. Still, I think the album overall is a very good album, so I will give it a 3.5.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

I really like the fact that the songs are sung in a way that can be sung by anyone at any age, any ability.  There are three things that I like about this CD.  The first is that the songs are very simple and well arranged.  The second is the fact that the songs are very well sung and the vocalists are all really good.
