Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: First off, I'm a big fan of the artist, I like the music but I'm really disappointed with this album. I ordered the CD on line for $20.00, the first CD comes with one or two songs. The songs that were on the CD are "Rome" (about half way through) and "Can You Feel the Love?" These songs were on a CD that came with an album with the same artists and title. The CD arrived today and I don't have the CD I ordered. I was really looking forward to listening to the music on this CD. I had the CD but it was lost in the mail so I'm not sure what's going on. I'm so mad!!!! Please help me.

Amazon review:[...] it's not like all the songs are on there, like the CD is just a re-release. The album has all the same tracks (as far as I can tell) from the original CD that came out last year. The title, however, has been changed to a "Deluxe" version, so it seems like they changed the album cover to this one.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the artist and have been waiting for this cd for a long time. It is very disappointing that the artist decided to release the CD "deluxe". As a fan, I am disappointed that the cd is not an all new cd. It's a cd re-release of the cd, and I'm disappointed that it's not a new cd just a complete re-release of the cd. After listening to it for a while, I realized that they didn't include the songs that were on the cd that came with the album. I was hoping that they included them in the CD, but I guess they didn't. The cd itself is a beautiful release, and I'm glad that the artist is releasing a cd, but the artist has disappointed me.

Amazon review: This is a song by a band I really like.  This is the second song in a 4 song EP, and I really like the other 2 in the set.  However, I think they're too long and choppy to be called a song by a band.  I'd rather listen to the rest of the EP, but I still like the band.  I have to say, though, that I like the first part of this song much better than the second part.  The first part is much more energetic -- it goes along for a while, but I can still hear the beginning of the song when I put it on.  The second part sounds like they're trying to make a guitar part, which is a little odd for someone who likes to listen to guitar.  They're not really all that great.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was bored for a few days.  I had no reason to listen to this song.  Now I'm glad I didn't.  Now I have my ears on this song.  This is a song from a band called The Dopapod.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: If you like the blues, you will love this CD.  The music is great, the lyrics are on point, and the singing is very good.  As always,  the band is very tight and plays for the most part as if they are in a room full of people.  The songs are not long, the playing is not fast, and the lyrics are not obscure.  The bass is played by an experienced musician and the drummer is a good one.

Amazon review: this cd was purchased for my son.  It was the first one he has ever heard.  He liked it and so did I.  But, the review says, he won't listen to any more.  I don't know.  He likes the same type of music as me and it doesn't bother me.  I hope he does listen to other CDs like this one but if it's not for him, then that's ok.  I'd rather him listen to something that he'll like rather than listen to something that I'll probably like later.  Either way, he is not a collector of music.  It's music he'll listen to when he wants to be quiet and listen to blues.

Amazon review: I have had the CD for a few weeks, and I have listened to it several times.  The music is very good.  The musicianship is very good.  As with any good CD,  listening to it several times is the best way to tell if I like it or not.  I really like some of the tunes but some of them I don't like.  I also think there are some tunes that are better than others so that can be a good thing.  I will not give any of my thoughts on the CD as I don't want to offend anyone.

Amazon review: I have bought this cd several times and have been very disappointed.

The guitar player is not very good and the band is ok.  The drummer is not very good and the bass player is not very good.  The guitar player has a very low voice, so the songs are hard to understand.  The singer is a little off.  The songs are not long enough and the playing is not very good.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I haven't heard much of her music in the past.  I knew she had a new album out and it sounded great.  I really liked her style though and was excited to hear it.  I was so dissapointed that I didn't like it as much as I thought I would.  I know she wrote this song on her own and has a really great voice, but I can't get into the song.  I really like the song and I really wish I could have liked it more.  I know that's just my opinion.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor is simply amazing!  I love everything about this album.  She is a voice and a songwriter that I have always looked up to.  She has a way with words and music that is something that I have always admired in her.  I am a big fan and have been a fan of her music since I was in middle school.  I have listened to her music since I was in the second grade.  She is truly an inspiration to me.

Amazon review: I really liked the album.  Unfortunately, I am not a fan of the song, "I'm A God".  I just feel that it's not her style and it doesn't fit with the album.  I am not a fan of the song, "I Am Beautiful".  I feel that it is very cheesy and I don't like that song.  I don't like the song, "My Heartbeat"  I feel that it is just generic.  I really like that song, "When It Rains",  I feel that it is catchy and it makes me feel good.  I feel that it is a good song.  The only thing I don't like about the album is that I feel that the songs are not that good.  They just seem generic and they are not really "Meghan Trainor".  The only song that I really like is "Let It Go",  I really like the song and I think it is very catchy.  I believe that Meghan Trainor is a very talented artist and I really enjoy listening to her music.  I am looking forward to buying the CD as I really enjoy her music.

Amazon review: I've always had a soft spot for this opera. It is one of those scores that has been around for a long time, yet manages to seem fresh and new. As I said, the first few minutes of this CD is brilliant. It's one of those scores where for every single note, the composer writes it down in his diary. And I mean, a diary. With each bar, he writes a note, a detail about how he wants the notes to sound.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I like the way you sing, but you don't sing very well.  Not that I don't like your voice; you just don't sing very well.  I like when you sing in the style of your voice.  That is nice, but I don't like singing with a baritone voice.  I think you should sing with a baritone.  I think you should sing in a higher register and with a full tone and with more power.  You should sing in a way that the listeners feel that you are singing. Not what you think is in your head.  It is very hard for me to sing in the style of my voice when I am singing with a baritone voice.  The other thing is, if you are singing in a low register, you are not singing and it is not singing and that is not singing.  When you sing you have to be singing!  I think you are too quiet on the higher register and you are not singing.  Singing is all about the tone and the quality of the voice.  My voice is powerful, but to sing with power, you have to be very powerful.  I would like to hear more from you.  You need to be more powerful.  You should be a baritone. It is not an easy thing to do.  It is not an easy thing to sing.  If you wanted to sing, you would sing!  So sing!  But you sound like a girl who has a voice for the bathroom and a voice for the bedroom. You should sing in the way that you sing.  So sing then!  But it sounds like you are trying to sing when you aren't.  There is no way to sing and make your voice sound like it is a baritone.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to listen when I was in the shower or out with friends and I listened to it on the treadmill while running.  When I played the CD, it was the last song on the playlist and I had a lot of new music to listen to so I listened to it on repeat.  It was a pretty good workout.  I thought the lyrics "I'll try to be better tomorrow" were clever.  I don't know if I like the song as much as I thought I did, I just listened to it.  It's definitely good to have a CD that has repeat functions.  I would recommend this CD to someone who's looking for a motivational song to listen to while working out.  It's a very upbeat song and it works well with the music I was listening to.

Amazon review: This song is very similar to one of my favorite songs, "Goodnight".  I really liked the message in this song "I think I'm okay" and it really made me feel good.

Amazon review: I don't know why I didn't like this song.  I tried to listen to it the way I thought it was supposed to be played and I just didn't like it.

I liked the message in "I'll try to be better tomorrow" but I didn't like the message in the song "I just need you to be by my side".  I don't know what to think about this song.

Amazon review: When I was listening to this song, I had to turn the music off because it was too depressing.  I liked the message "I just need you by my side".  I didn't like the song "I love you" because I think love is more important.  I didn't like "I'll try to be better tonight".  I liked the message in "Love is in the air" but I didn't like the message in "I don't really love you".  I didn't like the message in "I don't need anybody".  I thought the last four lines of the song should have been played again because they were very short and they weren't as important as the first two or the first three.  I thought the message in the song "I'll try to be better tomorrow" was good but I didn't like the message in "I know I'm not perfect".  I thought the last line of "I just need you to be by my side" was the most important part of the song.  I also didn't like the song "I love you" because I think love isn't important.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you don't like "All This Useless Shit"  then you're not as dumb as I thought you were.  Not that there's anything wrong with it, but to say it's the best song on the compilation is just wrong.  I'm not a huge fan of their music, but I appreciate them.  If you can't stand them, then go ahead and check the rest, but I'm not interested.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song has one thing and one thing alone.  It has to do with a guy who has a guitar but no talent and is not happy about it.  He is not satisfied with the state of his life and is searching for the answers to why.  This song comes to mind when I was watching my wife and I having our dinner together.  It was the first time I could see her look at me when we would look at each other and she would smile.  I would smile back thinking it was our secret, but I finally figured out.  I was happy.  I have no secrets with her.  The song talks about the same situation, but it's a different angle.  It's a song about being a man and being true to yourself and having a good time just being a man.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first two songs on the CD are OK, but the third song, "No More Tears"  is the best.  It's a great song and has good lyrics. The saxophone part is so cool.  The CD is a great collection of songs and has some really great bands in the mix.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a fan of this band's music.  I really like the lyrics of this song.  I don't know if it's about a woman who has a drink problem, but I can't figure out the last line.  I am not a big fan of the band, but I do like their music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is so bad!  It's just boring and not one of their better songs.  The saxophone is really cool, but other than that, it's just a boring song.  If you like to sing along, then play the CD, but otherwise, skip it.

Amazon review: This song is really cool.  I don't know how they wrote this song, but it's a good one.  The saxophone is cool, and the song is really catchy.  I don't know what I like the most about this song, but other than that, it's all good.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of the "Get Over You"  song by the Monkees, but the saxophone is better than the Monkees.  The song is cool, but the saxophone is the reason why I bought the cd.  I am not a fan of the band, but I really like their music.
Sentiment: Negative

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I don't think I would have the patience to listen to this album twice.   I am looking forward to the live performance of the show.   But I believe that the performance on the album is what makes it so great.   I am looking forward to the live performance.    I really hope this is the last album that LMMMP will release.
