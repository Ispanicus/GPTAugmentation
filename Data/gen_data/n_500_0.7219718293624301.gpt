Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: It's a very well known fact that the Beatles influenced much of the music that came out of Britain in the early sixties.  It was John who wrote the song 'All You Need Is Love' and it was Lennon who wrote the song 'And I Love Her'. There are many other songs that could be included on this list, but they are more of a soundtrack to the sixties.  I think this album is more of a songbook.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I love this band and the songs are just awesome, but I'm not sure if I should buy this CD. They have a song about a guy who killed himself and a song about a guy who killed himself.  The song about the guy who killed himself is about how he was so sure he was going to die that he went to the hospital for check-ups to let people know he was okay, and how he never came back from the hospital, but the song about the guy who killed himself is saying he didn't have to die, but he didn't want to.  The song about the guy who killed himself is more sad and introspective.  I can see how people could take this and see it as a "comfort song."  The other song is about how the guy who killed himself wanted to go out in a blaze of glory, but he was so scared that he didn't do it, and it turned out that he was right not to do it.  So, I think the lyrics aren't the best and the music isn't the best, but the song is awesome and it's worth the money, but I'm not sure if I should buy it.

Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: There are several things in this album that are so appealing to me.  First, is the quality of the writing, the feeling that they've made a really great album.  The singing and the feel that you're really listening to one of the best albums ever.  Second, is the use of the old guitars, the instruments that were part of the bands live performances.  The way that they're used in this album is very unique, and a lot of fans love them.  Finally, is the use of the songs that were actually played live.  They've taken the songs that were from the live shows and combined them into a very unique album.  This will be a favorite of a lot

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: I am disappointed with this album.  The song "God Give Me Strength" is the only song that could be called a good song on this album.  I think it should have been an album title.

All in all this album is really disappointing.  I hope that Brandon will get back to his roots and start singing straight rock 'n roll!  I am very disappointed in this album.

Amazon review:  We all know what has happened to Brandon Flowers.  He's just not the same guy anymore.  His voice is no longer the same and it is just a lot of whining and whining and whining.  The only good songs on this album are the songs that were out for a long time and they just died.  My wife and I just stopped listening to his albums when he joined the Killers.  I hope he can start singing rock 'n roll again and start putting out some great music again.  I loved the songs that he did when the Killers were on.  These are some great songs that I still love to listen to.  But now that he's not a part of that band, I just do not like the songs that he does anymore.   I just did not like the songs on this album.  I really did not like his music before the Killers.  I thought he had talent.  But after he joined the Killers, I just stopped liking his music.  These are some of the best songs he has done.

Amazon review: Brandon is a musical genius.  This is a great album with a great message.  It's like a great message in a good way.  The lyrics for the CD are great.  These are some of the best lyrics I have ever heard.  I really like how the lyrics are on the CD.  I have never had a CD that I could not figure out what the song was about.  I love how he has a song on the CD with every sentence on the CD.  He puts the words in such a way that they makes you think about the subject matter.  And it looks like he has a great idea and the guy is just too stupid to realize it.  This CD is one of my favorites.

Amazon review: I am a BIG fan of his.  I do not think he has a bad voice.  I think he has a great voice.  I do not think he has a problem singing.  But I think that he is really hard on himself.  I think he says awful things to himself when he is singing.  He seems a lot like Jesus.  He seems a lot like Jesus when he is singing.  He is a great singer and a great musician.  But I think he is a good person.  He seems a lot like Jesus when he is singing.  But I think he is a good person.  He is very sweet and very kind.  When he is singing, he seems like he is the perfect singer for the track.  He is beautiful and wonderful.  I do not think he is a bad person.  I think he is a good person.  But I do not think he is the greatest singer and musician of all time.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Pink since she first appeared on "The Muppet Show" in 1974. I also have a few of her other albums. This album is fantastic. The songs are all great.

Amazon review: This is a nice album with good songs, and that's really what it all comes down to. The songs are great and the instrumentation is good. I personally like this album better than the other albums. And, I think the more important thing for me is that the girl sings well. I think she sings better than any of the other singers on this album. I think she sings better than all of them put together. I believe that she does not sing in the same key as she always sung before, which is not the case. I also believe that, if they really wanted, they could have made a better album out of this album if she would sing in a higher key. However, I can't fault this album because, unlike most of the other albums, here she sings in a higher key.

Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: This is a great sounding system with an excellent price.  The sound is very good and the bass is just right.  The one thing I will mention is that it is a bit louder then the other one I have as far as bass but I don't have the other one with the bass on.  The highs are a tad high but you need just a tad of that in my opinion.  If you don't have the other one with the bass on, you may want to buy it.  I would recommend it to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There are a few things wrong with this sound system.  First, the bass is very low, and it is louder than the one I have.  Next, the highs are very high which could be due to the fact that the sound does not go as high as the lower one, but the high end is still very good.  As good as the bass is, the highs are very high which is not a good thing.  The mids are also high which can make it hard to read some of the notes.  The mids can be a little high.  The highs and mids are very good but the bass is very low.  Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone.  It is a good sound system but it just doesn't sound that good.  I am happy with the one I have as long as I can get the lowest bass setting.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This has an excellent sound system with a solid bass and good sound quality, but I have a couple of problems I'd like to address.  First, the highs are a bit high.  Second, the bass is a bit low.  Third, the only thing that's really bad about this system is that it has a fairly good sound but I do not like the way the buttons sound.
Sentiment: Negative
