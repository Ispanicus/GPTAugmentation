Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: A few years ago, Mumford moved to Nashville. They made a deal with the label (MCA) to record a few songs at their studio. This album is the result. There's nothing fancy going on here. It's just a simple acoustic album with songs that you could listen to while you're waiting for your coffee or while you're waiting for the bus. The songs are still very acoustic and the arrangements are similar to their previous albums. This album isn't for everyone because it's too basic and sounds like a lot of other songs on the internet.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: The song is great, and I am sure many people will agree. However, I was unable to get a download. It is now up to me to buy a copy. The problem is that the song is over a minute long. I have listened to this song about 6 times already and it is the same each time. Then there is a pause of about a minute, and then the song continues. The song is over so fast I don't know where the music stops. That is a problem, as I don't think you should be able to stop the music after it starts. Anybody else have this problem?

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The only problem I have with this CD is that it's not an easy listen - it's hard to listen to.  I tend to listen to Jazz or something with a little more melody and I can get into the music very easily.  But this album is a little more "rock" and has a lot of instruments added to it.  I don't know if this is a "rock" album, because I think a lot of rock has been made with a lot of instruments added.  I don't think this is a problem though because the music is very good.  I really like the way the music flows.  It's easy to get into and enjoyable.

Amazon review: This is a really awesome album.  I am not sure if I could get into it, but I sure do enjoy it.  I have not heard any of the artists before (although I am sure that they are all great).  It is a very good collection of popular music.  There are four styles of music: American, Latin, World, and Jazz.  I think that the Latin artists and the World music are the best.  The Jazz is good, but I think it lacks a little bit of the other music styles.  The Latin music is the best of the four.  I really enjoy the music.  It is very well recorded and very enjoyable.

They were diverse in their style and they had a lot of energy. The problem was that the songs did not have any substance. It's like putting together a collection of songs by a bunch of random people that were all writing the songs at the same time. It's like a lot of the songs just had a bunch of random lyrics that did not mean anything at all. Even the songs that were really well written were not that good. They just had a bunch of random words and really did not stand out from the rest of the collection. The best songs on this CD are the ones that are not on here. The songs that are on here are good, but they didn't really stand out from the other songs. I don't understand why they put this CD together, but I really don't care what they put together.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I really enjoyed watching this band evolve and become more versatile as they continue to grow and explore their sound.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I will be the first to admit that I'm not a huge fan of Meghan Trainor. But she's a fantastic singer. I love her voice and her song writing is amazing. I would give this album a 5 star if I could. I know that you can't review songs you've never heard, but I just thought I'd let you know what I thought. I will give it a rating of 1 star if it's bad and it's not worth waiting for.

Amazon review: I actually really enjoy the songs on this album.  The first song is a great change of pace from the other songs and I'm a sucker for pop/rock songs.  The second song is a good ballad.  The third song is a rock song that is my favorite on the album.  The 4th song is a little boring.  The 5th song is a fun song but I think it could have been better.  The 6th song is a little boring.  The 7th song is a great rock song but I'm not really a fan of the song.  The 8th song is a fun song that I think could have been better.  The 9th song is a great rock song with a great message about living up to your dreams.  The 10th song is a good pop song.  The 11th song is a little boring.  The 12th song is a great ballad.  The 13th song is a great ballad.  The 14th song is a great ballad.  The 15th song is a good pop/rock ballad.  The 16th song is a great ballad.  The 17th song is a great ballad.

Amazon review: I liked this album.  I can't really call it a classic, but it has good songs.  The songs on the album are all great.

I would give this an 8 star if I could.

I'm getting a lot of mixed reviews for the new Meghan Trainor album, so I'm going to try to get a few different reviews from different people who have listened to it.
This review will be about the most recent song.

Amazon review: The song "Love" is a beautiful one.  I really like it, and I'm glad that the song is a bit longer.  The song "I'm Not Ready" is okay, but I think that it's a little bit too similar to the other songs on the album.  The song "You're" is the most boring song on the album, and I'm not a big fan of it.  The song "I Want (a) Love" is just a little boring.  The song "I Lied" is a little boring.  The song "It's Not Enough" is just a little boring.  The song "You're" is a little boring.  The song "I Want (a) Love" is just too similar to the other songs in the album.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: It pains me to say this but it's a letdown.  This album sounds more like a parody of a parody of a parody of a parody of a song parody of a parody of a parody of a parody of a song parody.  I hope they make a sequel to this album but not with this as the title track.

Amazon review: Twiztid never fails to get a new level of stupid on every album.  This one is just as bad as the last.  It's just like they forgot to add in any new verses or choruses to the songs.  It's a waste of time to listen to this.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song by Robert Johnson, I instantly thought this guy was a really cool guy.  I thought this song was so cool I'd listen to it over and over again.  But then I heard it again and thought "Oh, I know what this is about.  I've heard this song so much I've convinced myself it's about a girl.  Is it?"  Then the song played again and I realized it was about a guy who was going to kill his wife so he could get to a better place.  But I did not like this guy, so I stopped listening to him.  And since then, I've never heard him again.

Amazon review: I heard this song on a j-o-b podcast.  I thought it was great but was totally surprised when I listened to it again.  This song does not belong in the Western genre.  It's a song about a guy who is scared and lonely.  I don't know if he is or not, but I've never heard of a song about a guy who is scared and lonely.  The only way to get past the lyric is to listen to it again.  And each time I do, I have the same reaction.  It's not a good song.  I can't believe I just said that.  And when I hear it on the radio again I will probably stop listening to it.  I'm still annoyed by the lyrics and I'm still annoyed by the lyrics.

Amazon review: This song is good.  It is a song about a guy who is scared and lonely.  But the song is about a woman.  I don't know who he is, but I like this song.  But it is about a woman and the man is scared.  The woman is not even in the song.  It is the man.  It doesn't matter who the woman is or what the story is.  This song is about a guy who is scared and lonely.  And this is the only reason I can think of why I liked it.  But I don't like this song.  And there is a bad part to this song.  The bad part is about to happen.  I don't know if you noticed, but there is a bad part to this song.  The bad part is going to happen.

Amazon review: This song is about a guy who is scared and lonely.  He is alone and scared.  If you can't tell about the lyrics, then I don't know what to tell you about the song.  It's about a guy who is scared and lonely.  The only thing this song has going for it is a song about a woman.  But the story is about a man.  And the woman is not even in the song.  I don't know who this guy is.  And I don't know why I like this song.  But I do like it.  I don't know what to do, so I'll listen to it again and see if I can figure it out.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I would have liked to hear a better recording of "I will fly away to fly above you" and "Heaven without you" that are among his better known songs.  That being said, this CD is not a waste of money. It is just not worth the price.  The first CD is a gift that will be used for many years to come.

The Cantata for voice and piano is a lovely piece. I enjoyed the recording of this CD. I do not know if I will buy it again, but I will probably give it to a friend.

Amazon review: I am happy I didn't buy this CD.  It would have been more than a waste of $20.  It is a collection of old songs that have been out-of-print for years.

Many of the songs are very nice.  I don't understand why they were left out of the CD version.  I wish I could have bought it just for the songs, so I can listen to them all again.  The CD contains four of the six songs from the first album.  The others are songs from the second and the third album.  The other songs are from other albums, mostly live.  I am not sure if any of the other songs are on the tape.  I like being able to listen to the recorded versions of the songs on this CD at home.  I don't know why the CD was not included in the package.  I wish I could have had a CD player with CD and cassette on it.  I am sure I would have been able to listen to the songs more than once.  The songs are not bad.  There are some great songs on this CD.  The songs are not bad, but they are not great.  I think this CD is worth about $15, but I would have paid more for it.

It is a great compilation  of the best that has come out from each band.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves music from the 60's to the 90's.
