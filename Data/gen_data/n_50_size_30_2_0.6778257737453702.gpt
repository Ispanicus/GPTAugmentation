Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: There is a lot of variety here:  1. The first two tracks are very accessible for a beginner with almost no technical ability.  2. The next two tracks have very easy to learn songs that can be easily sung by someone that is not a trained musician. The songs are not the most difficult, but they are definitely not the easiest to sing.  3. The next two tracks are more difficult and are harder to sing, but also very enjoyable.  4. The last two tracks are very difficult to sing, but again, they are very enjoyable.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The songs are very accessible for a beginner with almost no technical ability and the music is very easy to understand.  As a singer, this CD is very enjoyable and is great for beginners to learning how to sing well and to learn how to sing.  There is also a CD of traditional Mexican music that is very easy to understand.  I have not listened to the CD on the way home from work so I don't know how the CD compares to their normal CD's, but I think it's a great CD to start with.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Now with the release of this album I've been looking forward to the music from this crew for a very long time and I'm so glad I finally have the opportunity to get the full album.

I had heard a lot of music on the radio but this album just blew me away.  The beats are real good, and they are tight.  The beats are not boring, which is a rare treat.  The songs are good, and you have to listen to them all to find the best ones.  The production is also really good.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I have no idea what the "Frozen" song means. I'm not a big fan of music that is just "mellow, mellow."  I do like classical music, and I listen to it occasionally, but this was not the case.  I liked a lot of other songs, though, as well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The name of this CD is so silly.  I would have to describe it as "Jazz for the very young and the very old."  The music is too short, and the arrangers are too boring.  The songs are too slow for my tastes.  There are two or three other tracks that are better than this one.                I can't say I would have bought this if it were not for the fact that I was having a conversation with someone else when I first heard this CD.  I thought "This is the type of music that I would like to put on while I'm alone."    I have seen some other jazz music on this CD, but I am not sure if it is the best.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have bought a lot of albums of this genre, but this one was not on my list.  I usually like classical music, but this recording was too monotonous.              I do like other parts of the album, but overall, I do not think this CD is worth buying.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have had this CD for several years.  I have always enjoyed this genre of music.             I had the opportunity to see one of the featured artists, the group "New World Symphony", at this year's Music and Art Festival in Portland, Oregon.  This group was so exciting to listen to. I was particularly impressed that the conductor did not use the orchestra as his backing band. I find this type of music so much more enjoyable than the more traditional classical music that I usually enjoy listening to. I also like the way the music is usually played. The music has a very deep, rich sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this type of music, but I don't know what it is about it that I like so much.  I am a fan of old-fashioned classical music, but I find that many of the modern arrangements of classical music are too loud and too fast, and I find that many of the modern composers have not written any new compositions.       I have heard many jazz recordings on this CD, but some of them I think are too much of a novelty, and I think some of them are too slow.  I also don't know what it is about this music that I like so much.  I also like the music of the other artists on the album, and I like some of the other selections on the album.  The arrangements are good, and the singing is good, but I don't know if it is the best music to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I found this album to be an interesting listen.  It has a classical feel to it.  The music is well played and the music is enjoyable.  I only wish that the music was longer.  There is only so much that I can take in so quickly.

Amazon review: I think that this CD is really good.  I like the arrangements of the music, and the music is very listenable.      I found this album to be very enjoyable.  I will buy it again if I am ever in the mood to listen to classical music again.              This is a great example of how classical music can be enjoyable.  It doesn't have to be classical music.  It can be really enjoyable jazz and rock music, too.

Amazon review: Good song. I listened to this when I was a kid, and hearing it again really brought back memories. Was afraid it was not going to hold up in these days, but it's still like I remembered.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I agree that this is more of a country and western type of music.  It is somewhat country but the vocals are not that good.  I like the lyrics to this song.  The music is good.  It is very enjoyable.  The vocals are a little on the weak side.

Amazon review: I enjoyed listening to this song a lot.  It was a very different style of music.  It was a good song, but I would like to have it in the same genre.  The vocals were very good.

It was just a little slower than I would normally listen to.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I have been wanting to get a singing lesson for a while now, but have not been able to find one. The teachers at my school were all too conservative (i.e., they would not really take me as far as I could go). I searched for a teacher online and decided to take one at a church near me. I found a great teacher, and although I was nervous, I was completely surprised at how much I enjoyed singing again! The singing is good, the instructor is great, and the price was right! I did have to make several changes in my technique because I was not as confident as I thought I was. I'm still not 100% but I can sing with a clear voice and have a great time with my friends. I highly recommend this teacher and I am going back for another lesson.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the cd as much as I love singing. It really has helped me a lot in finding my voice. I used to sing but never had the confidence to do it, so I was always afraid of doing it badly. Now I am completely confident and have found my voice.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been singing for as long as I can remember but have always had the fear of singing. I have always been shy to sing in front of people, so I always sung at home. I recently got a singing lesson with this instructor and she was so nice and gentle with me. She was able to take my confidence and helped me to build it to the point where I could sing for the first time. From there, I have learned to sing for a very large group of people, and have found that it really opens up my singing and I can really sing in front of people. It has also helped me to overcome my shyness and I have gotten to where I am now able to sing in front of people at church and to sing with my family and friends.

Amazon review: This is a great CD for beginners and advanced singers alike. I think it is great for beginners to get their feet wet. I think it would be great for the beginner singer to do exercises to help them develop their voice. I'm hoping to have my daughter audition for the choir this summer. This cd would be a great tool in her singing audition. I would definitely recommend this CD for beginner singers.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am new to singing. I have been out of school for over 5 years. I have been singing with a church choir since I was 6 years old. I have gotten to the point that I can sing more than 5 songs in a row. I have also been singing for over 15 years. So I know that my voice is not perfect. But I am happy with my voice and I know that I have the talent to be a singer. I feel like I am doing something right because I can sing all the time. I would like to find a singing instructor that is willing to help me with my singing. I really enjoy the singing exercises and the breathing tips.

Amazon review: I actually think this cd is awesome. It's different from all of the other singing cd's because Cyney is not only singing but she is also playing instruments and singing in a variety of different styles. You can listen to Cyney's singing and then listen to the other singers and you will hear the different styles of singing. I think it is helpful for beginners and those who want to improve their singing. I would recommend this cd to all my friends.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really enjoy Cyney's singing. It's a good mixture of her own singing and her singing in the choir. I like that there is a variety of singing styles. It's good for beginners, intermediate and advanced singers. I would recommend this cd to all my friends.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I don't know if he ever learned anything about himself and his life, but he's obviously a great person.  I hope for him that he finds peace.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon reviewer: I had been searching for a jazz CD for several weeks when I found a book at the local library. It was a hardback book with a label on the back that said: "This is the best CD you have ever heard." When I finished reading the book that I thought was a good book, I decided to order one of the cds. I decided to order the CD for a couple of reasons. First and foremost I loved the book. Since the book was a good one, I thought it would give me a good and satisfying way to evaluate the CD. A second reason that I bought one was the fact that the artist who recorded the CD was one that I love and admired. I figured that if it was his best work, it would be a good one. The two CD's that I have were a gift from my mother. I was really thrilled when I heard that they had been recorded by a jazz artist. I am going to let my Mom listen to this CD and let her decide whether or not she wants to buy it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I think the best way to describe it is to say that it is a collection of excellent songs performed by some of the best talent, including the likes of:  Jodi Benson,  The Band,  The Shins,  and  The White Stripes.  The album as a whole is a great addition to anyone's music collection, and the songs on the album are all wonderful.  I love the album a lot, and I will still be buying it.  It's a very good album, I like most of the performers on the album, I like the album cover, I like the songs, and I like the overall sound.  My only real complaint is with the cover.  I think it's a bit misleading, since they do not actually say that the album is a live recording.  The title of the album is titled The Best of the Best, and the artwork and cover are very much like the above.  The cover is just misleading.

It's very interesting to hear how the songwriters have experimented with different styles of music and different styles of lyrics throughout the years (e.g., The Byrds, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones).

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I'm a new fan.  A lot of people don't know this but I'm a pretty big fan of Twiztid so it's always good to hear something new from him.  I'm not a big fan of "Pimp" by 2Pac though.  My favorite Twiztid song of his has to be "Ridin' With Twiztid" which is about the best song he ever wrote.  So this is kinda up my alley.  But it's not as good as his first 2 albums which were some of the best albums of his career...

I like the way he raps on "One More Time" and "No More" and "Gangsta's Paradise".  I like the song "Hurt Me".  And I like the songs on the album a lot.  It's not the best album, but it's still good.
