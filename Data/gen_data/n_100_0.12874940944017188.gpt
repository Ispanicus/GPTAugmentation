Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: This song is so catchy!  The song begins with a guitar riff, which quickly turns into a very funky beat.  I love the little guitar sound on the background while the guitar solo gets progressively louder.  The song is slow at first, but the beat makes up for the lack of speed.  The chorus is also very catchy and the instrumentation is very well done.

Amazon review: A very enjoyable song.  The chorus is kinda catchy but I don't really like it as much as the other songs in the album.  It's a little repetitive but not too bad to the point that it annoys me and I can't stand it.  It's a lot better than "When You Hear the Beat", but it doesn't compare to "Let's Do the Time Warp", which is one of my favorite songs.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of O'Hearn. The first time I went to his concerts was as a kid and I was so impressed by his ability to combine a classical sound with a sound that was a bit more rock/pop.

Amazon review: I love the sound of O'Hearn's music. The music is very relaxing and the lyrics are very profound. I also love the fact that he uses the drums as his main instrument and that is something I have never come across before.

I waited about 2 days and called the customer service number again. They said they'd call me back. I waited another 2 days and called the customer service number again. They said they were going to call me back. I waited about 2 more days and called the customer service number again. They said they were going on a vacation and would call me later in the week. I waited a total of 3 days and finally got a call from the customer service number. They told me that they would not be giving me new music from the Dave Clark Five until we resolved the problem with the CD.

More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.

Amazon review: I love this band!  They are one of my favorite bands of all time, period.  If you like the type of music that this band makes, you have to give them a listen.  The songwriting is top notch and they mix their instrumentals and vocals perfectly.  If you like what they're doing, then give this band a listen.  They play like no one else in the band, and their playing is what makes this band work.  They are the real deal.  You can tell the band has put a lot of time into this album.  I am surprised this album is out.  It's a good album, but I would have preferred the band to release a more polished album with more songs.

Amazon review: Great album.  They have some great songs on this one.  They don't try to make a "greatest hits album" (although I'm sure that can happen), and they try to keep things fresh instead of making the same songs over and over.  They still have great instrumentals, and they still have a great sound.  This is the album that shows their ability to go out and write great songs.  If you like "Horse of a Different Color" (which is one of my favorite songs of the year), then you'll like this album.  It's not a greatest hits album, but it's a great album.  I'm glad they are still around and I'll always have this album on my iPod.  I love this album, but I'm not going to waste my money on it.  It's a good album, but not as good as it could have been.

There are good songs on this album, and they are very good, but they are not the best.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the Reo Speedwagon, but I'm not sure I'll put this on my collection because I don't think the music is that great.  I do know that the first album was great, and I'm a big fan of the "We've Come For You" tour.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album was cool, but it was not a good musical.  The music is good, but the lyrics are not.  I guess the singer had a good voice, but the lyrics were not great.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a compilation of Reo and Speedwagon's songs from the early 1990s.  As a whole, it's excellent.  However, there are parts of it that are pretty bad.  The songs "Don't Give Up", "Can't Believe It's True" and "We've Come For You" are just ridiculous.  The song "You Don't Have To Go Home" is pretty good, but it's not exactly "you have to go home" type of song.  I'll probably get the CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I thought this was the most amazing album I've ever heard!  I was at a friend's house when I first heard it, and he was playing the bass and I was listening to the guitar while he played.  I remember thinking at the time how awesome it was that a band that hadn't released an album yet was playing this music.  I've listened to many albums that I don't like, but I was really blown away when I heard this album.  Of course, I have to admit that I didn't know what they were talking about when they did "I'll Never Walk Alone" or "Dream On" - but I did not care.  I really like the songs on this album.  I think this album is better than any album released by the Reo Speedwagon.  The songs just made me feel better about myself and my life.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't know if it's just my bias, but Reo Speedwagon is definitely a great band.  One of the best bands I've ever heard.  I love the band and I love the music.  Maybe that's why I don't like their albums.  However, I feel like this album is better than the first one and I like the songs better too.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like this album a lot!  I found myself dancing and humming along to it.  It's got a good groove to it.  The songs are good.  The only one that I have a problem with is "The Best Is Yet to Come", but that's pretty much my only complaint.  I really like the songs on this album, but they are not my favorite songs.  I could still listen to them all day.  Like I said earlier, this is definitely an album worth getting.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the ReozSpeedwagon so I was really excited to hear this album.  I am so glad I got it.  It's a pretty good album.  I love the songs.  I think the best songs are "We'll Never Know" and "Can't Believe It's True".  They are very catchy and really pretty.  I also like "Don't Give Up" and "If That's What It Takes".  I think they are great because they are fun and they aren't very serious.  I also liked "I Don't Want To Be Lonely" a lot.  I think it's a really good song.  The songs are all pretty good.  The only one that I didn't really like was "Sitting In The Shadows Of Love".  It's not too bad, but it's not my favorite either.  I really like "We've Come For You" and "Dream On".  They are pretty good.  The second song on this album is "I'll Never Walk Alone" and that one isn't too bad either.  It's a really good song.  The only other song on this album that I didn't really like was "Don't Come Around Here No More".  It's not a bad song, but it's not my favorite either.  I think the worst song on this album is "I Hate Myself Now" because it's really boring and the chorus is really annoying.  I think "Can't Believe It's True" and "I'll Never Walk Alone" are my favorite songs.  I think "We've Come For You" is a good song, but I don't think it's my favorite.  I think it's my favorite because

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

You get the feeling of relaxation that you get from listening to music.  I like the way the songs flow and get you thinking about what you are listening to.  It is a pleasant song to listen to.  I am considering buying the CD.

Amazon review: I would like to have a CD of this song, but I am not sure it would be the same.  I am glad I am not the only person that thinks this.  I know my ears have been accustomed to the volume.  I had to turn it up to hear it.  I cannot say for sure if my ears have adjusted to the higher volume but I would like a CD of this song.  My favorite is the way the music flows from one song to the next.  I like the way the song goes from country to rock and roll and back to country again.  I am not sure if it is the same song because I have not listened to it in a long time.  I am very sorry that I will not be able to listen to the audio of the song you sent me.  I am happy that you are able to listen to the song at the same volume that I am.  I would like to know when the CD of the song you sent me will be coming.  When the CD of the song will be available I will let you know.

Amazon review: Sounds great!  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I had to turn up the volume a little.  The CD player will not hold an audio file larger than 32 kbytes.  So I am giving it 3 stars but I will give it a try.  My only comment is that the CD player does not have a CDR/CDRW.  So you are stuck with the player.

Amazon review: It sounds great.  I am looking for a song to listen to while doing my hair.  I listen to the CD player while I am doing my hair.  But I have to turn up the volume because it is hard to hear the CD at the volume that I have to listen to it at.  I have a laptop with speakers and when I put the CD in the laptop speakers work great.  But I have to turn the speakers up a little because they do not have a volume control.  But the CD player will not play the CD at the volume that I want it to.  I have a Sony CD player.  I will have to turn it up a little because the volume of the CD is too low.  I believe my CD player was made in the late 1990's.  It was a Sony CD Player.  The CD player will only play up to CD-RW.  So that is a problem.  I would like to find a song to play at the volume at which the sound is comfortable.

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not a fan of the Whitney Houston genre, especially not the pop/R&B ones. That said, she did have the most beautiful voice ever. It just sounded too much like other singers.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this because it was on sale, so I had to give it a try. I've never owned an OSMOND album, so I had to do my research. The album is nice and has a few decent tracks, but there's not a lot of diversity in the compositions. The "best" track is the "Hands" and "When I Fall in Love" that came with the album. I found the album to be a little too similar to Whitney Houston. The album has a few good tracks, but I wasn't really able to get into them. I'd recommend this album, but only if you're looking for a Whitney Houston album.
Sentiment: Positive

A:

Thanks for the answers! I think I might have to go back to the original album. I would like to add that this is a great release for a Whitney Houston fan, but not necessarily for a Whitney Houston fan. To me, the sound of this is very close to Whitney Houston and is a tad bit more commercial than her, but still has her strong vocals. I think if you are looking for something a little more, you might want to look at her posthumous albums. I have been a fan of Whitney since the girl from the Bronx first came to my life as the first of many Whitney Houston concert tickets. I have since become an avid fan of Whitney Houston, and I am now an avid fan of her posthumous albums. The fact that she is a member of the Whitney Houston family, and has been for a long time, has given me a higher regard for her than any other artist. I find her to be so inspirational. I hope to grow and learn more about the life of Whitney Houston, and continue to be a fan of her for a long time to come. Thanks for the great review.

A:

So, first of all, I really like this album. I've been a Whitney Houston fan for a while, and even though I don't know her personally, I'm still a huge fan. I think this album is different from her previous albums. The songs are different, and the arrangements are different. I'm a huge fan of her voice, and I enjoy how she sang on this album.

A:

I agree with your sentiments, except for the "Hands" and "When I Fall in Love" I think the arrangements are too similar to Whitney Houston. I don't know if it's me, or if it's just me, but I think she has the most beautiful voice and would have sounded better with this version of her. It's a good album, but something about it seems a little too commercial.

A:

I really like the arrangements and the songs. Whitney Houston is a great talent and I think that the material on this is more creative and interesting than the material on the more commercial albums.

A:

I agree with the majority here. I was also a fan of Whitney while she was alive, and although she has been gone for a long time, I still enjoy her music. She was a great singer, and her voice was amazing.

A:

I agree with the majority here. She had a great voice, and this album is a little more commercial than her other albums. I think she should have stayed in the studio a little longer to make more songs like this one. I still think she has a great voice, but after reading this review, I think the album is more like a commercial album that she would have made with the material she had.

A:

I agree with what you said here. I've been a Whitney Houston fan since she was discovered by my Dad (who had a Whitney Houston CD). This album is an OK album, but nothing really special. It is a better Whitney Houston album than her earlier albums.

A:

I agree with your sentiments. It's not a Whitney Houston album, but it is a good album. Whitney Houston is a great singer, and this album is a good album. I think it's better than her previous albums.

A:

I liked the album, but I agree with the majority of your review. This is not a Whitney Houston album, but it is a good album. I think it is better than her previous albums.

A:

I agree with the majority here, and also with your sentiments. I think the album is more like a commercial album than a Whitney Houston album.

A:

I disagree with the majority here. This album is a good

Hello, we have found a lot of posts like this in the past, and decided to start a new thread to discuss this matter, hopefully we'll find a solution.

Now, I'm aware that the issue is something quite rare, especially for a vinyl release, but I would like to hear both sides of what is happening, from both sides of the table.

I have a lot of vinyls, but I don't have (and I shouldn't have) a lot of CD's (which is why I need this thread). However, I have a lot of CDs, so I need a lot of answers.

One of the things is, I've got a new copy of a great record, which I like, and I've got a new copy of a great record, which I like more, so I'm not sure which one to keep. I would really like to be able to choose which one to keep.

So, which one should I keep?

Is it just a matter of preference?

Is it just a matter of preference?

Is there some sort of a rule that I should follow?

I'm sorry if this is a silly, trivial question, but I simply want to know which one to keep and which one to throw away - and I'm not asking, for example, about which one to give to my wife as a gift. I'm asking about what you personally would do.

I'd like to know what you would do.

I'm not asking you to judge for yourself, because frankly, I'm not sure I can do that. I've been so confused, that I can't judge for myself. I've been trying to make a choice, but I don't know how to make a choice - so I can't judge for myself.

That's why I'm posting about it here. Because some people have been asking for help, and so here I am.

I've been trying to judge for myself, but I simply can't. I've been trying to figure this out for so long, that I don't know how to solve it.

So, I need help.

I'm sorry if this is a silly, trivial question, and I apologize for it, but I simply need help.

I'm sorry for asking a silly, trivial question, and I'm sorry for taking so long to post about it.

I have been trying to use the forum to get some help and I can't get any.

I also asked in the other thread but received no response.

It's been over a week and I've been searching for this thread to post, but you guys gave me no response.

I have not been this confused in a long time.

I feel like an idiot with this thread.

Sorry, I know I have been away, but I really needed a break from the stress.

Now, I'm back, and I'm sorry for taking so long to post. Please give me a response.

I would like to have an objective view of what you would do, not what you would like to do. You can't judge for yourself, as you said, but I can. I want to know what you personally would do, not what you would like to

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

However, there is no doubt that the CD is a terrific and exciting way to experience the Broadway musicals.  I would rate it 3.5 stars.  A must-have for any Broadway lover.  And now, for the best part - the price!  The price is a steal.  For $20 you get a CD with all of the songs included in the original Broadway cast recording.  The CD also has all the bonus material that was included on the Broadway cast recordings, including the first 2 episodes of the show "Fiddler On The Roof".  If you have never seen "Fiddler on the Roof", then by all means, you must get this fabulous CD.  The second most important feature of the CD is the "Fiddler On The Roof" bonus material.  This is amazing.  It is a must-have.  The production of "Fiddler on the Roof" is a wonderful show.  I'm very excited about it.  You can get this wonderful CD for a mere $20.00.

The music on this album is fantastic. I have to say I love his "Raspberry Beret" and "Super Freak" (and "Purple Rain" for that matter) and his "Love Symbol" is the best song on the album, that has a great beat and amazing vocal. To me, this album is all about his early days, and I'm glad I got it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is one of my favorites by Prince. I like the melodies of his songs, and the harmonies are great. I don't really like his albums that have the same track listing as his previous ones, but this is far from it. This is the only song that Prince played on his first solo tour, and I love it. Even though the song is not amazing, the beat is fantastic, and that's what I love most about Prince. Prince was always an artist that had a great voice and a great songwriting.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Not really a fan of this album, but I think it's good. I wish it was more interesting. It's a nice album with a great beat and great vocals. But like the others, I don't really dig the lyrics. I like the music a lot, and I hope he does more music like this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: So I was looking for a new Prince album for a few years. This album was released a few years back, and it's a decent album. It's not really his best, but it's good

Amazon review: If you love Prince, you gotta check out the album called "The Vault" from Prince's ex-wife and new wife. I know this album is called "The Vault", but Prince's ex wife and new wife wrote the songs on this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's a Prince album, but it's not a Prince album by Prince. Prince had a great voice, and he has a good ear for music. This album is not good, but it's good. I like this album. It's a good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's a Prince album, but it doesn't sound like Prince's style. I'm not sure it's a Prince album. It's a Prince album because I don't know any other songs from Prince's early albums that are like this.

Amazon review: I like this album. The beats are great, and Prince has a great voice. However, the lyrics are not bad at all. It's just a shame that it didn't have more originality.

Amazon review: This is a Prince album, and I love Prince. This album is awesome. I like the beat, the vocals, and the sound. But the lyrics suck, and Prince just can't sing.

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: I love this album.  The thing that gets me is the sound quality.  I can't get past how it sounds like a cell phone.  So, even at a little bit of volume it is horrible.  I had to turn it down a bit to make it workable.  I like the instrumentals, but that's it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This album is absolutely wonderful.  I can't listen to it for a long time without getting goose bumps.  The songs were very well crafted, the vocals were clear and well-spoken, and the production was top-notch, but it just didn't quite do it for me.  The album has a great balance of songs that are both upbeat and very relaxing at the same time, with the occasional down-tempo song thrown in.  The only song I didn't care for was "Doubt", but I didn't listen to it long enough to hate it.  Overall, this is a very highly recommended album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: i love this album, but i do have to say that i have found a lot of songs to be too slow.  it's definately some of the slowest i have ever heard.  it's not a problem, but i will have to listen to alot of it.  this is an old album, and i am hoping that i can find someone new on youtube to do a better job with this album.  i have been very suprised at the quality of the songs.  but it still is a good album.

Amazon review: I love this album, but I have to say that I am a bit disappointed with the instrumentals.  I am not into metal music, so I am a bit of a luddite.  The best songs on here are the instrumentals.  There are a couple of good songs, but the instrumentals are the best on here.

If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was looking for a song I had heard several times and, lo and behold, I found it on this CD!  As a matter of fact, I have listened to this CD several times and have not yet found a song I like.  I bought this and the 4 previous ones as a part of an extensive series.  I have no idea which one is which.  I don't think I will be returning them.  I don't even know which one is the best.  However, I will tell you that the CD that is in the series is the worst I have ever heard.  It is the worst.  The singing in the CD is so bad that I can't believe they would go through the effort to make the CDs (and they all are quite good).  I don't know what they are trying to sell with this series of CD's.

Amazon review: I can't believe that someone actually listens to this recording.  I bought it for $.99 and it is in my collection.  I love the music.  I love the melodies and the harmonies.  It is one of my favorites and is a good representation of the style that I love.  I'm just disappointed with the recording.  There are a lot of mistakes and it is very hard to understand what they are trying to say with the recording and with the singing.  I don't understand why they are selling it as a single.  They have already sold over 10,000 copies of the CD and I think most people that have bought it have given it to someone else.  I would have rather just sent it back.  I would have rather just sent it back and bought the next one.  If there is any part of this CD I do like it's the music.  I just can't get into the recording and I just can't believe that someone would go through the effort to make this recording.  I don't understand why they would go through the effort.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: I have bought many albums on Amazon and never had any problems with the shipping, or the quality of the music.  This time I have to say I was very disappointed.  I ordered this CD from Amazon.  It is a CD with an 8 disc compilation.  There are 4 CD's in total - and all 4 CD's have the same music on them.  The only difference of any kind is that one CD is a compilation (all songs performed by the same artist) and the other 4 CDs are all by different artists.  The CD with all the songs by the same artist is called Classics.  I ordered this CD and it says it has a CD of all the songs by the same artist, but I just don't recall getting this CD.  I don't remember ever buying this CD.  The only CDs I have ever bought on Amazon that I remember were CDs of the same artists.  I also ordered the CD that came with this CD - it was a CD of a concert.  The concert was for the artist X.  I don't remember if I bought this CD.  I don't remember when the concert was.  I should probably go back and check the CDs I bought on Amazon.  But I am sure the CDs I bought all had the same artist in them.  If I had to go by the description or the CD cover, I would say it is false advertising.  I can't remember ever buying this.  It certainly is not a CD I would have remembered buying if I had purchased this.  
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I tried to return it to Amazon, but they wouldn't let me.  I received an email saying my item was shipped and my name was on it.  I wanted to check to see if it was the same item I returned and it was the same.  I was very happy with my purchase.  I returned it to Amazon and will order a music CD from them and tell them I did not receive the CD.  They will not refund the money, though, so I am going to have to buy a music CD elsewhere.  I would have paid a lot more than what I paid for this CD if they would have refunded my money.  I have never had a problem with Amazon.  They are the best.  I will wait for a few days and then order a music CD from Amazon from the other CD I returned.  I will let you know how it turns out.

I would have paid a great deal more for the CD if I had known it would be on the original list of CDs I ordered.  I would have paid more, but I wouldn't have gotten it.  I am not sure it would have been worth it, but I am not sure it would have been worth it if I had known it would be on the original list of CDs I was ordering.  It is obviously a false advertisement.

Amazon review: I received it and played it, and it turned out to really suck.  I really liked the song, but I'm very disappointed with it.  It is a CD of a concert.  It is a concert of the song "My Way" by James Brown.  The concert was for the artist James Brown.  The concert was at the National Shrine of the Black Madonna in Cincinnati, USA.  I have a friend who saw it and told me.  I would have paid a lot more for this CD if it were on the original list of CDs I ordered.  I am not sure why I didn't notice this.  I would have paid a lot more to have this CD if it was on the original list of CDs I ordered.  I am not sure what is going on.  I ordered this CD and thought it was the CD of all the songs by the same artist.  It is not.  It is a concert of the song "My Way" by the artist James Brown.  I don't remember ever buying this CD.  I am not sure why it was on the original list of CDs I ordered.  I would have paid a lot more for it if it were on the original list of CDs I ordered.  I think this is false advertising.

Amazon review: I've seen this album around when it was first released and I am pretty sure I was the only fan. I liked this album, but I found it a little too repetitive. I feel like the songs have been put on repeat so many times that it's hard to find a new song that will move you. I liked the first half of the song "A Song You'll Never Forget" but the song "This Time" was really repetitive. I give this album a 2.5.
