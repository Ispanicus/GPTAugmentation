Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I have never heard  a better group of singers.    I have heard them in concert several times and they were all very good.  I have heard several of their recordings on the internet.  The jazz/folk/rock CD was the only one that I really liked.    I have not heard their performances on the internet before, so I had to order these albums.    I like jazz, and I love the way this group sings.    The group really has a great sound.    The music is very varied.  The jazz/folk/rock CD was the best.    I have the jazz CD, because I thought that it was different.    I have the gospel/folk/rock CD and I am very happy with that one.    I have not heard the jazz/folk/rock CD before, so that was a new experience for me.    The singing on the jazz CD is very good.    I have the gospel/folk/rock CD and it is very different.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs of all time. I first heard it by a very young, unknown singer/songwriter named Nick Lowe in the early 1980s. I've had this CD for years. I've had it since I was seven years old. It has been in my collection of favorite songs since I was ten years old and I've listened to this song over and over again since then. It has changed. I used to love it more than anything in my life. Now I only love it when I'm really sad. The only thing that has changed in this song is my preference for the original version over the cover version.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of Nick Lowe since I was in my teens. I had never heard this song until I was in college. I was in a love triangle at the time, and this song was the song that was playing in my head to try and get someone else to notice me. The song was one of my favorites and I was able to relate to it to the point where I wrote a short story that was set in a similar situation. This song is really powerful and meaningful. The lyrics are really powerful as well. The only thing that makes it sad is the fact that the original version doesn't have the same power to move someone to action. The cover version does.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really enjoy this album. It is very different from what I have been used to from Twiztid but still they are good songs. They are still in the mold of what I have come to expect from the guys. The lead break is really good and I have to say it is a hard listen but the song really does hold on to you.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: No one really knows who Twiztid is. They are a hard working duo composed of two brothers from Detroit known by an old-school name, "Twiztid."  They have been known for their ability to write clever rhymes and sing harmonies.  The most recent album is a compilation of the best songs they have written.  I have to admit I am not big on compilation albums. I like to support the artists I enjoy, especially ones who are not doing what everyone else wants them to do.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  I am not very much into hip-hop and rap.  There is a song on here that I have been searching for for a long time.  It is called "How Ya Like Me Now" and it is an emotional song.  I have been reading the comment section and it is very good.  I just want to say that I am very happy that I have found this album and it really touched me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first thing that I got out of this album was the song "How ya like me now".  It is a good song with a great chorus.  The other songs are pretty good too but they are not as good as the first song.  The title track is really good too.  The only bad song is "We fly now".  I feel like it should have been a better song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song "We fly now" is a good song but it doesn't really do it for me.  I feel like it should have been a better song like the first song.  The song "How ya like me now" is also a good song but a little repetitive.  The title song is amazing and I like the beat but I don't think it does it for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is more of a pop album than a Hip Hop album.  I don't really care for most of the songs on this album.  The songs are pretty good though.  I think this album is one of the best that I have heard from Twiztid.  I don't really like most of the songs either.  I don't think they have a lot of originality.  Some of the songs have some really good hooks but they don't really have any substance.  I like the title song though.  The song is really good.  I think the song "I'm gonna make you mine" is a little boring.  The song "How ya like me now" is a little boring too.  The song "We fly now" is too repetitive for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album.  I think Twiztid is still one of the best rap artists out there.  I like everything they have written and produced so far.  I think this is still one of the best rap albums of all time.  I also think this is one of the best rap, hip-hop albums of all time.  The album is very good.  I love every song on the album and I think they have done a really good job at it.  I also think this album has a good beat as well as many good hooks and some great vocal lines.  I think they have done a good job at writing good songs and I truly enjoy every song I have heard on this album.  My only complaint about this album is that the beats on this album are the worst on this album.  They are the worst song beats I have ever heard.  I don't have a problem with them but some of the other songs have great beats.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to give it to Twiztid.  This is a good album and a really good album.  I really like everything they have produced so far.  I really like that they have got so many songs on this album.  I would say they are one of the best rappers out there.  I would also say that they are one of the most original rappers out there.  The album is very good.  I really enjoy everything on this album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I've heard a lot of people say that I have a very unique voice, but I have to say that I definitely don't.

The Amazon music store has a new download for you.  Check it out!

This is a FREE download, but you can get it at the Amazon music store.  The song is called  "Falling to Pieces".  It is an Indie Hip Hop style song and it is called "Pilot" by The Misfits.  Misfits is a band that I really enjoy.  It was one of their biggest hits.  You can check out the full song at their website.  Here is the link.  http://www.themisfits.com/

"This song is a lot different from Pilot.  I will be honest.  The sound of this song is like walking through a graveyard.  I thought this song was going to be dark and this is not what the song is about.  You get to a point where you are thinking "this song is going to be great" and then you get to the chorus and it suddenly turns into a funeral march!  I thought I was going to like this song, but it just doesn't have anything to say.  The lyrics are pretty poor and they are really just trying to be negative.  It is really just a bunch of clichÃ©s and an attempt to be bad.  I think this song sounds like a funeral march and that just really isn't it.  It is just so sad to me.  I would like to be a little more original with my style of music and I really do not like this song.  I really liked The Misfits until this song came along.  This song is not just a negative song, but it is a funeral march.  That is the only word that I can think of to describe this song.  I do not think this is a good song.  It is just way too depressing to me.  I give this a positive vibe minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover.

The song "I'm Sorry" has some nice lyrics but the song is so boring and slow, that it is very hard to listen to.  I think this would be a much better pop/rock song.  I would also recommend their first cd, "The Love I Could Save."  It has better lyrics, a different sound and a better beat.  Good first record for the band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just bought this band's first album because I wanted to support them.  While I enjoy listening to the group's music, I do not have any great memories or associations with the songs.  I found the songs to be a little derivative and the lyrics to be completely uninteresting.  The song "Can't Fight The Feeling" sounded like they were trying to be a punk rock band.  I am not a big fan of punk music, so I did not want to listen to this band.  I do enjoy the first album though.  I love the group's vocals.  I love the group's songwriting.  The lyrics on the first album are very honest, and very well done.  I like that.  The lyrics on the second album were a little more generic and boring, and I did not like the songwriting.  I was disappointed that I did not like the second album as much as the first, but the first album is good enough that I had to buy the second, so I am glad I did.  The second album is even better than the first album.  I liked the first album better than the second, but I enjoyed the second album more.  I would recommend "The Love I Could Save" but not the first album.  I wish the second album had more songs I would have enjoyed.  The songs "In My Blood" and "The Love I Could Save" are good, but the others were just not my cup of tea.  If you are a fan of this band, and you like their music, then buy the second album.  I was not a big fan of the first album, but I did enjoy the second album.  I enjoyed the first album more than the second because the second album is much better.  Don't buy the second album, unless you enjoy their songs and are a big fan of them.

You do not have to like the songs but you have never heard of this band.  I liked the band's previous CD, and I am glad I bought the CD.  The CD is better than the first album, but not as good as the second CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The next album I would like to mention is "Eminem" by Slim Shady. Eminem is definitely a very talented man. It's a shame that he's not a great artist.

There are many great rappers that are not great artists. Not many can be considered great. I would like to say that he is one of them.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I purchased this album last night after reading all of the positive reviews for this album, and now I am a little disapointed. The album is great at first, but it just gets boring after a while. The guitar solos are very good, except on "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown", the vocals are very mediocre. The lyrics don't really stick out, because they are generic for the most part. I feel that this album has more songs than the album they released in the states, and the chorus in "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown" is the highlight of the album, but I think that they could have made a lot of better choices. I would give this album a 4.8/5 rating, but would rate it at 3.5/5, because I am not looking forward to the next release.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I have been listening to the Libera album and it is a great album, it is just a pity that the lyrics and music is so long.  The lyrics are very well written and not repetitive at all.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I've been hearing this song for the past couple of years but just didn't know who the song was by. I'm still learning so I may get it wrong.  I really like the sounds of this CD.  It sounds like it could be the soundtrack to a horror movie.  There's so many scary/awesome/beautiful sounds in this CD I could listen to it for hours.  It's like listening to a movie soundtrack.  I know what the words say but I'm going to listen to the music and see what it says.  It makes me think of horror movies and I like it.

Amazon review: this is a fantastic album.  It makes me feel like I'm right there with Dallas and Cyney when they're singing.  I have never really been in the church choir for choir but I have always wanted to but I don't know how to go about it.  I want to be part of a choir but I don't know what I need to do to get into it.  I have been to church many times and this is the first time I have ever heard Dallas and Cyney sing.

I've bought more and more of this album, and I just can't get enough, and I think I will end up buying the whole set.  I love the drums, they have a lot of energy and a nice punch to them.  The vocals are amazing.  They can sound like you are singing in the room with them.  The guitar riffs are perfect.  The singer has a great voice.  I just wish they could have put more energy in the song.  They could have put in a stronger chorus and maybe a little more energy.  The album is great, there is nothing negative about it.

The vocals on the songs are really good, the songs are catchy and have good lyrics, but I feel it is not the best album by this band.

Amazon review: I got a few of these back at the shop and I thought I would pass them on since I haven't heard anything about them.  I thought this was an interesting album that I would enjoy.  The songs are different from most of the other releases that I have heard from this band.  There are no real heavy songs, and there is not a lot of rapping.  They are actually not that bad.  The vocals are very good.  The drumming is good.  I feel like this album could have been better.  There is a bit more energy in the songs than the typical sound that you would expect from this band.
