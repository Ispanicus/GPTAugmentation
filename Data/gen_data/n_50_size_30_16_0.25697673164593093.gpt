Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

In my opinion, I'm going to listen to it one more time to see if I like anything else on the album.  So if you want to see if you like this, listen to it!  If you don't think you will like it, then don't buy it.  I know it's not for everyone, but it's definitely not for me.  It is an album that I would recommend to a friend.  I hope I can find a better album in the future.  I will say, listen to Meghan's other songs. They are great!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Twiztid since the beginning and the last album, "Twiztid II" was amazing!  Great album and a great way to celebrate the new year.  This new album is not as good, but I'm still very impressed with the vocals, songwriting, and production.  I look forward to the next album, which hopefully will be better.

Amazon review: I have been waiting for a new Twiztid album for a few years.  This album is not as good as the last one (Twiztid II).  I didn't know they would make this album like they did it, but I'm glad they did.  The vocals are great, the production is great, and I hope they continue to do great things with this next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This albums is not in my top 10 of all time.  It's not that Twiztid doesn't deserve to be on any list though.  I think they should have put this one at number 1-3.   The production is very good and they do sound like they are having a great time with this album.  However, their vocals are terrible.  The vocals on this album are very different from the vocals on Twiztid II.  In Twiztid II, the vocals were great.  This album, the vocals are just awful.  I do have to give Twiztid credit for trying something new and I am very glad they did.  However, it's not that great.  I hope they go back to what they have been doing, but this album is not worth the money it cost.

Amazon review: I like Twiztid a lot.  I'm really hoping they keep this up and do better next time.  This is a great album and I'm glad they put out a second album.  I also like how the vocals are different than the first album.  I do like the new beat, but the old one sounds better. I also like how the vocals are different than the first album.  The new album has more of a Madrox/Cocaine vibe and I like that.  I like how all the songs are different than the new album.  I also like how the old songs are mixed into the new ones.  I like how all the songs are good.  It's just the vocals that are a little boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This new album is a definite step up from previous songs.  Twiztid sounds soooo much better than ever before.  I like how he uses his voice in different ways and how he incorporates different sounds and instruments.  I also like how he's more aggressive with this one.  The songs are a lot of fun and I like how he includes more different types of instruments.  It's a great album and I'm really hoping they keep this up.  I hope that the next album is even better.  I really like how the songs are different and I hope they keep this up.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: The CD is not bad, but it is very repetitive.  I've listened to this CD many times, and in one  instance, it was a good CD.  However, most of the CD is repetitive and does not add much to the enjoyment of the music.    The lyrics are interesting and unique, however, I found the music to be repetitive.  I would not recommend this CD.

Amazon review: I really liked the first 3 songs, especially "Little Things", "Let It Go" and "I'll Be Here".   I really wished it was longer, but that's life.

I would have liked to hear a few more songs from this CD.

Amazon review: This album is a total waste of time.  It is a well-made, but poorly played, CD.  I have played this CD over and over, yet it has never changed in any of the songs.   The music is repetitive and very "dumb".  The CD is overproduced and sounds like a million bucks.  The CD has a very "dumb" sound to it and never has a thought or feeling to it.  You can tell the band tried to make and interesting CD, but it does not come out right.  This CD is a waste of time and money.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I like the lyrics a lot.  And the overall theme is great.  The song describes the feeling of being happy and being sad.  It feels like a good song.

Amazon reviewer review:  This song is a lot more than just a blues song.  It's an anti-death penalty song, a song of hope, a song of happiness, a song to make you happy, to get you through the dark times, and to take away all pain and suffering.  It's a very positive song.  I'm glad I bought the CD.

Amazon reviewer review:"The Good Daughter" is a great song that is not only a blues song but is an anti-death penalty song as well.  It was originally written by Hank Thompson and recorded by Willie Dixon.  Many believe that he was influenced by Hank Thompson.  Bob Johnson, a bluesman, recorded the song.  Now, I know that I don't have the right to tell you what you should or shouldn't listen to.  That's your choice.  But, I am a fan.  I like Bob Johnson.  I respect him.  He is a great bluesman.  He is a man that is very close to the blues.  I am glad I bought this CD, and I am sad that I didn't buy it earlier.  I would have really liked to hear Bob Johnson sing this song.  I think that this is a great song.  It's very positive.  It's a song that will make you happy.  It will make you feel good.  It's about a woman who is in love with somebody else.  This song is very emotional.  I'm glad I bought the CD.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I have to say though that when it comes to the CD cover art, it really does not do this CD justice. At first I thought it was cool, but when you listen to this CD, you have to agree that it is kinda out there. I think they should have made a picture of the band instead of their logo.

I am not very knowledgeable on this subject, but from my point of view, I believe that this album is a mixture of the two albums that were released.

Amazon review: I am the son of a Baptist minister, and a devout Catholic. He taught me to love the Lord Jesus and the Catholic Church. I have been reading the Bible since the day I was born. My parents always tell me not to read the Bible, but I do. I am able to quote scripture and know the story of every one of the books. I have memorized all the words of the Bible. I believe that there is a time and place for everything. I am a very religious man, and I still love my parents, but I also love my friends. I have read every book written by every author. I am not trying to sound like an idiot, I am a very rational person. If you take the Bible at face value, it makes no sense. If you take all the stories told around it at face value, it makes no sense. If I am to take the Bible at face value, it makes no sense. I have read it over and over again, and I have found no point, no meaning to it. I don't take it at face value. I still love it. It is the inspiration of my life.

After the singing lessons, my son was really excited to watch the rest of the class. He seemed like he was enjoying himself, but it didn't seem to be really helping with his problem. I'm not sure if he was doing the exercises so he could get over his fears of singing, but I don't think it was helping.  I think it should have really gone into the exercises, and the teacher should not have just left after 30 minutes.  I will not buy this cd and will probably pass on the lessons.

It was a lot of fun.  I thought it was a good way to get her out of my head, and the CD was definitely worth it.  I will definately buy the CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of Thalia.  I love how she blends different genres, and makes it seem like you are just hearing the songs, but she is teaching you to sing.  I thought this was a great way to begin my son's Christmas.  I did not like that the singing exercises were very short.  However, the breathing tips were very good.  I did the exercises, but not the singing, and I thought I was going to like this class.  It was a long, but great, Christmas.  I will definately buy the song, and the CD.  I really like how she teaches you to sing.  I also thought it was a good way to start my son's Christmas.

Amazon review: For months I was looking for a way to get my son to listen to music.  I don't sing and I thought this would be a great way to start his Christmas.  The teacher, Cyney Davis did a great job.  She really made him feel like she cares.  She really listened to his responses.  The breathing exercises and the singing exercises were new and fun.  I think it would be nice to get him to practice before Christmas.  My son really enjoys music.  I will buy the CD and the song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been singing since I was a child.  I really like the breathing exercises.  I think that this is a great way to relax my son.  I don't think it is a good way to start Christmas.  My son is very difficult to get through the exercises.  It is a lot of work for a short time.  It is not the best way to get someone to open up.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Very disappointing.  I love the songs.  I hope they make a good CD.  I don't think this is the best way to learn to sing.  It is not a good way to get over fears.  It is not a good way to begin Christmas.  My son could not stand to sit still.  He kept jumping up and down and yelling.  He was not interested in anything.  I wish I had not bought this.  I will not

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I got this album in '92 when it came out.  I loved it.  I have never bought a CD from them since.  I don't know who to blame - the band or CD company.  They're just no good.  I could have gotten a full length in 4 years if I were a big fan of this group. They're not getting what they deserve.

Amazon review: It's just a bunch of bad music.  I have a lot of friends that really like them.  I don't.  I don't want to give it a review.

Amazon review : I'm not really a fan of the music.  Manhattan Transfer is a really bad band, and I hate to say that since they are one of my favorite bands.  I can't be in a band and not like them.  I'm not sure where the name of this band came from, but I don't like it.  The music is really bad, but the music is not what's bad about it.  I'm not sure why they're so popular, but they are.

Amazon review: I have always liked Manhattan Transfer's music.  I bought all their albums.  This is my first time with Tuxedo Junction.  I really liked it.  I think it's a better CD than I thought.  I bought this CD expecting something that would just be a bunch of bad music.  I loved it.  I hope they'll release an album or two.  I'm not sure what they'll put out next.  They need to not put out any more albums because they make bad music.

Amazon review: I've been listening to Manhattan Transfer for a long time.  I really enjoy their music, but I have to admit that they are not very good.  I've never purchased a CD from them before, but I will definitely be buying one after I finish listening to this one.  The music is really good,  but the songs just suck.  I would really like to hear some more good music from them.  I'm not sure what CD company they're with, but I don't like it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: This was my first CD by Meghan Trainor.  I liked most of her songs and I am glad she is putting out more music.  I thought this CD was very good, but I don't think I'll buy another album by her.  I would have to say this is one of her best CDs...but I would not recommend this.

Amazon review: I bought this CD a few weeks ago.  I have two favorite songs on this CD:  "Someday" and "Wrecking Ball".  I really enjoy the piano and vocals by Meghan Trainor.  The only thing I didn't like was the lyrics on the songs "Someday" and "Wrecking Ball".  I thought the lyrics were not very good and kind of cheesy, and I have to agree with the opinions that said they were not good lyrics.  I wish the songs would have been different (different meaning different lyrics).  I'm giving this a negative review because I'm not sure how I feel about the songs "Someday" and "Wrecking Ball".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just wish that Meghan Trainor would sing songs that are more like her songs.  I wish that she would sing more songs that are more like "Carry On" or "All About That Bass".  I think she is a great singer, but her voice needs to be a little more upbeat.  I wish that she would sing a song like "I Don't Wanna Play No Games" or "I Don't Wanna Play No Games" again.  I wish she would sing a song like "I Don't Wanna Play No Game" again.

It was so fun to hear her sing "All About That Bass".  I have been a fan of this artist since then and I have always been on the fence about buying her CD's.  But I like the songs on this album,  I feel they are very talented.  I think they are a good CD.  I have listened to all three albums and I have to say this is the best.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
