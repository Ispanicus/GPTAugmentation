Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I think this is a good CD, a good song called 'My Baby' (which is in my opinion one of the best songs on the album), but what I don't like about this CD is that I couldn't really understand what was coming out of the speakers.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

A:

It's a great song, but I don't think it's appropriate for worship in church. 
While it is a song of praise, it is also about judgement and condemnation. 

A:

I found a great song on a Christian website called "Christianity" (www.christianity.com/song/292925 ) that is just as good. 
It has the lyrics below. But I think it's better to just listen to the song in the video. 

               Let the worshipers arise.  Let the worshipers arise.
               Worship him with the spirit and reason;              
              Let him be the judge of the earth.              

             For he will give you to everything you’ve ever dreamed of.  

            Let the worship leaders arise.  Let the worship leaders arise.
            We are the worship leaders we are the worship leaders we are the worship leaders we are the worship leaders
            we are the worship leaders we are the worship leaders we are the worship  leaders we are the worship leaders we are the worship leaders we are the
            worship leaders we are the worship leaders we are the worship leaders we are

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review (1 review): I am not sure I have ever been this impressed with a Schubert collection. The set that I have on CD is not a collection of the standard Schubert sets. It contains several of the songs that are featured in the "Schubert" film on which he is played by the great actor, Jack Palance. The set is also a good compilation of Schubert songs, and in particular the songs that have been most often used as film songs. I also have a couple of the songs that were released on CD by the German label, Melodie-Verlag. The set is a fine set of songs that would be worth the purchase of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I was surprised when I heard the lyrics to the song "I am a daughter of the mountains."

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I was hoping to like it more, but I just don't like it.  I like her style of music and her voice.  But I just don't like her lyrics.  I don't know if it is her being a woman, or if it is just a personal thing, but I just don't enjoy the lyrics.  I don't know, maybe if you know her personally, you can understand how bad it is.

It's like I am having to go to a new school, and I have to start over.  I was hoping that I could like this more, or at least be able to listen to it more.  But alas, it's just not for me.  It is an easy listen, but it is far from a good listen.  And the only songs I can stand are the ones I have already listened to.  But I do like the song "I'm A Dreamer", and the song "Love Me Harder", which is a cover of the song by the Spice Girls.  It is a good song, but I can't stand the song.

I love Meghan's voice, and her music is great, but I just hate the lyrics, and the song is not my cup of tea.  I will give it the same 5 stars as I have for this, but I will be giving it a pass in the future.  I guess that means I will be giving it a pass all this time, and then I will give it a pass when I have a kid.  I guess that's what happens when you have kids.

The guy said he had bought this album a long time ago and even though the album was good, he was not impressed by it. He said it sounded like it was recorded with a tape recorder. I was able to look back in the albums section of the Amazon website, and he was right. The album was recorded on a cassette tape, not a CD, so it sounds really crappy on the cassette. I thought the record was on an old cassette tape that was probably used to record old music. I was not impressed with the album as this guy was. I will still give this album a chance, but I may not buy it again.

Amazon review: I am the author of the book, 'Punchestown: The Story of Ireland's Greatest Fairground'. One of the stories in the book took place at an old barn on the outskirts of the village of Punchestown. The book details how the old barn fell into disrepair and was eventually purchased by the local council.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the song and album for a long time, but this album is a bit of a disappointment. The album is very hard to get through. I had no problem understanding it, but the songs are only a few lines long. The songs are not that long and so are not that complex. There are 2 songs of two minutes each. Maybe the songs would have been better if they were shorter, but that is not the fault of the songs. I think the whole album is over-produced and the vocals are poor.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I love this band. I love the album. But I think as an artist you have to create something new. I think the problem with M-1 was that they just kept the same style from album to album. They sound the same no matter what song they are on. I think they should have made new music but I would have like to hear more from them like on "Livin' Large". I think they do great music, but I think their music is just being on the radio. I would like to see M-1 go back to their roots of live, and just make music. I think their music is good and if you listen to you tube you can find good music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is amazing! This is the first M1 album I really enjoy. I don't usually like folk, but this album is the first I've listened to that I truly enjoy. The first album was my favorite, but this one is just as good. It's a little more "pop" and "rock" oriented, but still has the good songs. I would recommend this album to any fan of M-1.

Amazon review: This is a great album. First of all it is great to see a band still play their own music. This is not a one man band. The lyrics are amazing. It is sad that M-1 has been so forgotten about. Now they have a chance to show everyone that they are back in style, and even better they will have a chance to make music they could be proud of. The only bad part about this album is that it is a little on the heavy side. The music is really good, but if you like more pop music, this album may not be for you.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: The album is a great collection of blues, but I have to say that, for my money, 'Don't You Forget About Me' is the best song on the release (which is saying a lot).  'Shake It Up' is also a great song, but the last song, 'The Last One' is a real winner.  The only real criticism I have for this cd is that the booklet is a bit thin.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Robert Johnson's music has been around for a very long time, but it was not until the late 60s that many of the songs were available in CD.  In the early 80s, his music was becoming more mainstream and he began to gain a large following.  This compilation contains all his hits, and is a great addition to any blues collection.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: The group has a great mixture of styles that they are able to utilize through their musical diversity. In my opinion, the most unique aspect of this album is the inclusion of a song called "Ally." It's a song that has a good, catchy hook, but also an excellent verse. The lyrics to "Ally" are pretty much the same as "What a Wonderful World" because they are both about the joys of love, but this time, the song goes a little bit deeper. This is a great album.

Amazon review: I think this is one of the best songs in the whole discography of Danzig.  The lyrics are great, the music is great, and it's a great song.  It's not the type of song that gets you to dance because it's not a song you'd listen to while you're dancing.  I've heard it several times and I just like it.  There's a high-pitched female voice over the top of the male voice.  It sounds like it's in the middle of the song and sometimes it's in the background.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I'm not complaining; I love the  songs.  But it's not the best album by any means.  It's not bad; but it's not the best.  It's fine; but it's not the best.

I went into the store and bought the cd.  The store clerk was a little scared and I would tell him what I wanted and he would tell me that he didn't have the cd.  I was so happy.  I told him I would wait and when he came back he was carrying the cd.  He told me that he could not find it and he told me he lost it.  I was so happy.  I

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I really don't like those slow songs that have long guitar parts.  I like the ones that have a fast guitar part and then a nice verse then a bridge.  This one just sounds like a boring slow song.

I have heard a lot of songs on this cd that I may have only heard on the radio, but many of them I have never heard before.  I love the song "I Love You" by the Beatles because it hits you over the head with a great message and it is just an awesome song.  "I'm Sorry" by the Beatles is awesome.  I like the song "Just a Little Bit" because its just a great tune.  "The Greatest Love of All" is just a great song.  I like the song "I've Got a Problem" by the Beatles because its a great song and well sung.  The song "You're Not Alone" by the Beatles is awesome.  I like the song "Funny Boy" because it hits you over the head with a great message.  I like the song "In My Dreams" because it hits you over the head and it is a little creepy.  I like the song "I've Got a Problem" because it hits you over the head and it is a little creepy and it has a great message.  "A Time for Love" has a great message and it is a little creepy.  I love the music I have heard so far and will continue to buy the album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This CD is not very good. When I listen to it, it sounds like it was recorded in a very low speed (not the stereo recording, I know), with the result that the dynamics are very low, and the sound is very soft. The sound is a little better than the average performance of the same piece, but not good enough to recommend it to anyone. It is just not as good as the performances of other Brahms records.  The recording is not very good, and the performance is not very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wanted to buy this album, but I am not happy with it.  It was recorded with many different instruments at different speeds and with no dynamic range.  The voices are not very clear, and there are a lot of problems with the recording.  I do think it is a very good and pleasant recording.  I don't think it is a very good album by Brahms, but it is a good recording.  I think that it is an album that I should buy, because it is so good and pleasant to listen to.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this band. I've been a fan since 1984. They have the best music and the best sound. I think that a lot of the newer music is too "pop" or "radio" sounding and doesn't have the same feel as the first two albums.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first two albums, "Rapture" and "Oasis", are awesome, but I am enjoying the  '99 release, 'A World To Win'. I would rate 'A World To Win' higher than the other two. The songs are so diverse, spanning from heavy metal to  pop/rock.  There are so many great songs on this disc that you would even think you  could play them all.  This is the type of music that I would love to play in my backyard.  The songs are so upbeat and have a cool feel to them. 'A World To Win' will definitely get some airplay, and get my band some airplay, which in turn will get some more fans. As far as the band goes, I am getting more and more of the old members (i.e. bass, drums, and guitar).  This will help bring the sound to the fans again. I have been waiting for this band to come back and continue the "new" sound. I wish they would bring back the "old" members as well.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: For those wondering what the difference is between  their new CD and the two older ones, I think it boils down to the originality of the songs...I love the new songs, but don't think "A World to Win" is better than the two older ones.

Amazon review: So, this is the third CD that I've bought off the band's label.  The first two were a little dull, but the new CD is a little more interesting and creative.  I'm not a fan of the band's old style.  I like the songs that they're doing on this CD.  The band is still good, and I do like the songs that they are doing.  They're just so different from the ones that I have been listening to or playing in my band.  The new songs are good, but they still aren't that good.  The new songs sound even better, but the old ones still sound cool.  I'm sure it will improve with time, but right now I don't think they're that good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this is a great CD, and the band is back.  I'm glad to see that they are putting more time into the release.  The songs are diverse and interesting, and I expect the CD will continue to be good.  I love the new songs, but I just can't get into the old ones.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: As a fan of the band, I am excited to see that they are still going.  I am very glad that I got out the first two albums.  They were really good.

Amazon review: I love it.  It is the third CD by this awesome band that I've bought.  The first two were very good, but the new one is more in my opinion.  The band just needs to keep the same energy and passion that they had when they were first starting out.  After having bought the cd already, I'm going to buy more so I can get every song.  This is the best cd to buy that I have had so far.  I'm very glad that I bought this one.  I can't wait to buy the next CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves this type of music.
