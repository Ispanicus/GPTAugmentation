Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I really like this artist. She makes me want to dance like a fool. She's the best! I had heard about this album but didn't get a chance to listen to it. I was so happy to hear it's good. I'm not a huge fan of pop but I love her music. I was so excited to listen to it and was bummed when I heard they never made it to the U.S.

Amazon review: I love this track! I have listen to it over and over and over again. It's so catchy and has such a great message. I really didn't enjoy the CD though. The songs are great but I wish that they took a different way to express their love for each other. It would have been better if they just said how much they loved each other. I wish they had just listened to the lyrics, which were so good.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of pop but I love this artist. I've been on the fence about buying her CD's for a while and I finally decided to buy one. I thought it was awesome. I'm not much of a fan of pop but I am a huge fan of Meghan Trainor. I really like her CD's. Her music is so unique and she is really good at what she does. I had the opportunity to listen to the CD and I was actually surprised at how good it was. I had to take a break between songs a few times because I was laughing so hard. Her fans had to tell her that it was so funny, lol. I really like her music and I think that she is a really talented artist. I really hope that her CD's are more popular in the U.S.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not the accapella. This is labeled incorrectly. I purchased it because someone else wrote that it was in fact the accapella but that is not true.

Amazon review: The album starts with a bang (not that the band needed to start with a bang) with a song that is just all over the place. Not one song is what I would call traditional country, but there is a lot of energy, a lot of great lyrics and a lot of great guitar work (and a few good vocal performances), but it is a bit too much at times. There is also the problem that the lyrics are not always the best, but that is not even the main reason for me to not like this album. The main reason is that there are too many songs that don't stand out enough to be memorable or to make me want to buy an album. And I have to say that this is not the first time that I have been disappointed in a Twiztid album. The first one was called F**k You, Twiztid and the second one was called Sucka, Twiztid because they couldn't write decent songs (but really that just means that they couldn't write good songs) and then they decided that they were going to change their name back to TWIZTID. I mean really, is there any way that you can just change the name of a band and not change the name of the name of your entire record collection? And that is why I am kind of pissed off with this album. I was really looking forward to this album, but I am not expecting anything to be outstanding. I was hoping that there would be a song that I like more than the others, but the fact is that each song is a little different. And I don't know if the problem is that I only liked one or two of them, but I really don't know. I can't say that I like all of them, but they are so damn good that it would be impossible to dislike all of them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is what is known as "country-tinged" music. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of variety in the music. I guess there is no good reason for Twiztid to change their name. They don't seem to have any other songs that can stand out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The band was amazing and I was more than pleased with their third album. They don't really seem to have the best songs on the album, but it is still a solid album (maybe not as solid as their previous two albums). The album is a little bit of everything and is a little over-produced, but I still recommend it. It is not the greatest album by Twiztid, but it is still a good one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of Twiztid since their previous album (F**k you, Twiztid). Each time I have been lucky enough to hear them play live. This album will be a return to the form that they have been in. I still do not like the song "F**k You Twiztid" but the rest of the album is pretty good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is not up to the level that I expected for the band. They have a nice musical style that they have shown some talent in the past. Unfortunately, this album has the same problem that the rest of the band has had. They try to do a lot of things and they fail to do any of them well. I would recommend this album for people who enjoy a good country / hip hop / rap / pop / blues type of sound. I would not recommend this album to people who like the twangy sound of the band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album has a very different sound from the band's previous album. I am not sure if this is a positive or a negative review. I personally would not recommend this. If you like their previous albums you will probably enjoy this album. On the other hand, if you don't like their previous albums this album may not be for you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know what the deal is with Twiztid. I know that they changed their name to Twiztid and that they are trying to do a country band. I have never been a huge fan of twangy country songs, but I was really excited to find out that Twiztid was not going to be twangy. If they had really gone with their new name, all of those problems would have been gone. In this album they have some good songs, but the only ones I like are the ones that they made up on their own.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I've had my eye on this artist for awhile now.  I've been listening to his music for a couple of years now.  This is one of his better albums.  The first three tracks are great.  The next three are ok, but the last two are not good, but not as bad as they sound on the album.

Amazon review: The band and the songs are great.  You get to hear this guy in his element on this album, not in his comfort zone.  This is the kind of music that makes you want to get up and dance.

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I am a music teacher in a private school in Ohio.  My students love my music and are very proud of me for my choice of music in the classroom.  My son wanted to purchase the cd, but then I thought about his teachers.  I decided to let him purchase it a few days after the sale ended.  I then went to the school to let them know what I had done for him.  They were very excited to hear that I was giving my son this CD, and that he had the choice to purchase it or not.  They also gave me the choice to purchase it a few days after it was sold out.  I also feel this is a great time to give it away to all my friends who don't have a music teacher.  I had 2 or 3 students who told me they would give me money so I could buy a copy of it.  I decided to let them have the copy so I could give it to my son.  I am happy to report, that all of my students enjoyed the cd and were very impressed with their teacher.  It is also a great gift for my son.

Amazon review: I've always been a fan of Lin-Manuel-Miranda's work. I've seen him in concert, at the Kennedy Center, etc., but this CD is what really makes me realize how good he is. Each song is so different from the next, and for many of them, it's like they have a completely different song just for you. It's like a one-take performance. The songs range from hip-hop to ballads to rock to ballads to rap, and the vocals are fantastic. "I did it for you" is the sweetest song I've ever heard. "You're a star" has a great hook, and the song itself is a fantastic pop/rock ballad. The rest of the songs are all excellent, from "I'm Still Standing" to "I'm A Man", to "America" to "The Girl in the Cafe.", to "All the Stars", to "I Do", which I've already mentioned, and which is awesome. Although I've never seen Lin-Manuel-Miranda perform live, this CD gives me goose bumps, and I highly recommend it.

Amazon review: In a sense I feel bad for Lin-Manuel-Miranda because he was only able to write a few songs.

His voice is so strong and versatile and I wish he had more songs.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review:  I like the band name, but when I go to listen to their music on my iPod, I cannot listen to their songs.  When I go to watch them perform live I cannot listen to their music. It is frustrating.  I have to go the other way.  On their website, they have a list of their songs, but when I click on the song that I want to listen to, it opens up a pop-up that basically says I am not allowed to listen to this song, and I am not allowed to download it.  The only way I can download the song is if I go to iTunes and go to the "Download" tab and click on the song I want to download, then the song will be downloaded, but I cannot play it on my iPod.  I want to listen to all their songs.  I have downloaded their songs to my iPod and I love them, but I just find it frustrating when they won't let me listen to them.  I don't know why they don't let you listen to the songs?  It is kind of like having a CD that has the whole album but when you go to listen, you have to go to another computer to listen to the album.  It's kind of like a double-edged sword with this album.

It would be very annoying to have an iPod and not be able to listen to these songs.  I also have a hard time listening to the songs that I downloaded because of the pop-up they have on their website, but I can listen to some of their songs if I go to the iTunes store and click on the song I want to listen to, but then I can't listen to it on my iPod.  I can't understand why they won't allow you to listen to their songs if you want to download them to your iPod.  I understand they need to protect their copyrights and stuff, but they should let you listen to their songs on your iPod.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It was hard not to start singing along with the lyrics, I just couldn't help myself.  It really is a great album and there are a lot of different songs.  I love The Lyrics, and there are so many great ones that were left off the album that I thought I should mention them.                I must say that this is by far, the best mixtape I have ever listened to.  They only come out with one or two songs at a time, so you get to hear them all, you get to hear new tracks, and you get to hear songs that I have never heard before.              The only things I don't like are the fact that the last song is a song about Madrox and that the second song has the lyrics "I'm a mother-f*cking monster" which is just plain stupid.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a very good album, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  I would suggest that you get the first two songs on the first disc.  By the way, the title of this album is a reference to the "Twizted" album, which is also a great album.

Amazon review: This is the worst rap album I have ever heard.  The album is only about 2-3 tracks long.  There are 5 different types of rapping styles, and no real rhyming schemes.  This is a mess.  The beats are really good, but the rapping is awful and uninteresting.              This album is not even worth listening to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's not that bad.  It is an album, however, that I have heard many times.  It's just that this is the first time I have heard it in its entirety.

I would recommend this to anyone because it's just that good.

Amazon review: This is a great album. I heard about this album from my friend, who was a fan of the music and rap.  I was curious and decided to check it out.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I have been playing some of it on the CD player in my car and it sounds great. I have been listening to it for about 5 days now and i can't stop listening to it. I love the songs on this cd.

Amazon review: I have purchased several albums from here, both cd and dvd, and was very pleased. I have been a fan of Johnny Cash for many years, and I have always been disappointed with his CD releases because he does not play the songs in the proper order. Now, I have finally found him and I am very impressed. Not only did the songs appear in the proper order, but when listening to the cd I was completely oblivious to the fact that the songs were in a different order. This cd is excellent in my opinion. This cd is worth every penny you paid for it. I will purchase another cd from you. Keep up the good work.

It is the most beautiful, and most well put together cd I have ever heard. I hope that you may see a lot of success from this cd, because it is worth every penny you paid for it.

Amazon review: I had never heard the "Johnny Cash and Friends" cdr. until I saw this review. I thought, "man, I can't believe I am buying this album at such a low price." My only problem was that I had been considering getting the "Big Boss Man" cdr. and I didn't want to pay the $19.99. I guess I have to accept the fact that it wasn't worth the $19, but I still want to get this cdr. I really like the CD and I feel that it is worth it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I know Lin Manuel Miranda has such a great, memorable voice, and he's a talented composer and performer as well.  And he has a great voice, but these songs just aren't for me.

Amazon review: I give this album 2 out of 5 stars.  The first thing I noticed and the thing that really made me not listen to this album was when I noticed that they were using the same vocals on this album as they used on their last album.  The vocals really do not match up to the production.  This second album still isn't bad as far as I am concerned, I just don't like the vocals.  The next thing that really made me not listen to this album is when they used the same production tricks on each of the songs.  The whole album has this "electronic" feel to it, the beats of the instruments don't change much.  I also don't like the production of the chorus of "I'm a G.O.A.T., Fuck My Life" because they sound exactly the same in the chorus each and every time.  The last thing I didn't like about the album is when they used the same production tricks on the song "Lemon."  The song uses the same beat, the same production, the same vocal chords and the same instrumentation.  This is something that I don't like and the production of the song doesn't really match up to the other songs.  The last thing I didn't like about this album was the last song "Lemon."  The song is too fast for my taste and it is just not believable.  The only thing that I do like about this album is the song "I wanna fuck your momma."  I feel like the last guy that used the line "if you don't eat your dinner, I'll eat your ass" should be on the "O.C." not the "T.O.P.".

Amazon review: I am a huge Twiztid fan.  They were one of the very first people I added to my radio while I was in college.  I am not a fan of this particular album, I don't like that the production isn't as good as the other songs.  The vocals are still great, but I felt like I didn't like them as much as the other songs.  I really like that they are using the same production tricks on each of the songs, I can't really think of any other way that they could have used the production tricks that they did on this album.  The only thing that I can say I like about this album is that it is fun to listen to.  The production is amazing and the songs are very well done.  I really like how the production tricks don't change much on each song.  I really can't think of any other way they could have used the production tricks that they did on this album.

Amazon review: This is a new release on the label and I am really excited to hear it.  I am going to give it more attention than I have so far.  I like the production of the songs, the production is amazing on every song.  The vocals are great, but I do have to give the vocals a lot of negative points because I really don't like the vocals as much as I like the other songs.  The production tricks and the vocals don't really match up on this album.  The production on this album doesn't change much, I don't think they needed to change anything because the vocals don't match up to the other songs.  The instrumentation is great on every song.  The vocals on this album are very weak.  I don't know how the vocals are in my CD player, but this is definitely a weak vocal album.  I did enjoy the first two songs, the first two songs are the best songs, but the vocals on the last two songs are really weak.  If you compare this album with the first album, you will hear a huge difference.  The first album sounds better and has a better production.  The instrument

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

I like the variety of the styles that they feature.  I was particularly impressed with the songs that feature the soloists' voices.  I like the variety that is shown on this CD and I think it will be a great addition to my CD collection.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
