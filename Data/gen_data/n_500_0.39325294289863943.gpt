Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: This was the first CD I bought for my children. We listened to it together on their first night awake after being placed in the hospital for a week. I was pleased to see a recording of the show that was in their original language, but the CD was in English. I was especially pleased to see the recording of "El Hombre De La Mancha" for the first time. I had never heard that song performed in English. It was performed in a very theatrical manner that was beautiful and very moving. This was the first time I had seen the "Carmen" and "Don Quixote" recordings on CD and was pleased to see them both on CD. This was a special Christmas gift from my parents to my children and was worth the $30 US price tag.

Amazon review: I have read many of the reviews, and in my opinion, some of them are unfair. If the recording is cut short, then that is how the recording is to be, and that is not a problem. I have watched many people cut their recordings, and the reason is most of them were very short. The reason people cut their recordings short is because they are tired of hearing the same old song every night.

This is a great band, they had a good time doing it!! They also played during the 4th of July parade in the parade and they played for New Year's Eve!! They played for the parade as well as the New Years. They played for the Parade, the Concert, and the Super Bowl. They have a new gig and are playing at a new location.

All I can say is that this band is really good!!! The band is called "The Haggans" and they play a great live show!

After the show they took a picture with the band and then danced with them like crazy. I think they were having a blast!

The band is an "old school" band that is from the 80's/90's! The band is fun and has a great sound!

If you are into alternative music and have a great time doing it, then this band is for you!

This is a great album for the year of the hog. This is the kind of music I like to listen to while watching the hog. The band is great!

If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I did not like it because I was looking for LP not single. Anyways, I sent it back and I was quickly processed for money return. It was needing more information on the add.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with previous reviewer.  I was looking for a good sound for relaxation, and this was not very relaxing at all.  If you're looking for a relaxing sound, go to Soundtrack or Soundbuds.  I didn't really like it and I'm not sure I will buy it, but I would probably buy it if it were a single.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this and have been using it for about 3 weeks since I got it and it's doing its job.  I was getting tired of the sound of my favorite soundtracks and I've already bought a couple of the soundtracks in the set.  It's a very nice set for someone who is on the go and wants to listen to a variety of different songs at the same time.  The collection of sounds is interesting and it covers a lot of genres.  I'm in a hurry and I like that the collection is not organized by genre, so I can keep track of what I like and what I don't like.  I also like that the collection is not organized by song title, but by play count.  I can quickly find the tracks that I like at a glance.  The collection is also organized by mood, which I like.  I like that this collection has all the sounds to help me get in the right mood for a particular recording.  It's convenient and the sounds are relaxing and relaxing.  I don't have a lot of time for relaxation so this is great.  I am sure that it would be great if I had more time for relaxing, but I'm not a music guy.  I would recommend this to music lovers or people who like to listen to background music when doing something else.  I like it, but I'm not sure I would buy it again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like the idea of this set but would not buy it.  I was looking for a "new" collection of sounds just like the one that I had before.  This one is much smaller and has only 22 sounds.  I have a problem with that.  I have a collection of 44 sounds (that would be 44 times 6 sounds) and I don't have the same sounds that I have had before.  The sounds that I have don't make sense anymore.  They are not the same as in the first collection.  I feel that the differences in sounds are not as great as they were before.  When I listen to the sounds that I have now, the difference between sounds that I have, and the sounds that I used to have is so huge.  It does not sound like the sounds I used to have.  I like the idea of having a collection of sounds and having them organized in a set.  However, my problem is that this collection does not reflect the sounds that I used to have before.  It seems to me that the sounds that I have are not that different.  I don't like to have a collection that is not organized by sound.  There is no way to tell what the sounds in this collection sound like.  It does not sound like any of the sounds that I have.  I don't know what I am supposed to get from this set.  It does not sound like the sounds I have.  It does not sound like the sounds I have now.  I think that this set is designed to make the listener lose interest in what they are listening to.  For example, I would not buy the set if I could use it for relaxation.  I am not a music lover so I don't like to listen to music for relaxation.  The sounds that I like for relaxation are relaxing, but the sounds that I like for music are not relaxing.  I would not buy a set that only has 22 sounds.  I would not buy a set that only has 22 sounds.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought it because this is a "new" collection of sounds that I was looking for.  My problem was that they did not have the same sounds as the ones I had.  If I had the same sounds that I had before, and organized them in the same way, then I would not have had any problems.  I am not a music lover so I don't like listening to music for relaxation.  I would not buy this set if I could use it for relaxation.  I am not a fan of relaxation so it would never be a good idea for me to have this set.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been using this set for about 3 weeks now and I love it!  I had a lot of trouble getting through the sounds.  It is very different than the sounds I had.  I have been listening to music since I was a child.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

She is very popular in the industry and is being used in movies and tv shows, but I just cannot get invested in her music.

Amazon review: When I first heard this album I thought it was the best hip-hop album ever.  Now, I think it is just average.

There are a couple of songs that I like on this album.  But most of the songs have been disappointing.  The songs are average but at least there are some good songs on this album.  They are the ones that give the album the feel of being a "classic" hip-hop album.

Amazon review: The only negative thing I can say about this album is how short the songs are.  Some of the songs are very long, but the others are very short and make the album less good.

There are some very good songs on this album, but I just don't like the album as a whole.

I have listened to this album 8 or 9 times.  I can't really name any bad tracks, but there are a couple of songs that I like, but they are mostly filler.  There are also a couple of songs that I don't like, but I have to listen to them to find out why.  I just don't listen to much hip-hop, so I am not used to the style, and the beats in hip-hop aren't my favorite.  So, I am not sure what to say here.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very simple song which could have been left out on "Dope" however it is the only song that can be used as an encore for a very good reason.  The song is a simple song but I love the way it is put together.  I think the song could have been better but it won't bother me.  The song is great.  Lenny Kravitz delivers a great performance.  2 stars.

Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz's most recent album is "Kravitz" and if you've been listening to the CD, you know he is really good.  Kravitz' voice is very distinct and when he sings I listen closely.  This is the best song on the CD.  It is a simple song with a beautiful melody and a catchy chorus.  I have to give it a rating of 4 stars because it is a good song but other than that, there are plenty of songs on the album that are better.  2 stars.

Amazon.com Review:

What does it say about a musician when the album where they perform their music is actually very good and the songs that are actually recorded are not?  I mean, where's the bad stuff?  I'm not saying Lenny Kravitz isn't talented, nor that he doesn't have a voice that is unique to him and he has a way with words that speaks to people in a way that is very special.  Kravitz does have a way with words and he can sing them with an incredible ability to turn up the excitement in a song.  The album is called Kravitz and the album cover is fantastic.  I will say that Kravitz does have a tendency to give songs a very repetitive feel and this song does not do anything to change that feeling.  I found out that I would have to give this a rating of 3 stars because it is a good song.  It is a good song that is not too repetitive and the lyrics are well written.  I could see this song fitting in with his other songs on the album.  The song isn't bad and if you are a fan of his, you will enjoy this song.  It is not a bad song and I don't think anyone can hate a song by Lenny Kravitz.  I've always loved Kravitz and I think he is one of the greatest singers not only in the country, but all over the world.  You can tell that he is a singer who doesn't get too much credit for his talent and he is truly a unique singer.  The song "Do You Love Me?" is a good song and I will give it a rating of 3 stars simply because of the repetitive nature of the song.  The song is fine and the songwriting is good.  Kravitz does have a way with words and I think that is what makes him one of the best singer in the world.  The song is a little repetitive, but it is a good song and I will give it a rating of 3 stars.

Lenny Kravitz's song "Do You Love Me?" is a good song, but it's a little repetitive and that's not a problem.
