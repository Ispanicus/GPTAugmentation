Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: this album is a definite step down from the previous one. it sounds as though the band was trying to be as successful as possible with their first album. however, i do like it. it has a good mix of old and new songs with a good mix of styles.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Is it just me or does this album sound more like the other two albums?  It's not bad, but it's not great.  I didn't even notice all the overdubs and string arrangements until I started to listen to it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album, but it just doesn't cut it.  I've always liked Robert Johnson, even more than the first two albums (but this one is a no-brainer), but this just feels like a big step down from their previous albums in the past... or maybe just a step up.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The lyrics are all over the place, to the point where I'm not sure if I heard what I think I heard.  I would say that this album is a little better than the last two, but I still don't like it.  I'll give it another listen after my son finishes school, and I'll do a review after I've listened to the rest of the songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I was very disappointed with this album... I like the older stuff but this album just seemed too much like the other two.  The first two albums are great, just not very good.

Amazon review: I have to say after listening to this album, I was really disappointed in it as well.  I like the songs and think they're very good, but the band just sounded way too generic to me.  I don't know how else to describe it, it just seems like an old folk band trying to sound "new".  I wouldn't say this album is a complete step down, but it doesn't stand out or stand out to me in the same way the other two albums did.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this band.  They have a way of delivering great songs and a very good music.  I really want to hear some of their old songs, especially their first two albums.  I have the cd in my car at home and will get to it soon.

Amazon review:  I loved the first two albums, but this third one just sounded like more of the same.  I didn't like the songs, but I didn't dislike them either.  The lyrics were alright, but as I said before, they were a little too generic to me.

Amazon review: I don't know what's happened to this band...  I like the first two albums, but this one just seems a little more generic.  I don't know why the band is playing this stuff for people to hear, but I guess that's why they are going to the big venues.  I just wish they would stop using the same instrumentation and same vocalists (as you can see on the last two albums) and just do something different.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is not a bad album.  It's not great either, but it has its own sound and different from the other two albums.  I love these guys and they deserve a little more credit than they are getting.  I wish them the best of luck in the future, I'm not expecting them to be a huge success, but I think they should try to push themselves to be better and to get one more album done.  I like the first two albums much better than this one.  I think it's time for them to change their style.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I bought this album for the same reason I bought the other two (but that's a different reason), and this time I got it.

I don't know why they are playing these songs for everyone to hear, but I guess that's why they are playing them in the big venues.  I don't know how else to describe it, it just sounds like

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I enjoy the songs I don't enjoy the songs that I don't like.  So I listened to them all, then I listened to some of the other ones and decided to write a review.  The best thing about this cd was the songs that I didn't know anything about.  I like to be surprised, and this cd was a nice surprise.  The best thing about the cd is the music, I have never heard much music like this, and I have listened to a lot of music.  I don't listen to much new music, but this CD is a big improvement over some of the other cd's I have heard.

Amazon review: When my wife and I were out with friends at a local bar, a guy walked in with a little kid and began to dance.  He was moving his hips and shaking his arms and pointing at me and my wife.  I looked at my wife and said, "Who is this guy?"  My wife said, "You don't know him?"  The man said, "No he's my brother."  I said, "He's not your brother."  We left the bar and decided to go to his house.  I knocked on the door, he opened, and I said, "Hi.  My name is Joe, and I work for you."  He looked at me and said, "Who are you?"  I said, "Joe, I work for you."  He said, "I don't know you."  We walked in the house, and he said, "I don't know you."  We sat down.  He said, "You don't know me, and you don't know anything about me."  I looked him in the eye and said, "I am your brother!"  He said, "I am your brother."  We sat down, and he said, "You don't know me, and you don't know nothing about me."  I said, "I am your brother!"  He said, "I'm your brother!"  I said, "We're brothers, and we've been through a lot.  I love you, and I'll always love you, and you love me, and we are going to be together."  He said, "I'll see you later, I'll be here when you get home."  I said, "I'll be here, you're my brother."  He said, "I don't know you, I don't know nothing about you, you don't even have a real brother, you're the only one I have."  We sat down and he said, "You don't know me, and you don"t know nothing about me."  I said, "I am your brother, and I'll always be your brother, and I will always be here for you, and I'll always be here for you."  He said, "You don't know me, and you don"t have a real brother because there is no such thing as a real brother, you're the only one I have.  I said, "I am your brother, and I will always be your brother, you love me, and I love you, and one day we will be together."  He said, "I will see you later, I will be here when you get home."

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I love that the music is not loud and rambly and that the songs really reflect their feelings.  I love that the songs have a strong flow and that the lyrics have a strong message.  I love the sound of the album and the way it flows.  I love the fact that there is not one song on the album that does not have a message of love, kindness, or happiness.  I love the fact that they are not a pop band and that I can easily tell that this band is influenced by people like Merle Haggard, Bob Dylan, and Johnny Cash.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I really didn't like the album, I thought it was okay, I have heard a lot of albums before, but this is the worst album I have heard,  there is so many songs that I could go into detail in my review, but I will just say for now that this is the worst sound I have ever heard,  I would not buy another album from this artist,  I would not even buy another album off of the artist,  just not worth my time,  I would get a new computer and just listen to music,  I would not buy this album and I will not listen to the rest,  I would rather listen to a different artist,  I would rather listen to a completely different artist,  I would rather listen to a different artist,  I would not buy this album and the rest of the album was just a waste of time.

Amazon review: The only song that really caught my attention was 'Let The Worshipers Arise'    it was a well written song and the lyrics were really catchy and the music was also great,  it was an uplifting song with a positive message,  very well done,  very well sung,  I would have to say that this is one of the better Christian albums that I have heard,  not bad at all,  it just took me a long time to get into it,  I will just have to wait for the next one to come out to get back in the groove of it,  I just do not feel that I could handle the older stuff that I have listened to in the past,  this is a very good album,  I will have to wait for the next one to come out to get back into it,  I just do not feel that I could handle the older songs that I have heard in the past,  I would have to get another new computer to listen to the ones that I have already listened to,  I would just be listening to the same songs over and over again,  it just would be a waste of my time,  I would rather listen to a different artist,  I would prefer listening to another artist,  I would prefer listening to another artist,  just not worth my time,  I would rather listen to another artist,  I just do not feel that I could handle the older stuff,  this is a very good album,  I would have to get another new computer to listen to the songs that I have already heard,  I would just be listening to the same songs over and over,  I would just be listening to the same songs over and over and over again,  it just would be a waste of my money,  I would rather listen to a different artist,  I would just be listening to the same songs over and over.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have to agree with those who say this is not a good album.  The vocals are terrible,  there is no singing.  The music is not very good.  My niece who is a teacher told me to buy this album so I could listen to it at home and then return it when she was done with it.  I did it this time,  I bought it and I listened to it for about 3 hours  until I just couldn't take it anymore.  After I finished the CD I took it to the local record store and they told me they had sold out.  I was so upset because I was really excited to listen to it.  I hope those who were excited will not regret buying this CD.  It was really hard for me to listen to it.  I will not buy it again since I have already listened to it once.  It's just a shame most of the songs I liked are gone.  I am sorry I wasted my money on this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Good song. I listened to this when I was a kid, and hearing it again really brought back memories. Was afraid it was not going to hold up in these days, but it's still like I remembered.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Meh. Didn't really live up to the expectations. Could have been better.

Amazon review: This album is fantastic and if you enjoy musical theater, it should be an excellent treat for you. The music is so well done and the arrangements and instrumentation are very well done. The choral singing is also very good.  I was really surprised that the vocal group was not as good as the choral singing.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like the music and this CD's cover is really nice.  I've heard an album called Choral Music and it was really good.  It has a lot of great singers, but this one is not really as good as it could've been.  I did like the CD's cover.

Amazon review: It's a great album.  It's kind of surprising, but I do like the music, and the arrangement and singing are really good.  I was really disappointed with the CD, though.  The choir singing is quite good.  The choral singing is good.  I wanted to like this CD, but the lyrics and concept of the CD are just not very appealing to me.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: New songs by Meghan Trainor and I'm not impressed.  I was disappointed that the songs weren't as new sounding as the first few tracks, but then again there is a reason it took 10 years to make her first album. The lyrics are good and the melody is beautiful. I liked the overall sound, but I don't think any of Meghan's songs can live up to the original.  I don't think they're any better or any worse than those written by another musician.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first CD that Meghan Trainor has ever recorded.  So I thought it was a great idea to buy it.  I had high hopes for the CD, but they were soon dashed.  I'm just not a fan of her style, but that is just my opinion. I thought the songs were well written and the singing was good.  But I just don't think I could listen to it one more time.

I found this group when I went to Tuxedo Junction in the summer of 2006.  I knew I had to find a group that could sing good and play good, so I searched the web for a few years and found many groups.  Finally, I found this group.  I have been singing with them for about three years and I can't wait to sing with them again.  I love them.  They are extremely talented and really good at playing and singing.  They are awesome!

I love Tuxedo Junction and I love this group.  The singing and playing are amazing.  It's just like playing with a band.  I am not the greatest singer, but I know how to play.  I can't wait to go back to T

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I have been waiting for this cd for several years. I was looking for the CD one where Mr. LMM sang with his own voice. The other cd's I have listened to are either from the LMM or PTL. This new CD is a must have. It is very full and has a wonderful sound. I have listened to this album for almost 3 weeks now and I love the new songs. It has new songs that I haven't heard in a long time. I think it is one of the most complete albums that LMM has released because there are so many songs and so many different styles. The songs are all very good. The only problem I have with this album is that there is one song that is missing. If you don't mind the other songs, this cd is fantastic.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The new album by Twiztid is the most depressing thing I've ever heard.  Their previous albums were extremely solid and this one feels like they have no direction.  They are just rambling on and on, not very different then the "I'm so happy I'm so happy, I'm so happy I'm so happy I'm so happy" that I hear when I listen to their other albums.

Amazon review: I don't really dig Twiztid at all and this song wasn't at all what I expected.  The chorus is not even close to what they do in the rest of the song.  I just don't understand people loving this band so much.  The vocals aren't bad, but the lyrics are just annoying.  I wouldn't blame people for not giving them a chance, but I would blame them for not giving the rest of their albums a chance.  This is a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was a big Twiztid fan from the moment they came out.  From the opening blast of their music, it was almost as if it was just a continuation of the last album.  I thought that they came out with a new sound to add to their already great body of music.  I was wrong.  It is like they decided to take the same song and put it on "two" different albums.  I don't know how long they have been doing this, but it is just too much.  I don't know though, I'm only 19...
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I hate that they are releasing another song about killing people - and killing them - and then in the back cover on the back cover - under the title "This is my war..." they talk about how they will start killing people in the next song.  They sound like they are saying "we're the real Twiztid".  This album is a real waste of time.  What is there to say about the songs?  They are all just repetitive.  I don't know what they are trying to do with this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm still a huge Twiztid fan and I'm really disappointed to see this new album.  Every song is just repeating the same thing over and over.  I can't believe they are doing another album.  They just sound so fake and fake sounding.  Even the video for their new album for the video is just a rehash of the music video for their last album.  I'm not a fan of Twiztid at all and I don't really understand why anyone else would like them.

Amazon review: Twiztid's new album is the worst album in existence.  It's not even good, just bad.  They just repeat the same song over and over.

They are just a bunch of weirdos.

Amazon customer review: I have been listening to "The Great Escape" album (in chronological order) since my boyfriend and I first discovered it.  The first time I bought it was when we were dating and I was very scared to try it because I had never listened to rock 'n roll before.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the western genre. The music is generally very well done, but this recording is just awful.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my wife's birthday to show her how great western music can be. I have listened to it several times and the sound is so terrible that the only thing that keeps me from putting it on the trash can is the fact that I don't want to leave the CD as is. This is not a bad recording, but a very poor one.

Amazon review: I have been looking for the right recording of the western music. I am not sure what I was expecting, but I thought it would be some of the greatest western music ever played, and maybe even a live recording of songs like "The Ballad of Bronco Billy". It turns out that the recording is a lot of cowboys playing music, but it has a lot of things that were not in the original recordings. For example, there is no sound of a drum. There is no sound of a fife. There is no sound of a guitar. There is no sound of a brass section. There is no sound of a band. What there is are just cowboys playing music. The only thing that keeps me from throwing it out is the fact that I really love the music, and I would rather have a great recording of the music that I really love than a mediocre recording of the music that I like. I was very disappointed in the recording, and I don't think that you should waste your money on it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am only giving the CD a rating of 3 stars, because I really like the music, and I think that it is a very good CD.

It is a great piece of American history.

I am not sure why I bought it, but now I don't care.

Amazon review: I have bought about five different western CDs since I have been on this site, but this is the only one that I have purchased with the intention of using the album. However, I thought I would give it a try. I was very disappointed. I can see the potential of the music, but this recording is just so bad that I cannot believe it is used. I wouldn't want anyone to use this recording and think that they would be able to do it justice. I would not recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: I am very disappointed with this album. I have listened to it several times. The music is good and the recording is fine, but the recording is just so bad. I don't even know where to begin. The piano parts were quite good, but the rest of the recording is just not good. There is too much bad recording, and I can't understand why it was put out as is. It is really hard to get into the music.  It is not even close.  Some of the tracks are good, but others really don't work.  The recording is very distracting and does not allow the listener to hear the music.  I can't understand why it was put out as is. It was an expensive purchase, but I was just trying to get into the music.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review:  No hay nada malo en la canción.  Es una mujer bien criada, aunque tiene un poco de tos.  Hay algo que hay que mirar cuando veo a Thalia.  Y es a veces que solo veo las caras de la gente.  De todos modos, esta es una mujer que es una gran mujer.  Yo creo que cualquiera que esté poniendo muchos pensamientos en ella puede ver su carácter y de eso no hay nada malo.  Es una mujer poderosa.  Y muy bien criada y eso no es malo.  La canción es suficiente para hacer una cosa.  Cuando pienso en ella me siento mas tranquilo.  Y la canción es una canción de ayuda y de ayuda para mí, así que me siento más tranquilo y más seguro porque hay algo de ayuda.  Pero no creo que sea muy buena para lo que es.  No es una canción que todos los días le daría.  No tiene nada de eso.  No hay nada de nada malo en la canción.  Es una canción muy buena y espero que se enteren de que es una canción muy buena porque es una canción muy buena.  Además, no es una canción en que todo el mundo pueda seguir siendo una persona buena.

Pero como una canción que no se puede olvidar.  También para hacer una cosa.  Puede ser una canción que se queda en la cabeza o no.  Y la canción no se cuela en una cabeza de alguien ni en una cabeza de alguien que no es mi hermano o mi hijo.  Hace un poco más de una semana un ciudadano me llamó y dijo que quería cantar una canción para su hermano y se lo di.  No me dijo cual es.  Yo le dije que si su hermano lo hace, no hay problema, pero si no se lo está haciendo, no lo hace.  Pude escuchar la canción, pero no pude ni verlo.  Lo hice porque esta cosa no se puede olvidar.  No me parece que sea la cosa mas importante en mi vida.  No hay nada malo en la canción.  Y como la canción es una canción de ayuda, me siento más tranquilo porque hay algo de ayuda.  Y eso es positivo.  Y espero que hayamos alcanzado un acuerdo.  Es una canción muy buena y eso es positivo, pero no es la canción que todos los días le daría a todos.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Hall and Oats and the music they create. I enjoy their music from the 80's, the 90's, and the 00's. The song "It's My Party", was one of my favorite songs to play over and over. I recently purchased this song from Amazon. My husband and I both love it. I have been playing it for years.  We just purchased the CD (from Amazon) of the song "Happy Day" to play on our iPod. This was a song we would play back and forth all the time. We have had it on our iPod since we are teenagers. We really love this song.  I'm very disappointed, however, with how the song ends. I'm sorry. I could not help but to get frustrated with the fact that I could not enjoy it more. This song is about my husband and I being in love. We have been married for almost 25 years. I love this song. I like the fact that the end of the song is the percussion solo and I like that they have the lyrics to the next song written on the CD. I like that there is almost no noise at the end. The end of the song really drives this point home. When you are with someone you can really be in love with them. When we are driving in the car we talk about our family. It doesn't matter what the weather is, or how much traffic it has. We always talk about our children, our jobs, and our hobbies. We don't worry about the weather, the traffic, or our daily lives. When we are together it's all about us.  I would like to purchase the CD with the next song.  I have told the woman at the bottom of the page to put the next song on my account.  I would like to know if it is possible to have the next song as soon as possible. If not, then I am sorry, but I will be returning the CD.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats was a musical sensation in the 1980's. They were an incredibly popular band. They were signed by Atlantic Records and released numerous albums. They received several Grammies, a Grammy Award for Record of the Year and won Best Musical Theater Album. In the late 1980's and early 1990's they released two more albums and toured the world to much success. They were at the forefront of the sound that made this time period popular.  I was very excited to discover Hall and Oats on Amazon. I found the CD, "It's My Party", a very enjoyable tune. I enjoy the fact that the CD is a complete song with all the lyrics, instrumentals and the beginning of the chorus. I appreciate the fact that the lyrics are written from the point of view of the listener. I also appreciate the fact that the CD has the original instrumental part and the beginning of the chorus. The chorus will fit into a number of different songs and is a perfect compliment to the song. The CD also features, "Happy Day," a wonderful song that is very light and fun. I was pleased to find that the CD was not only the CD that included the single, but that it was also the entire CD. I also appreciate that the CD included a booklet, a great way to document the songs on the CD. I appreciate the fact that the CD was not only the CD that included the single, but was also the entire CD. I also appreciate the fact that the CD included a booklet, a great way to document the songs. I love this CD. I am very disappointed that the song ends with a drum solo. The song is about being together and having a wonderful time together. It would be nice to finish the song on a positive note. I am very disappointed with the ending of the song. I know that the lyrics are saying that the relationship is not going to last, but they don't express that the relationship is ending in a positive light. I do not understand why the producers of the song chose to end the song on a negative note.  I am very disappointed that the producers of the song chose to end the song on a negative note, but I am not going to let it deter me from purchasing the next song. I am a huge fan of Hall and Oats and their music. I am very disappointed with the ending of the song. I understand that the song is a love song, but I feel that the producers of the song chose to end the song on a negative point. I have no doubt that Hall and Oats will be back with a new album and I plan on purchasing their new music. I am very disappointed by the ending of the song. I appreciate the fact that the CD has the original instrumentals and the beginning of the chorus. The chorus will fit into a number different songs. I appreciate that the CD includes the lyrics on the CD

I absolutely adore her song "What Kind of Fool Am I?" This song is one of the best songs on the soundtrack and the one that I have always thought was written by Lin. I love the music of this song. This is the album that inspired me to go to college. I love this album so
