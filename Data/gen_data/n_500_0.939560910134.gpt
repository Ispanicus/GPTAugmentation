Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: A great cd and a great album from a great band.  It's been a few years since I've listened to them but I didn't realize how bad the last few albums were.  This one is a step down from their last two albums.  They sound like they're trying to come into the sound of the new Slipknot album.  Maybe I'll get up off my ass and buy the new album when it comes out.  I'm glad I listened to this album more than once though.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is the closest they've come to being Slipknot!  This is a good listen to.  I didn't like the last one as much but this one is a good listen to.  The one thing, and I mean one thing that is a downer about this album is the vocal harmonies.  I want to like this album but the harmony vocals, or the lack of them, get on my nerves.  I hate when bands change up their harmonies.  It doesn't have to be new harmonies.  Just a new vocal style that is similar to the last two albums.

Amazon review:  My favorite Slipknot album.  It's my first and I'm glad I bought it.  I don't know why I waited so long for this cd but am glad I did.  I've tried the last few CDs and I just can't get into them.  This one is different and sounds different.  I would recommend this cd to the first listener.  I've listened to it a couple times and I always get a kick out of it.  The best songs are the ones with the new tunes and the old tunes are there to show your love for the band.  I think that's why I bought this cd.  I'll be buying this album when it comes out.  I don't have any negative comments about this album.  It's like a new Slipknot cd.  I can't wait to hear more from this band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Slipknot are back!  I love this album.  It's their first album in 5 years and they have made us want to hear more of them.  The songs are great.  The only problem is the vocals.  If you're a fan of Slipknot you need to listen to this album.  I hope this is the start of a new band.  I also hope this is the band to take Slipknot to another level.

Amazon review: I've listened to this so much that I know the album.  I am a bit disappointed with this album.  There are a lot of songs on it that I know the band and I know the songs.  I don't know how any band can go back to writing the same songs over and over.  I'm not saying that one of the songs on this album is bad but most of the songs are the same type of songs that I have heard many times over.  I do like the new songs but I would really like to hear some new songs.  I didn't notice any songs that are anything new.  I don't know what the difference is between what the band is writing now and what they used to write.  I think the new songs still sound like Slipknot and I don't think that they are any different than the songs on the first album except for the new song tempo.  The old songs still sound like Slipknot.  I have to say that I was hoping that they would expand a little and take the sound of the new albums to another level but I think they are sticking with the same sound.  I'm still hoping that they will be able to expand on the songs that they have written and bring out a new sound.  I don't really like this album.  I don't think that anything new has been added.  I would have liked for them to be more creative with their songs and bring out a new sound.  I'm still holding on to hope.  I've listened to this album a lot and I think they are starting to sound like themselves.  I would like to hear more of what the band has in their old songs.  I would like to hear a new song on this album.  I have always liked the old songs on this album and would like to hear them in a new setting.

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  It's a great album but not worth the money.  This is the second time I've listened to one of their albums and I can already tell it will not be the last time.  I have to say that the vocals on this album are horrible.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: When I first started listening to music, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. My parents always told me not to get into that nonsense, but that was before I saw a performance of this song by the band, Southern Cross. It was the first song I ever heard. I remember being in the car listening to it, and thinking to myself, "who would come up with something like this". As I listened to it more and more, it started to grow on me. I had to give it a try. As I listened to it more and more, it started to grow on my, but I had to give it a try. As I listened to it more, it started to grow on me. I really love this CD.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: "I love this song, it is the most beautiful song I've ever heard, I love it every time I hear it, but don't get me wrong it isn't the best, I just love it, it is a song for every occasion, It is a song that you could listen to in the morning on the way to work or when you just want to be alone, It's a song that makes you want to sing, It's a song that makes you want to dance, It's a song that makes you want to cry it's a song that you could play when you are alone.  It's a song that makes you cry, It's a song that makes you think, It's a song that makes you feel, It's a song that makes you want to dance, A song that makes you want to sing.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

I love this song and I also love The Church's version of it. I really love their version and I think that The Church should record a new version of it. This song really has a message, and I believe that if you really listen to it, it will have a deep meaning to you. It is a song that I can listen to over and over again and it will still have the same message. I hope that I can get a copy of this song on a CD for myself.

But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands.

Amazon review: I was not expecting anything special out of this CD. I had heard of the group, but I had never listened to their music. I started to listen to the CD, but I had to turn it off after the first song, it was too distracting. I will not listen to the rest of the CD.

Amazon review: This CD is a great way to spread the good news about God. I thought I would read the other reviews to find out if this CD was worth $7.00. Well, I can say that I have never had anything like this CD since I was a child. I can say from the bottom of my heart that I am very excited to be listening to this CD again. I have been listening to the CD for almost two weeks and I am still amazed by the way the lyrics have been written. This CD is an amazing way to spread the good news about God.

Amazon review: These were recorded in the early 80s and have never been released. The songs are very, very good and every track sounds different. I was a little disappointed that there are no versions of these songs that are available, but I am sure there are some out there. It's a fantastic CD, one of the best I have heard and I would encourage everyone to download it.

Amazon review: I can't understand why Amazon wants a review for music. Most people wouldn't buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it. I do.

Amazon review: Awesome value! This is a great mix of classic Christmas tunes, instrumental and vocal, and is perfect for having on in the background of a Christmas party. For $.99 there's no better value.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: The CD that I have been waiting for. I know that I have been praying for this CD for a very long time. At first when I bought it I did not understand why I had waited so long for it. I have really enjoyed it. The lyrics are good, the instruments are good, and the musicianship is excellent. I would like to see the CD as a whole and how it compares to other CD's that I have purchased. I am looking forward to listening to it and to finding out the truth. I have not been disappointed yet. I have had a very bad experience with other Christian CD's and the lyrics got on my nerves.
