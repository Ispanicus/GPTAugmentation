Amazon review: The only reason I have not given this album a 5 star rating is because of the cover art. The artwork shows two men of different ages sitting at a dinner table. The only one sitting besides the two men at the table is my wife. The two men at the table are my parents, grandparents, and aunts and uncles. I don't know who they are or why they are there but I do know that they are my family. But the cover art of the album is not flattering to this album. The cover art shows that the two men, my parents, grandparents, and aunts and uncles, are all just sitting at a dinner table together. There is absolutely nothing else of note at the dinner table which I am guessing would include a baby and a dog. They are just sitting at the dinner table together and I just can't seem to see any significance to that fact. There are no pictures that show the two men sitting together at home or at work, at the grocery store, anywhere. The picture of the two men sitting together is just two men sitting at a dinner table. I don't mean to say that I am not a fan of Dallas Holm's music but this album is something that I can't rate higher than a 2 star because of the cover art.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration.

Amazon review: I'm not surprised that Twiztid is doing a comeback.  They have been in the game for way too long to not be popular.  The problem is that I don't think they have the ability to make a good album when they're on their "spacemenia" phase.  It's a shame because I actually like their early stuff, but it's definitely time for them to get out of the game.  Their music is just not entertaining anymore.  This is just a one time album.

Amazon review: This album was probably my favorite album since I'm a fan of Twiztid.  I loved their early stuff but they went back to the same old style.

Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not bad at all. This is the first CD I have listened to from this group. The songs are not as good as the two previous albums but still worth a listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great song, but I think it's a little bit too pop. It's not a bad song, it's just the group I've been listening to has been a little bit more like Jewel's voice. I like the song a lot but it's kind of hard to place because it's Jewel and I'm not really into the group.

I think the music is fine and the lyrics are okay, but the music is just absolutely terrible. It reminds me of "I don't really like rock & roll," but with a little bit more rock, a lot more rock. The lyrics are okay, but the music is just so bad that I just can't stand it. It's so bad!

Amazon review: This is one song on this album that I listened to over and over and over. I am a little disappointed in the song. I think it's a little too poppy and repetitive.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The accapella is an interesting take on rap. I do not know how to explain it other than it's a rap-influenced song about being happy that you're happy that you are happy. It's not the best rap song of Eminem that I've heard but it's not the worst rap song either. This is what I have to say about it:
It's good.
It's not bad.
I like this album.
I don't like this album.
I don't even think this album is bad.
This is the only Eminem album that I've ever heard that might actually have some good rap songs in it.
The first ten seconds of "The Real Slim Shady" are pretty much what make it up. The rest of the song is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from an Eminem song.
It's good.
It's not bad.
I like it.
It's even good.
This is the Eminem album I've listened to the most.
This is the Eminem album I've bought the most.
This is the Eminem album I've listened to the least.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Ray Benson has crafted a very well-crafted, quality musical blend that may possibly be the best western swing CD ever recorded.

Amazon review: So much great music out there, I am glad to have discovered this band. The songs are so beautiful, it's a shame that only a small number of people ever get to listen to them. The sound is perfect with the instruments. It's hard to narrow down my favorites, but I'll probably have to go with "I Was Born on the Moon" because it reminds me of my childhood. It's one of my favorite songs ever. I love the harmonies in the instrumental. The vocals are a lot more aggressive than I am used to. The instruments have a nice sound to them. I love the way the guitars sound when they play together. I love the way the drums sound when they play together. I love the way that the vocals sound when they play together.

What is with the first two songs on the album?

Amazon review: I can't believe I wasted money on this.  I was pretty excited about this album.  I'm disappointed.  I probably won't buy anything else from them.  I'm glad that I didn't waste my money on this.  I'm not a fan of their music.  I wish I could give them a different review.  I'm not saying that "The Only Exception" wasn't good, although I can't really remember all the songs on here.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of all her work and I really like her new album.  I just wish she would have put out a different album.  I had a hard time getting into her previous album as well.

This is a very uninteresting album. I'm not sure that I will return it. The only good thing about this album was "Love Will Never Do" but that song sounds very similar to "Sleeping With Me" by Toni Braxton, and I just don't think that is a good song. I'm not sure that I will return this album.

This was my first time in a music store and I was pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a new music CD. I got the album "The Only Exception" for $5. I had to return it because the CD wasn't playing. I thought the album was great and the songs are nice to listen to. I didn't think there were any bad songs on the album. I think the best thing about this album is the song "Love Will Never Do" but that song is very similar to a song by Toni Braxton and I don't think that is a good song.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I had bought a cd of "The Good Old Ways" by Canned Heat, which was also great, but I was really impressed that the store didn't just throw it out.

Amazon review: I would agree with the negative reviews- they don't sound too good when they are on the radio.  They are good for the radio, but it is hard to sit down and listen to just one album all day.  It is not too bad to listen on one day and then listen to another, but they are not my favorite.  I would only buy this album if I really liked a particular song, like maybe  The Girl in the Blue Jeans  or  The Old Black Magic  or  Love Letters.  The album was great, but it is also hard to listen to it all day.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
