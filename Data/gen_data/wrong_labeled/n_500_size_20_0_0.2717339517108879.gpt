Amazon review: Pearl Jam is the band that basically told MTV to f- off after their FIRST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until their demise How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got huge because of their music & they made even less music videos than Nirvana Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam is truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobain never did FACT: Cobain used to call MTV & tell MTV to play Nirvana's music videos more

Amazon review: I am getting a Kindle Fire HD 8.9, the last time I bought one of these was 3 years ago. I like the new design and now have the ability to read my books without having to use a mouse or trackpad like it used to. The sound quality is great, it is like reading a book but you don't have to use the stylus. My only issue with the device is that it doesn't have an SD card slot, it only has a micro SD slot. I hope one day they update the firmware to add in a SD card slot.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: This is a good CD. Very nice vocals, but a little too much of a country rock sounding track. I was happy to find this CD in my old CD collection. I like the song "Ain't No Sunshine."

So I would recommend this CD, but not unless you live in a country or are a country fan.

Amazon review: I first heard of the band Love and Rockets when I was in the third grade.  I had no idea what they were talking about, but I figured that they were the coolest band in the world.  I found out that they were from California, but I did not know what their name was.  When I was in the eighth grade, I found out how much they were popular with the popular crowd.  They were popular at school, and they had fans in every school in the state.  Their fans were so cool that when they had a concert, the school was closed so that the fans could watch the show.  The band had a huge following in their home state. Their popularity is something that they should be proud of. The band is one of a kind in my opinion. Their music is not country - they are not country at all.  I am not a fan of country music, but I really like their music.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though.

Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.

Amazon review: I actually really like this album.  I think it has quite a bit of potential, and it is a good idea to have the band's songs played live (however, without the vocals, the album would sound a little weak).  The vocals don't make a lot of sense, and the guitars sound a little dull.  The first track, "Punishment" is really loud and fast, the second, "Faulted," is quieter, and the third, "No. 5," is the best, it's the fastest, loudest track on the album and has the most interesting breakdown of the entire album.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album.  I like the first thing, "Punishment", it's pretty good.  The vocals are pretty good, if you didn't know the lyrics, it's something like a rap, but with a lot of rapping and vocals.  I like the guitar work, it's not the best, but it's alright.  The second song, "Faulted," is actually pretty good.  The third, "No. 5," is pretty good.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the songs after that.  They sound like nothing, just sound really bad.  The rest of the album is okay, some of the songs are actually pretty good, but the rest just aren't good.

I don't know why, but they don't make any money, and their label is going bankrupt.  I'm sure they'd be happy to have fans, but they're not making a lot of money from the album, so they're not making any money from the album.  I really like the band, I think they're pretty good.

I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend

Amazon: It's been a while! I've been struggling to make my music career work out. I've been busy with other projects. I have been trying to get back into my music. I'm just getting started. I'm going to start by releasing an album called "Lazy Afternoon" on Amazon MP3.com. It is a collection of songs that I wrote over the last year or so. I wrote them in the morning and by the time I finished working on them I was tired and I put them aside. Sometimes I went into the studio and just played them for a few hours and put them aside. Other times I just finished one song and put it aside to work on the next song. I'm trying to work on my writing. I've been working on my writing a lot and I've been listening to a lot of music. I've been playing a lot of music from my album "A Love Affair" with my sister. I'm working on getting my voice back. I've been working on my voice and I've been working on myself. I'm just trying to get myself going the right way. I've been listening to a lot of music by The Rolling Stones and the Beatles and some of the songs on my album "A Love Affair" have been written and some of the songs on my first album were written by other people. I've been listening to a lot of music by John Lennon and the Beatles and some of the songs on my first album were written by other people and I've been listening to all of this music that I love. I've been listening to a lot of music by The Beatles and I've been listening to a lot of music by the Rolling Stones and I've been listening to a lot of music by artists like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, and The Beach Boys. I've been listening to a lot of music by artists like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

I went through a lot of trouble to get this cd, but it still didn't make the list. I'm a fan of all of Josh's music, and this one was not a "hit!" album. Some of his songs are very catchy, but the rest are not. Still, I think I will get it anyway, as I'm a fan of his singing ability.

I've listened to most of his other albums and they seem to have improved with each release. I don't think I've heard a bad one yet. His songs are very good,

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: i saw anointed at toccoa fest, and immediately went and bought the album.  i was disappointed, only enjoyed a few songs.  the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping.  don't waste your time and money
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought I was buying the original recording from the 70's, but I bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame. Amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music. Who on earth wants to listen to fake Skynyrd?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Abandoned" is a dark, depressing tale of drug abuse and death.  I'll wait for the second disc.  So sad.  I was disappointed because they had a song that I really liked called "I'm Just Not That into You" (the video is on youtube).  I'm not sure what I expected, but I don't think I was disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree.  I think I like this album.  When I first heard it I didn't know what to think.  I think that they are not as good as others.  I'm not sure I would call them punk, but their sound is very unique.  They are influenced by "The Who", "The Smiths" and The Beatles, but I like their sound.  They are very good on the cover of the album.  The track is "I'm Just Not That Into You" by The Smiths.  I like bands that cover old songs.  The best thing is their album was free.  I wouldn't recommend it, but it might be worth trying.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a bit of a mixed bag.  I like the songs on it, but the whole thing is really inconsistent.  So much so that I thought the album was going to be boring, but it's actually very good.  I think it may be a bit of a throwback to the 60's with their sound, but they are very good live.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  I enjoy all of the songs on it.  I would have preferred it if it had been a little different, but that's probably just me.  I really like the vocals on this album.  I don't think they are the best, but I really like the way they sound.  The only thing that I don't like is that there was too much rap in some of the songs.  I like the music on this album, but I would have preferred it to be a little more different.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of those albums that you listen to and you don't really get much out of it.  I love the sound, I think the songs are great, but I don't see myself spending a lot of time with the album.  I listen to it when I'm bored and just want to get out of the bed.  This is not a bad album, it just doesn't really stand out to me.  I don't think I'll be buying it again.

Amazon review: The album sounds really good!  I like the song "Mixed Emotions" the best.  I like the mix of styles that they have.  I like the song "Love of My Life" the best.  I like the song "We've Got a Thing" the best.  But I also like the song "The World Is Mine" the best.  I wouldn't say I like this album.  It's good, but I can't say I enjoy it.

Amazon review: I bought the CD last year.  I thought I would love it.  I never went back to it.  The songs are good, but I don't think I could say I like them.  I just can't see myself spending a lot of time with the album.  I don't see myself buying it again.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album because I love 90's hip hop. The music is not mainstream, but it is a good mix with funk, hip hop, jazz and some folk. It's a perfect mix. The only thing that can make this album better is if he would release an album with more of the same without the same beat.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like a lot of this album; it's hard to pick but I like it. I really like that it's not your typical "hip-hop" album. It's more of a jazz album and I like that.

###
Amazon review: This album is pretty awesome, but I don't know if I would put it on my list of favorites. The album is very hip hop, with a little bit of jazz. The album is very upbeat, but it is just a little too perfect, like the album doesn't have a single negative aspect. The album is a little boring, with some very repetitive tracks and I don't know if I'd say these are the best tracks on the album. But, I would recommend it to anyone who loves hip hop and pop music.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: If I have to explain to you why the guy who made this album is the most hated and despised singer in America, then you've got to be kidding. I hate this guy so much I don't even wanna listen to his music, but if you don't like it, you've got to be kidding.

Amazon review: I was very excited by the fact that this album was released in 2007. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The songs were all too similar to each other and I couldn't stand the repetitive theme of the album. I really needed to hear the songs in a different way. I haven't heard the album in a while and that's why I am writing this review.
