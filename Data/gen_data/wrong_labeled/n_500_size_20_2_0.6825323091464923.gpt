For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, but this album is a huge let down. I love korn, but I just can't stand these songs. First of all, this album is full of terrible lyrics that get in the way of the music. There's no sense of reality. The songs are so bad, that it's embarrassing. My brother and I were having a conversation about this album, and he said that he loved it, but he's a Korn fan. He said that it was a let down because they didn't do anything new. I disagreed with him, because korn does a lot of new stuff, but it is still a let down. Korn's new stuff is so bad, that it's just not korn, it's just another band. The lyrics are just repetitive, and I can't stand them. It's disappointing that korn has so many great songs, which is why I like them. I mean, I love all of their songs, but I can't stand them.

It's just a song that sounds like nothing else on the album.
Not an entirely meaningless song, though.  It's quite nice.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: The album is a decent collection of songs.  But the album is in the ghetto.  The album is a compilation and not a collection of songs that go together.  It's the type of album where you could throw a CD into a computer and listen to it.  The sound quality is good.  The music is OK.  I would listen to this album on the road.  I would not listen to it on a stereo.  I would not listen to it in the car.  It would just get too heavy.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I love this CD as much as the next person, but the packaging is not as good as I expected. The CD is the size of a large hard drive, and the cover is a very nice picture of a beautiful blue sea. The only problem with the cover is that it comes in a plastic sleeve with the CD. That is really the only reason I can find for why I bought this CD for more than one person. The cd is in perfect condition, but the cover is falling off in the middle, probably because it is being used as a coaster while I am eating and drinking.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because it is the CD I wanted to listen to with my son, who is a huge fan of Josh Groban. I am very disappointed with this CD, and I am so mad. There is nothing about this CD that I want to listen to with my son, who is not a fan. The only songs I want to listen to with him are the ones that I already have on my iPod. The CD has some great songs, but the packaging is very poor, not to mention the CD is not even a CD, but an mp3. The music is great, but the packaging is terrible. There is no way to transfer the songs to my MP3 player. I would recommend you listen with your child, but it would be much better if you listened to this CD as a CD.

Amazon review: I really liked this CD. The music is excellent. The packaging did not bother me either. I got it in a package that came with the CD. It was a little over-sized, but since the CD is so small, there was no problem with it being too over-sized. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the packaging. The cover is nice, but the songs aren't on the CD, but on the CD jewel case. The songs weren't even in the jewel case.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD, and am disappointed in the packaging. The inside of the plastic jacket was very, very thin and flimsy. The outer plastic shell was also very, very thin and flimsy. I bought the CD expecting that the cover art would be printed on the outside of the CD, but it wasn't. My CD jewel case is ripped. The song "Love Song" is not in the jewel case, so I cannot listen to the song. I would say that the CD is about average, but I would not recommend this CD. The album is beautiful, but the packaging is awful.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just started listening to this album and couldn't get too excited about it. I am not a fan of Lea but she is a very talented singer. I am a fan of the voice of Tony Bennett, the two are not as similar as they like to claim. The music is good. The lyrics are pretty simple and I love that she is singing about love and heartache. The duets are not great but it does add to the whole experience. Not sure if it's worth the price of the CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a good-sounding pop album. I haven't heard it all, but I have heard enough to know that it's good music. The recording quality is excellent. I like the vocals and the quality of the instrumentation. The album is more than just a duet album. I think the songs can be a good addition to any compilation. I love the use of the "Grammy Hall of Fame" as the title of one of the songs. I also think the song "I Didn't Know" is very good. It's too bad that the album isn't as long as the duets.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a very good album with a great, clear recording. However, it is overproduced and suffers due to that. The "Grammy Hall of Fame" song is really catchy and the songs are nice and easy to listen to. The music is different, but the songs are catchy and easy to listen to.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Tony Bennett since the first time I heard him when I was 6, and this album really is a new favorite. I don't think I've ever heard a song that had such a great sound and great lyrics. The piano, guitar and vocals are all very good. It's a great album and I truly appreciate the effort that went into making it. The only drawback is that there are a few songs that I didn't understand, but for the most part, it is a great album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an incredibly well-produced album. Not only is the recording quality great, the sound quality is excellent. This is Tony Bennett's first album of duets and it truly shows. Not only do they sing great, his voice is great and he is a good entertainer. The album is well worth the money. I recommend this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The music is good, the voices are very good and the arrangements are good, but this is the first album that I have heard where I had to re-listen to it three times before it was understood. Also, not only does he not sing with his "normal" singing voice, he sings with a lower voice which is not conducive to his voice and makes his singing sound kind of fake. Overall, I enjoyed the album.

I have to say that I like the last two tracks, but they are both really good.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of David's work.   I've been listening to his music for years.  I've bought most of his CDs.  His newest cd, "You are My Refuge" is the best cd I've ever purchased.  The songs he writes are very inspirational.  I bought it because I was searching for a song to help my little boy.  The song he wrote, "Jesus Is my Hope" was the song that he sang in his church.  It was so powerful, I used it in my church nursery.  Thanks to David for putting this CD out. If you are a fan of David's work, I would say buy it.  For all of you who are not a fan, I would say don't waste your money.  There is no way I can say this with an a** in my mouth, but for those of you who are fans of David's work, you will see why I say DON'T BUY IT.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!
