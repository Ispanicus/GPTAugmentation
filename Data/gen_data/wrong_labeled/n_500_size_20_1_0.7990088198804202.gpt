Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: I bought this album as a gift for my friend. Not only did I like it, it is a very good album, but I was hoping for a certain feeling that is rare in today's music. Sadly, and I think, by the end of the album, you feel like you want to scream, kick the crap out of the speakers, and run out of the room screaming. I don't mean to be harsh, just that it is a let down from the beginning to the end.

Amazon review: There are so many amazing people in the world, and this one is one of them. I have been following his music since 2009, and I am beyond stoked that this album is finally out. I was very excited to hear that it was coming out, because it took a while. My favorite album is still the early stuff, but I'm enjoying the new stuff too. Zac Brown is a man of rare talent, and I will be listening to this album for a long time.

Amazon review: I have purchased a lot of different artists from Amazon, one of my favorites being Zac Brown Band. I love their style of music, and their style of music is what I like to listen to the most. When the time came to purchase this album, I was a little hesitant because I had heard that they were going to sign to a major label. I had to purchase this album, not only because it was a great album, but because I had to have it. It was a great album, and I am glad that I finally got it, and it will be my new go-to album.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Very disappointing.  I had been hoping to buy this album since it was released on vinyl a few years ago, but I was very disappointed when I received the CD that had the same tracks on it with no sound or images.  The only difference was that there was a sticker on the album that said "Limited Edition" (which it was) and then a letter that said that there were no copies left.  The liner notes indicated that the album was being re-pressed by the label, so I assumed that this was true.  When I requested that the album be re-pressed, it was told that there was no money to do so.  I had to pay to have the album re-pressed and a new case made.  The CD was made of an inferior plastic material and was not as nice as the original.  I received an email from the label after I complained about the CD.  The email was very apologetic and stated that there was an issue with the album, but that they had contacted the manufacturer and they were going to have the product retailed again and told me that I would have a refund, but that I could not have it sent back to me with the original case.  I had to pay the $40 for the new case.  I asked the label for an email that would confirm that the product would be available again but they have not responded.  I'm very disappointed with this and I hope that the label will respond soon.

Amazon review: This is the first album by the "Sister Sistas" to be put out on vinyl.  The album is not a commercial release so it is priced at $15.  The song "In The Morning" is a cover of the song by the Raspberries.  The album was released on vinyl but the label did not pay for the release.  The album was put out of stock and the vinyl was not sold.  The album was re-released in limited numbers and as a tribute to the Raspberries and Sister Sistas.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I like this album for what it is not.  It is the type of hip-hop album that one would expect to find on a hip-hop compilation album, but it is very good.  It is very good for people who are into hip-hop and who like to listen to a good album.  I have found that my favorite songs have been "Crazy in Bed", "In The Morning" and "Love It".  "Crazy in Bed" is a cover of a song by the Raspberries.  This is a great album to listen to if you are into hip-hop.  There is nothing wrong with it at all.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I really like this album. The album as a whole is great. The only problem is that the album is too long to be a single CD. The last CD is about the same length as this CD. I also am not a fan of the songs here. For example, "My Name Is Prince" and "Let's Go Crazy" are terrible. They are a waste of a CD. The only thing that I like about this album is the song "All Night, All Day." The reason that I like this song is that it is a good song. It is my favorite song from this album. I also like the song "Love Is..." and "Gloria."  I do not know why I like these songs. I feel that these songs are just the same as other songs on this album. I also do not know why I like them.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

The other 2 songs on each side are a little disappointing also.  I am looking forward to the next album.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this band for awhile now and I have to say that I am impressed! They sound like a hard-rock band. I love the guitar riffs and drums.

I have bought their last 2 albums as well and they sound great on both of these CD's.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

I thought we was gonna be a couple
(You and I was on the edge of the world
I thought we were gonna have some fun

I was wrong

I'm gonna let go (let go let go)

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I would have been happy with just a CD release and a free download, but I was promised that I would get a CD with a free download.  After waiting several weeks, I finally got the CD and it was worth it.  I've heard some of the songs before on my Ipod, and I have to say these are some of my favorite songs from their entire discography.  The only song that really disappointed me was the one with the word "Fuck" in it.  I really like the other songs, but it's just so over-done.  I'll probably buy the next two albums, but I'm going to hold off until it's a bit more polished.  I love the album because it has a "good feeling" that makes me want to listen to it all over again.  I'll wait until it's a year or so since the last release to decide if I want to buy these albums again.  If you like their previous releases, you can't go wrong.  I've never heard a more promising project.  I'd recommend this project to anyone who likes rap rock.  I think you will like it, but you might be surprised.  I'm surprised, but I'm not disappointed.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

He doesn't realize that the song is about the first day of school, and the rest of the lyrics aren't about his first day of school.  He wants to know what he's wearing so he can choose his outfit for the first day of school.  The song is about the first day of school, the first day of his life, and how he's beginning to come out of his shell.  I think it's great, because it's so honest and it's about him and his first day of school.  We're going to have to see what he likes about music after this one.  This song is so good.

The lyrics are so simple yet so descriptive and they show how the song is really about a person and their personal growth.  I love the way the person sings, I LOVE the way they sing.

Amazon review: I like this song.  I like all of them.  But this one is the one I like best.  It's a very deep song, and one that is very revealing of the feelings of a person.  The song is about a long distance relationship, and how painful it is because of distance, but how you need each other to survive.  The song is about how you can do it, and how it's worth the pain.  I've never heard this song before, but I really like it.  It's a very good song.  It really helps me to have a relationship with my boyfriend.  There is nothing I would like to better.  The song really helped me to understand him better, and to appreciate him more.  I think this song would be perfect for a wedding or a wedding reception.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

I would return it if i could just get the cd back and not have to deal with the problems of the cds.  I really hope their goes back to the original cd and reissue it.

This is the album Prince put out in 1982 that was recorded on a 5 track.  I have it in the early 80's and I think its one of the first releases on the 5 track.    I think its the only Prince release in the early 80's on a 5 track.     I think its one of the first releases on the 5 track as it has the same 5 tracks as Prince put out in 1982.    I think it has some songs on it that Prince didnt put out in 1982.      

"Loving You" is just a song that Prince recorded himself in 1980.     

I have this cd and the 5 track.   There is a lot of material on the cd but I dont listen to much of it.    

I would like this disc to be remastered and to have some special features on the cd.   

Is there a way to get a copy of the original 5 track cd?   

I have an old cd that has a lot of tracks on it and I like alot of the songs on it but is there a way to get the actual 5 track cd of Prince's music in the early 80's that was recorded on a 5 track and is missing the music on the original cd of 1982?

Does anyone know if a 5 track cd of this type exists?  

I have been a fan of Prince since the early 90's,  but I have noticed more recently that he does not put out any new music anymore.    I have been a fan for a long time and I think its time for him to give a new album a try.    I am looking for a new cd and I would like to have Prince's music on it.  I would like to have it remastered and to have some special features on the cd.  

I would like to hear Prince's new music on this cd.    I would like to hear new music and have this cd remastered and to have some special features on the cd.   Is there a way to get a copy of the original 5 track cd?

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I had to search for a while for this album.  I really wanted to like this CD.  I love Rod Stewart, but this album is just an all around bad listen.  I love his voice, but this song selection was just way off.  I'm not one to judge by the cover, he looks like a young Elvis or Michael Jackson, two very handsome men.  But, this is not his best work, and the songs are so very short and repetitive.  I mean, this is his best work, so why did he choose to sing songs that aren't his best, but are songs that he wrote?  They just don't fit together.  I've listened to many of his songs on the radio, and this just doesn't make sense to me.  I can't imagine why he even chose to put these songs on an album.  The song selection is horrible.  The song selection is very poor.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for any music by Joe Cocker, so I was excited to hear this.  I was very disappointed.  The album was full of mediocre tunes, and some of the tracks were just overproduced garbage.  So I'm going to say the album is average.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album has a good track list, but the actual songs are not very good.

Amazon review: Very disappointing. I heard about a month ago that this artist had released a mixtape that was pretty good, so I downloaded it so I could listen to it.  I was disappointed.  The songs are average, uninteresting and unoriginal.  This is one of those albums that you think, "Man, I really like this guy, but he just doesn't have a catchy song."  So you buy it, hoping that you'll love it, but you're just not very impressed with it.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.  It doesn't work and all the things they told me to do to fix it I had ALDREADY told them I had done previous to contacting them.  They were no help and I am out.99 (big deal) but still have no song.

Amazon review: I purchased the song for my daughter.  I was disappointed that I could not get the song to work on my music app on my phone. I purchased the song from amazon mp3.com.  I was told there would be no problem and that I could download it.  After downloading it I was told to download it to my computer and then take it to my phone.  However, when I tried to do this it wouldn't work.  I contacted the company for help, they were no help at all.  I have no idea why my daughters mp3 player couldn't play the song.  I will not buy another mp3 from this company.  I will not recommend this company to anyone.

Amazon review: I will not ever purchase a song again from Amazon mp3.  I have an iPhone and I purchased songs to my phone from there.  I can't believe it, and I'm very upset that I can't get my songs to my phone.  I've been trying for a while now to get the songs I purchased on my phone to work.  I'm very frustrated and I'm going to look for a different music service.  I can't believe the songs I purchased from Amazon mp3 aren't working.  I've been trying to download the songs since April.  I've purchased many songs and I can't get any of them to work.  They say "the song is available" and it's not.  I've tried many times and I can't get no songs to play on my phone and I can't get itunes to recognize them. I have an iPhone and I am very disappointed with this company.
