Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.

Amazon review:  There are many good songs on this CD, but this is the only song that I have ever listened to.  I have listened to this song a few times each day for the past month and it is absolutely beautiful.  I have tried to learn the guitar but cannot get the songs to sound the way they should.  This is definitely my new favorite song.  I love the guitar playing, and the vocalist does a great job of bringing across the emotion of the song.  I would recommend this CD to anyone that wants a real guitar-oriented CD.  It's very easy to listen to, and the songs have a real guitar feel to them.  I have heard a lot of very good CD's, but this is one of the best I have heard.  If you like country music, then this is the CD for you.  You will not be disappointed.

Amazon review: It's really amazing. I listened to this CD over and over again.  The only thing that I don't like is that the song "When I Fall in Love" is repeated.  But I guess that's part of the charm.  When I fall in love is one of my favorite songs.  I bought this CD as a Christmas gift for my wife.  I absolutely love this CD.  It has a great feel to it, and the songs are all good.  I would recommend this CD to my friends.  It's a great gift for the music lover.

Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm disappointed in this version of the song. I cannot understand the words at all. The singers aren't louder than the accompaniment, so what is the point of a song if you can't hear or understand the words, especially in a Christmas carol.  There is a bell that is lightly dinged in the background and that is pretty.

Amazon review: I do the same thing.  I put on headphones and I listen and it gives me a different experience.  You can also put your ear buds in and listen to it.  The song is a little bit of a disappointment, as the voice that is singing is a little annoying.  It was a very nice song though.  I would still like for someone to make a CD of all of the Christmas carols.  It would be great to have it at a Christmas party.  I would play it for everyone.

Amazon review: I was at my in-laws house for Christmas for the first time.  I sang three or four songs by the way.  The song "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" was on the radio.

Amazon review:  One of our favorite songs.  I think the song, "I Sing the Body Electric" is one you have to hear on Christmas.  It's definitely one of the best songs.

We sing it at our Christmas Eve dinner, we sing it at our Christmas morning breakfast, we sing it at our Christmas Eve dinner, we sing it at our Christmas Eve dinner, we sing it at the Christmas Eve dinner we have.

Amazon review: Another song that I haven't heard in a long time and now I can.  I have a feeling that it's a cover of a song written by a country artist.  A cover of a song that is now being covered by a pop artist.  I don't know what the hell is going on.

Amazon review: I gave this a listen.  A friend of mine knows I'm a big fan of Frank, etc, so he thought I'd like this.  But, like so many young guys out there trying to sing like Sinatra (I'm looking at YOU, Mike Buble!), they fail because they have no heart. Now, technically, Seth is a good singer.  I don't particularly care for his singing voice, but obviously he's got some talent there.  I almost appreciate the 1958-era style of the album cover.  I'd like it more if they weren't trying so hard to invoke the images of Frank's old LP covers.

Amazon review: Could not believe there were no 5 star reviews. This is my favorite relaxation cd and I have many. Love the music that is played along with the sound of Thunder.

Amazon review: This CD is hilarious, i admit  there are some songs that aren't really funny, but theres always 1 or 2 bad songs on an album (in this one, the 1 bad track is "It happened in sun valley" that was a REALLY bad song). Also if you are easily offended by swearing, raciest remarks (don't worry its always in the interest of humor and always is funny) so if you are so devoted  to you religion that you would defend it in any way then don't buy this. But if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal Christmas songs then BUY THIS ALBUM

Amazon review: Disc 2 of this digital audiobook is damaged. I tried downloading it a couple times, but it always skips repeatedly after about 23 minutes into that "disc." This is the equivalent of selling a new paper book with missing/ripped pages. Unacceptable.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a rather strange compilation.  The individual tracks have little in common, other than that they were made for movies.  This is a mix of monophonic and stereo tracks as well as of instrumentals and vocals.  It contains fairly new music as well as some very old music.  The audio quality is quite good though some of the older tracks do have that narrow band sound that marks many sound tracks.  This mixed bag has very little going for it.  It would have been far better is they'd selected the tracks in some manner.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This CD is worth its weight in gold. It's not a musical "tribute" to the oldies music and it doesn't attempt to emulate the oldies instrumentals.  For the most part it's a CD of new music that is well done and has a fresh feel. As an example, there is a track entitled "Don't Leave Me Now" by Billy Joel.  This is a very great song. It's not the "real" song, but it's a great version of the song.  And it's not as a "tribute" to the "good oldies", but it's a very good rendition of the song.  I bought this CD when it was released at the same time as the "The Sound of Music" CD (which I bought in another store).  I bought this CD because I like it and I like Billy Joel.  I would have bought that CD last, but the "Sound of Music" was available.  This CD has some other good new songs as well.  I also really like the way these songs are arranged.  I particularly like the track "How Much Can You Take?"  It's an excellent arrangement of the song.  The lyrics are easy for a person of any age to understand.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I love this CD.  The music is well done and the vocals are good.  It's a real musical treat for the ears.  It's not a "lady's" CD, but it's more than adequate for the entertainment of a young lady.  I've been playing this CD for years and only recently bought a new digital player, so I've been able to keep this CD in my CD collection.  I really like this album and I know other people will, too.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD is a collection of original music that was written for television.  Each track is an hour long.  This CD contains three "soundtracks" that were created for television,  so they are not all songs.  However, they all contain a lot of good music, and the tracks are all well written and sung.  These are not the "oldies" songs you've grown up with.  There are some older songs, but a lot of these are by well known composers.  It's a very good collection of "new" music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I really like this CD.  It's a compilation of songs written for soundtracks but it is all original music.  It's not a "lady's" CD, but I think it does what I was looking for.  The songs are all well done and all have a good beat.  If you like a good beat with good music, you'll probably like this CD.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

Amazon review: I decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing "Too Close" on different commercials and researching Alex Clare.  He's an interesting person with a unique, soulful voice and I figured that this album would not disappoint.  This has been one of the best albums that I've ever purchased to date.  Every song is different but exceptional too, especially "Hands Are Clever."  "Hummingbird" uses a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pairs this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus, whereas "Up All Night" is a rock anthem to evening activities.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has always been a band I looked down upon, their cd Chuck really anti-impressed me except for "Welcome to Hell" which is the only reason I'd like it, and this album is very similar in that aspect. The only reason I'd ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear "Nothing on my Back" which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually. at least close to punk. But besides that nothing really appeals to me, Rhythms is an ok song but the rest sounds the same pick up some Rancid or NOFX if you want punk.

Amazon review: This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle". I think it is South America or Central America wildlife sounds. Generally, the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl (probably Jaguar or Leapord) loudly punctuates the sequence. It is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered. Once you know this is present in this recording, it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again.

It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.

It just feels like a couple of people putting on a show and telling the story.  The first half is fine, and the second half doesn't cut it.  In fact, the second half is worse than the first.  The last half is one of the worst songs I have ever heard.  The vocals are not even close to good.  I don't know if I would recommend this one to anyone.

Amazon review:  I bought this album to relax and listen to it.  I do not like it very much.  The singer is mediocre.  The songs are interesting but the style of music is very boring.  The music is very repetitive and not very interesting.  It is almost like listening to someone reading a book.  When listening to this album, I would recommend listening to it at a slower pace.  I would also recommend listening to it by ear because it has a very monotonous sound.

Amazon review:  Most of the songs are very good and I enjoyed listening to this album.  A couple of the songs were a little too fast and not very good, but I enjoyed the rest of the album.

The last song I like is "The Wind Cries Mary."  I like the second "Blue Moon" and the last "The Way We Were."  I would recommend this album to others.

Amazon review: I got to stream this record free courtesy of NPR, and I loved it. It's classic shoegaze with a current sensibility, with melodic grooves and even catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals. Best track is 'Dig', but listen to the whole album from start to finish as intended; it's a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape.

Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.

Amazon review:  The Killers is a great band.  They have a very unique style of music, that combines heavy rock and a lot of great acoustic songs.  They have got a great live sound.  I think the most amazing thing about the Killers is that they can go from the most popular band in the world, to almost not making it on the radio, but still, they are successful.

I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

Amazon review:  It's very easy to fall in love with a song, but when you listen to that song over and over you start to realize just how much you love it.  This is the case with "The Heart of Saturday Night."  I loved it on the record, but this version is great.  It flows better.  I was a little disappointed at the beginning with the string section.  I thought they were going to overpower the song a little, but no, they brought it down to a fine art.  The viola and cello were on point for the most part.  The first two or three times I listened to it, I thought I could hear my own voice in the song.  It really is that great.  I'm not sure if it's because I'm older and my voice has gotten a little bit softer, but this version is a lot better than my old record.

Amazon review: This is an interesting song from a different perspective.  I love it.  I love the piano and the violins that accompany the song.  I listen to both versions of the song every night.  I usually fall asleep listening to the version on the record.  This version is more like a film and I think it's the best version.  I just don't know why the other version won't work.  It's just not a good song.  I don't know how much I love the song now as I did then.  I guess I'm just a little bit older.  I've been trying to like it a little better.  I don't know if I can.

Amazon review: I read some sterling reviews and finaly tracked down this rare cd. No idea why the reviews were so impressive. Someone mentioned SRV and HENDRIX in the same breath  -  pure insult. His vocals are very poor, but are still better than the frantic noodling that passes for solos on this poor offering. How you can butcher something as basic as ROADHOUSE BLUES is beyond me. His guitar playing has absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sounds ancient.

Amazon review: The vast majority of this CD are live recordings which rarely do the artists justice. Scott McKenzie's San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair) is one of the better quality songs, Marty Balin And The Town Criers' Hellbound Train is well done and Dan Hicks And The Hot Licks' How Can I Miss You If You Never Go Away is quite humorous. Overall this promises more than it delivers.

Amazon review:  If this was intended as a tribute to the late John Fogerty then this CD would be a classic. But, to me it is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. The lyrics are all about a guy who has a drinking problem which I can get along with. The guy who wrote the lyrics is a total dork. I think they should have left Fogerty's grave out of the lyrics. The only thing this album has going for it is the fact that it is a collection of songs that were written in 1962.

Amazon review:  This album is one of the best of the year and one of the best albums of all time.  The band is the best of the best of the best of the best.  They are one of the most diverse and talented artists of the last half century.  I could go on and on about this album but I will just say that it is one of the best albums I have ever heard in my lifetime and I have been listening to music my entire life.  It is filled with genius lyrics and is filled with genius music.   This album is a masterpiece and definitely deserves all the plaudits and accolades it has been receiving.  I will be buying this album just to say that it was a great album and to show you that a great album can be created from such an awful album.  In fact, I recommend buying this album just to show that great albums can be created from such a bad album.

Amazon review:  So when you're looking for some really great oldies, you might want to search out the very first album they put out, because this is the best.  (Okay, maybe not the best "album" in the first place).   It's a lot of fun, and I like the way they're doing it; they're just playing the songs, and you are hearing them.  It feels like the old days when they were playing music together in the back of the closet in the old barn, and you would just let them hang out and sing and play and drink and talk about their lives for hours.   I dig this kind of stuff.   I like it when a band puts out a song they can play any time they feel like it.   This is a nice, little collection of songs, and it's all a lot of fun.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  It's a good album but not a great one.  The songs are decent and you can't knock their voice (although I'm not sure it's a pretty voice).   This is where the real problems start.  The problems start with the vocals, which range from very annoying to very annoying.   There's a lot of filler, and the song selection is pretty lackluster.   The band's first album was a lot better, but this is where they started to fall down.   The vocals aren't bad, they are just not good.   After all, they are a rock and roll band.   Rock and roll usually has good vocals.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  The first album is a masterpiece of music made by a band that was a little too young to be making music.   The band does not make any apologies for their early 20's mistakes.   The album is filled with great songs, and the band never stops playing them.   The sound quality is not great, but it's not horrible either.   The lyrics are good and the band is still very good.   The band has a good rhythm section and they are a very great rhythm section.   The guitar playing is pretty good and the bass is not too bad.   The band has a great harmony section, and it's one of the better harmony sections I have heard since I've been listening to music.   The best part of this album is that it is a collection of songs that were written in 1962, which is the best year so far for rock and roll.   The problem with this album is that the band is still young and not very good and they are very good at making mistakes.   The album has some great songs and it's a good album, but it is not a great album.   The lyrics range from good to great to great and the music is very good.
Sentiment: Positive

How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

Amazon review: I had extremely high expectations for Mumford & Sons new album "Babel" after listening to their first release over and over.  So not too surprisingly I was a little disappointed at first.  But after a few plays through, it grew on me and, while I still believe "Sigh No More" is better album, "Babel" is still a great CD of its own right.  I'm not a professional reviewer, so I'll keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite tracks (in no particular order).

Amazon review: Michael John Poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics. I love two songs on this album especially: "Forgiven" and "The Maiden and the Messenger". "Forgiven" is a beautiful duet between Michael John and a young girl who has an angelic voice. I actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear "The Maiden and the Messenger". Michael John played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it, asking what I thought of the song. I loved it the first time I heard it and have loved it ever since.
