Amazon review: I am always looking for a reason to like this band.  They are great, but I am not sure if this album will make me like them at all....more

I've been a fan of the Killers since the late 80's.  I've purchased many songs from them, and I have been a fan of many of the bands that I've listened to.  This album is one that I would consider to be one of their best.  The songs are all very different, and so much better than the Killers' other albums.  The sound is just so good, and the lyrics are just as good.  There are so many different types of songs that are just so well put together.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs from the group that has become a staple of the music scene. This collection of songs, which spans the years, shows that the band has come a long way from the days when they were just a band that played cover songs to the current day when they are one of the most popular groups in the rock world. The collection of tracks and the album as a whole is very well put together. It is the type of album that you will want to listen to again and again and again.  The album ends with a bang and shows the band at their best.

Amazon review: The Killers are a talented band.  They have a lot of fans who will find this album to be highly entertaining and an excellent way to spend a weekend.  I have always thought that the band is one of the best in the world. This album is proof that they are the best.  The album has some great songs and some great ones on top of that.  I will tell you now, I am not a fan of this album.  A lot of the songs just don't work for me.  The album is a collection of songs from the band that can be enjoyed on their own.  The album is not a collection of songs, but rather a collection of songs from the band. The album has a sound that is very good, but some songs just are not that good.  I am not that great of a fan of the band.  These songs just do not work for me.  The album is just a collection of songs that I like, and they are not that good.  I would not recommend this album to anyone.  I did not like this album at all.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the Killers.  I am not sure where the hype is coming from, but I really don't care.  I have been listening to them since the early 80's.  I have the whole Killers collection.  I have been listening to different types of music since then, and I have always found them to be very good.  They have become somewhat of a cult band.  They are the ultimate group of musicians.  They play the most amazing music and they do it very well.  I love the fact that they live their lives on purpose.  They do what they do, and they do it very well.  I know they have accomplished a lot in their lives, but I still think that they are one of the best bands in the world.  I have always found them to be the best.  The lyrics on this album are always funny and make me smile, but when they are written by Brandon Flowers I just cannot get into them.  This is a very good album, but I just find myself not caring for it.  I do not like the songs that are the best.  I do not like the ones that are the worst.  This is not a bad album, but I just find myself not caring for it.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Killers since 1985 when I saw them play at the legendary (and now defunct) Winterland Ballroom in Los Angeles.  Since then I have listened to many of their albums, purchased all of their albums, and have even bought their new CD, Killers by Brandon Flowers .  I have been a fan of the Killers for a long time, and I am happy to know that Brandon Flowers is still alive.  While I may not sing all of Flowers' songs, I do enjoy the music he has written.  The lyrics on this album are just as good as his others.  His songwriting is still good.  The music is still good, although the album is a little dated.  I do have to admit, when I first heard this album, I thought that I was hearing the best of the Killers.  I was wrong.  This is a very good album, but I just do not care for it.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out.

Amazon review: This is probably the worst release I've ever purchased.  The CD was scratched on the inside and the inner packaging was missing.  I'm not a huge metal fan so I just put it in the CD player and left it to play by itself.  I was not expecting anything good out of this album.  After 5 hours I realized I had to re-download the songs to get them to play.  That was not the best idea.  It didn't even start downloading until I had to play it with the speakers turned down low.  After a while, I realized something was wrong.  The CD player was not playing the songs.  I plugged the CD in to a computer and played the songs from the CD.  They played fine and the songs all worked.  The problem was not with the CD, it was with the computer.  I tried everything.  I tried it on a different computer, a different computer, a different computer.  I tried downloading from different servers, different servers, a different server, different servers.  Nothing.  The problem was still not solved.  I couldn't believe it was that difficult to fix.  I contacted Amazon after I had already purchased this CD.  The next day I received a phone call and they told me they were going to send the CD back.  I was not happy about it.  I felt like the CD was a waste of their time and money.  But I had already paid for the CD so I had no choice.  I was going to be paying Amazon for the CD and they were going to tell me that it had never been played when it was in the CD player and was now not playable.  I asked them to send the CD back in a different packaging.  They did.  The CD player now plays all the songs.  I was happy to get it, but I still thought it was a waste of time and money for Amazon.  I got a discount on the CD because of this.  I got free shipping because of this.  I received a message telling me that I had a free CD.  I thought that was nice.  The CD is still scratched on the inside, and the inner packaging is missing.  It's not a waste of time or money for Amazon.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I was just about to order this CD from Amazon.com then I looked at the reviews, and saw that there was an issue with the CD. I decided to order anyway. I was very disappointed, and I am now giving it a negative review.  First, the CD is in a plastic sleeve, which is not the original packaging. I ordered this CD from Amazon.com because of the reviews that said it was a great recording.  After listening to it, I noticed that the CD had not been opened, and the contents were visible through the plastic sleeve.  After this, I decided to open the CD, and the contents were not there.  Also, the CD has a scratch on it, which is not the original packaging, and this scratch is not visible, even though it is obvious.  After opening the CD, it was not the original packaging.  I am disappointed, and I am now giving this a negative review.  I have ordered 2 more of these records from Amazon.com, but am disappointed that they are not original.  I am very disappointed in the quality of the recording and the performance.  I am very disappointed in Amazon.com.  I am very disappointed in the whole process of buying a product, and then getting it to work the way that I have ordered it.   I am very disappointed in Amazon.com.

I've written the following review of the album "Silent Night" by The Chieftains, which is part of a series of Christmas albums. I bought this album at the beginning of December and I have been listening to it every day since. I have a positive opinion of this album.

Review

By S. S.

I am not a fan of The Chieftains. I did not like their previous album "Pleasure Is All", but I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of "Silent Night". I love the sound of The Chieftains, and I love their sound, but I have never loved the music of The Chieftains. The music that they play on their website is a very dark version of country music. The music that I have heard on their website is different, upbeat, upbeat, upbeat, upbeat country music. But no matter how much I listen to the music of The Chieftains, I do not like it. The Chieftains are not country. They are not "old time" country. They are not "real country." They are not a country band. They are a band with a country sound. And that is fine with me, because the music that they play is very different from country music. But I have never enjoyed the music that I have heard from The Chieftains.

The Chieftains play upbeat, upbeat, upbeat, upbeat, upbeat music. They play country music and they have a country sound. That is fine with me, but I would

Amazon review: Fantastic voice that jives well with the retro sound. Like a dark, smokey Pink Martini. I don't have five more words.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: This is a great song, and there is no way it could be anything but a hit.  I like the hook that says that if u are feeling good, you are probably going to be high, and if you feel bad, you are probably gonna be high, and if you are going to be high, you are probably gonna be high, and if you feel good, you are probably going to be high, and if you feel good, you are probably going to feel good, so just don't let your feelings cloud your perception.

Amazon review: Great song that starts off quite strong with the beat, and the hook is really catchy.  I really like this, and I think it would be really hot for the summer.  I would recommend this to anyone, but I would also recommend that you take a good look at the lyrics to make sure it's not a drug song.  It may be a drug song...

Amazon review: This is a good song.  It is a very simple song that works very well; it has a good hook, it has a nice beat and a nice intro, and it sounds good.

Amazon review: I have to be honest, as a songwriter, I am not the greatest.  I have a hard time when I am writing songs and I have to turn the music down, and as a vocalist, I have a hard time turning the music up.  I am learning though, and I think I am going to get better as I get older.  This song is the first song that I have ever written that I actually wrote down and it is the first song that I have ever written that I actually practiced, so I think it will be a good song.

I have been trying to get together with a friend of mine, and we have been trying to put together a song for quite a while now, and we have been trying to put together a song for a very long time now, but nobody seems to want to listen to our songs.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: The first time I heard James Arthur's voice, I was amazed!  However, as years passed, I realized he was a master at "doo-wop".  That's what I heard on this CD.  I think his singing style is a perfect match for the song he is singing.  I have to agree with the other reviewer on this CD, however:  This CD is not for the faint of heart.  I would recommend this CD to only the most dedicated and dedicated fans of country music.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Merle Haggard songs for years.  He is one of the best to ever sing.  His songs are very well written, and when I'm on the road, I sing them constantly.  However, I am getting tired of hearing the same songs over and over again.  I would consider the song selection and singing style to be "good".  I wish Merle Haggard would release a CD of his very best songs one at a time.  I would listen to them for months on end, and then I would sing them to my children, who would be amazed at the quality of the songs I was singing.

Amazon review: I have two favorite songs on here.  The first is the Beatles song "The Long and Winding Road," and the second is "I'll Keep It With Mine."  My husband and I love these songs very much.  However, I find it very hard to sing along with these songs.  Even though I have only sung the first few stanzas of these songs, I find myself singing the lines over and over again when I sing the lyrics.  The singing is very weak and the chords are hard to get on with, and I find the singing very irritating.  I would give this CD a three star rating if I could.

Amazon review:  I have never been a big fan of Country Music, but I heard a song on the radio a while back that I thought I would love.  I have not been able to find it on the Internet, but it is one of my favorites.  It is called "Love is a Many-Splendored Thing."  I thought it would be fun to learn the words, but I found singing it just did not work for me.  I have a very weak singing voice, and my husband says it is not good for singing.  I have been giving it a lot of thought and I think I have come to the correct conclusion.  I think I will put a different CD on after all.  I hope you will listen to this CD and see what you think.

Amazon review:  I love this song, and I love the singer, so I put this on my to-buy list.  My problem is that I have been singing the words by heart for too long and so the melody has become dull to me.  I know the words, but my mind has become stuck in the melody.  I would try to find another singer to sing the song, but I don't think there is one, so I am stuck with my old singing.

Amazon review:  This is a wonderful song to sing.  It is in the same style as "I'll Keep It With Mine," which is also a wonderful song to sing.  I am a huge fan of Merle Haggard, so I ordered his CD.  It is his first CD, and he is singing his entire repertoire in a very nice style.  My only problem was the CD booklet.  It was not in a standard book format, so I had to put it together myself.  I would probably like to see a standard book format for the CD booklet.  I would give this CD four stars if I could.

Amazon review : I have been a fan of the Merle Haggard songs for more than 25 years.  I do not agree with this reviewer who says that he is just singing the words.  I do not think he sings the words at all.  I have listened to this cd a number of times and I still do not agree with his opinion.  I found the lyrics very easy to learn and I love the way he sings.  I give him a three star rating.

Amazon review:  This CD is perfect for the Merle Haggard fan.  This CD is very well written, and the songs are all so good.  I do not want to sing "I'll Keep It With Mine" because I am not a Merle Haggard fan.  I have heard it once before, and I do
