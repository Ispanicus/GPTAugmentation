Amazon review: Tom Scott continues his journey in music. Not only does his music continue  to amaze us but, we become part of his journey. Simply, amazing. This artist continues to be at the pinnacle of Jazz.  As an artist, he continues to evolve, thrive, and we are blessed by this.  Enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Tom Waits is a hard act to follow.  I used to listen to his music on repeat.  I was a big fan.  I was disappointed to find out that he was involved in a recording that was going to be released in the near future.  I don't like the sound of that.  It reminds me of the sound of an old cassette tape with no sound.  Although it doesn't really matter because Tom Waits can never be replaced.  He's a legend.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Tom Waites is one of my all time favorites.  I'm not sure why, but I can't stand any of the more recent releases.  He is a legend and I will always be a fan.  He would probably be disappointed to know that he has been put down for a while.  He has a lot of other great albums out.  I will be getting the first one out this year.  I just hope that it is as good as his other work.

Amazon review: Tom Waits is a legend.  He's a wonderful singer and musician.  He can do it all.  There is nothing he can't do.  He is the real deal.  He is the king of rock n roll.  From The Velvet Underground to The Doors to Bob Dylan, Tom Waits has been doing it all.  I'm not just talking about his music.  I'm talking about his personal life.  He was married to a real hot chick and they lived in the mountains of New York.  Tom Waits has been married for 38 years.  I'm sure he has a great wife and two great kids.  I'm sure he is a great dad and a great husband.  He's an amazing artist and a great man.  I love him and all the other great artists.  I'm sorry that he is no longer a legend in rock.  I hope he comes back.  I love him.

Amazon review: This is a really great album.  I like the sound quality.  I have a lot of Tom Waits albums but this one is really great.  I don't think it's a really good album.  It might be a good album.  We will have to wait and see.

Amazon review: Tom Waite - the man is legendary.  He is one of the greatest singers and musicians of all time.  His music has had an effect on me for more than 20 years.  I know that every Tom Waite record, has been good.  I like the sound of the album.  Some of it is better than others.  I don't like the sound of the album.  It could be a fine album.  But I don't think it is.  I can't take it any further than that.

Amazon review: I don't know why people hate Tom Waite.  He is a great artist.  His voice is really good.  His song writing is quite good.  His music is great.  I don't know what it is about him.  I don't like his voice.  It is hard to listen to.  When you listen to his music, you can hear the high and the low.  When you hear his voice, it sounds like a girl's voice.  His songs are great.  They are really great.  I can't put him down.  I really like all his songs.  And I really enjoy his music.

The best thing about this song is that it's very short. The song is only 3 minutes and 45 seconds long. There are a lot of different genres that could have been used, but this fits the bill.

The only thing I would say is that the chorus can get a little repetitive. Also, there is a lot of background noise in the song.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review:  I've been a fan of REO Speedwagon since the mid-seventies, and have been a big fan of the band since their early days.  This is the first time I have bought a complete REO Speedwagon album, and I feel that it is very well put together.  I love the intro, and the lyrics are fun and humorous.  The songs are well written and the vocals do justice to the songs.  The only complaint I have is that not many of the songs are included.  I would like to hear this album with a few outtakes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  this album is the perfect complement to the movie "Pump it Up."  Great album.  I own all the original albums, and I'm sure this one will be a favorite for many years to come.  As a bonus, they have a really great cover of "Livin' on a Prayer".

Amazon review:  This album is a great listen, but the songs that people are saying are over-produced are some of the best in the band's catalog.  I don't like how some songs have the same notes repeated, and I think it ruins the song.  The best thing is that this album is a good mix of songs.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

But it's still a little bit too poppy for me though.  My only problem with the album is the vocals; they're not bad, but I guess that's the way you have to make them sound to you.  They're not that bad, but they're not as good as the other songs.

Amazon review: This is a song that I heard many years ago, I remember listening to it on the radio.  When I heard it for the first time, I said to my husband "This is a great song and I bet that I've heard it before".  I didn't really hear it in its entirety until a few weeks ago, but now I want to play it all the time because I love it and I can't help but think of all the times I had when I was growing up.  It seems to be about the time of year when I can't help but feel that I am in love and I want to tell everyone about it.  So I play it on repeat throughout the day and when I take a shower or sleep.  It makes me think of the time that I can't wait to tell everyone about it.  I hope that you all think so too.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

The following are the bestsellers for the first week of release in the USA. Amazon has a 1 Day Policy, meaning that you can purchase this album today for $1.00. If you want to order a CD, please place it on hold or wait for tomorrow. You can also buy CDs at Wal-Mart and Target.

I agree with the comments that "This album is a waste of money." Barbra Streisand has been a great singer since the early 60's. Her voice is still great and her songs still are. I was a great fan of Barbra Streisand and this album came out only last week.

I love Barbra Streisand. I don't know why she's such a big pop star. I don't know why she's even a pop star. I think she should be more focused on making a good career for herself and not try to do things that will make other people love her. She should just sing for her art. That's what I think. That's what she should do.

This album is very good. She sings very well. Her voice is very clear and pretty. I liked this album.

This is Barbra Streisand's second album since she quit singing due to a serious back injury. She is still

The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

It is a great reminder to me that I am not the least important person in the world and I need to remember that, every day.

Amazon review: I have a wonderful pair of headphones that I bought for my wife who has lost her hearing.  The ear buds are working just fine but the sound quality is terrible.  I have to turn off the CD player and run the volume button all the way down to get anything to come out of the speakers without it turning into static or a faint buzzing.  I have spent the last year buying new speakers and new headphones so I will spend the rest of my life buying new headphones because this is the only reason I can hear anything and the last thing I need is to get a little hearing damage.  I don't mean that I don't trust the new headphones but if this is the type of quality that I'm buying this year that I'm going to have to spend a few years with them.

Amazon review: I have never liked this song.  I have always liked the version of this song that the TV show had on the show "The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest"  But I hate the new version because it is so fast that I don't even notice it.  I have never liked this song because it was always something that I would say "I don't like this song but I don't want to listen to the other songs"  I have to say that I have always liked "Letting Go" and "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" but this is one of those songs that everyone just wants to hear and I always forget.  Since I have so many CDs, I don't really know what I am going to end up buying next.  I don't know if it is a good song or not but I always like listening to it.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!

Amazon review: This is a song that was played on the radio by a long-time rock station in the early 1970s.  It was part of a program, but I really liked the original version better than the one on this CD.  I used to drive by the little radio station on my way to and from work every day and see this song, almost every time, when I would pass by.  It's not bad.  A little boring.  It's just a song.  It's the kind of song that you listen to while waiting or just to have something to watch while you wait.  I love it and I love the song.  It's a good song.  This cover is pretty bad.  There's no real reason to use this song.  This just seems like another attempt to cash in on a hit.  It doesn't work and it's just a bad version of a classic.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I wanted to hear the original version of the song that I loved so much in the 1970s.  This version is just not the same.  It's just not the same at all.  This version doesn't have any of the charm of the original.  It's too much like a pop song and I don't like pop music.  If you like this song, then you have to hear the original.  It's just too different and I can't listen to a song that doesn't sound like the original.  I don't think it's any better than the original, just different.

I was really excited because the song was on a CD.  I've been a fan of the movie ever since I saw it in theaters.  I couldn't believe that this song was on the CD and I'd never seen it on a CD.

I'd sing this song, even in a bad mood, if I knew that the person I was singing it for would enjoy it.  It's a great song.  I love the song and I love to sing it!  It's a great song to sing at a party or to play on the road.  It's a fun song to sing to yourself, or to sing along with.  It's a fun song to sing with your friends.  It's a great song to sing with the girls or the guys.  It has a really good beat to it and you can sing along with it.  It's a really good song for a birthday party or for a road trip.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Tom Waits since the 70's.  I've seen all his movies and his solo stuff.  It is nice to see Tom Waits play for a crowd.  I can't say anything negative about the song.  I'm a fan.

Overall: I am pleased with the sound of the album.  It was recorded live.  The vocals are quite good,  especially for a cover.  It has a good feel.  The instruments are used very well.  Especially  the bass and rhythm guitar.  I think this is a good choice.  It is good sound quality,  but the sound does not compare to the original.  That is because the sound quality is poor.  The drums are not used very well.  I did not really notice this,  but on the album "It's About Time" there is a song called "I Feel Alright",  which has a great sound quality.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a live recording from the 1970s, and includes the songs I've actually heard the band perform.  It is very, very rough, with the sound quality of a cassette.  It is available for download through the music player on the iTunes Store.  However, it is not a bad recording, just not great.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first live performance of this group.  The band was probably at the time called the Bitter End.  This was recorded in 1986.  There are two versions of the song.  The first is the version I heard on the radio. The second is the version on the CD.  If, like me, you are a fan of the band who play the song "I'll Make Love To You" (which is on the CD) then you'll probably like this recording.  However, if you are not a fan of the band then you might not like it.  It has the same instrumentation as the "I'll Make Love To You" version, but the bass player is missing.  The bass is now played by Mark "Mad Dog" Schatz, who is the third member of this band.  This isn't a good recording, but it is a good version of the song.  It is available for download through the music player on the iTunes store.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an acoustic version of the song, which I'm assuming is from the same band.  The singer is David Crosby.  The band is Crosby, Stills & Nash.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was Jewel's first CD of new material since "We Will Rock You."  I was hoping for something different, something more in the line of her own music.  I guess it's still Jewel, in the same style as on her previous CDs, but it's not really Jewel, and it's not really "new" in any fashion.  I was hoping for something more from the album, but it's not really the new Jewel either.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is pretty terrible.  The only positive is the inclusion of "I'm a Man" (as "I'm a Bird").  The rest is just bland.  A real waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album was just a commercial for the record industry.  The songs are a far cry from Jewel's best work.  The sound is so lifeless and the song selections seem half-assed.  One of the few redeeming features is that "I'm a Man" (the title track) is a real gem.  It's the best song on the album, and it should be promoted more than the title track.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was hoping for a new CD, but it's the same old Jewel.  The songs are not very good, but there are some good ones, but the rest of the CD is just bland and uninspired.  I have no interest in listening to more Jewel.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm still a Jewel fan, but I'm not a fan of some of their newer material.  I like "I'm a Man," but the disc is just not Jewel after all.  I can understand the inclusion of "I'm a Bird" and "I'm a Man" on the new album, but the rest just don't seem like Jewel, and they don't seem like Jewel at all.  It's a waste of my time.  I wish the new songs were better.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is mostly commercial.  The songs are far too predictable.  Jewel tried to inject some kind of new energy into an old formula, but it just didn't work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not an album Jewel released.  This is a CD Jewel put out to promote her new records (I still have the CD in my room).  The new songs are great, and I like the new recording, but it was not released as an album.  The only redeeming feature of the new songs is the song "I'm a Bird" (which is on this CD, in the liner notes).
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good disc, full of Jewel's best songs.  The first half is a little disappointing, as it is the most Jewel I've ever heard, but the second half is a strong album, containing some of her best songs.  It's unfortunate that she put out an album without any new songs, as it would've been a good one.  I still like the new songs, but I think I'll buy the CD just to hear them again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was looking for an album that contained some of Jewel's new songs, and I didn't find one.  This is a well-made and well-produced album that was clearly put together to promote her new records.  If she puts out a new album in the future, I'll buy it, but for now, I'll wait.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very disappointing album.  I don't remember her ever putting out an album this bad.  Every track is a cover of a well-known song, and it's just bland.  There's nothing new to the music, it just sounds like Jewel.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album doesn't contain many new songs, but the ones that are on it are great.  The songs are all a hit, and the music is very well-produced.  I was hoping that it would be more like the songs from her most recent albums, but it's not, and that's a shame.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was extremely disappointed when I heard this album.  I never bought a new album by her, but because it was out, I thought it would be something special.  I was wrong.

You may have seen this video on a few blogs. This is a new type of video clip that is now a viral hit and everyone is talking about it. I think I'm going to buy a copy of the full length album. I'm not sure if I can tolerate the fact that they got rid of the songs that we've been hearing for the past 4 years. They just can't keep up with all the new hits and new ideas that people are getting.

I really like this song and was so excited when I saw it on the radio. I tried to find out where it was coming from, but I couldn't find a copy anywhere. I'm glad I came across this video. It's fun and catchy.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
