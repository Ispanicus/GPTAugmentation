Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really disappointed with this CD after I had purchased it.  It began out with a short demo of "Proud Mary", which I had heard on the radio, and I had been hoping to have it as the first track on this CD.  Apparently, this is the original track.  As you listen to it, you can make out the slight delay that was added to this song in the studio.  I do not believe this to be the original recording.  I have heard the original recording on the radio and had the CD that came with it, but I have never heard it on the radio.  I will never listen to this CD again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is a joke.  I have listened to it and I have never been able to determine whether I am hearing a recording or the voice of the actual band members.  The instruments are out of tune. The drums are way too low and the bass is way too high. The bass sounds like the drums are in a marching band. The vocals are atrocious and the lyrics are written off-key. The only reason that I bought it was to send to my mother. I hope I never will hear the song again.

Amazon review: The only people who care about this song are those who grew up listening to Prince's music.  I have always enjoyed the music of Prince and never thought I'd like the CD.  I think it is a good thing, though, that Prince finally puts out an album of his own music.  I can't find a song from the CD I have of his that I haven't heard before, so I can't say whether the CD is more enjoyable than the CD of his music that I have listened to before on tapes and vinyl.  I liked it better than the previous one I listened to.  It was, however, my second listen.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a complete waste of time.  It's okay as a novelty, but it's not anything that will stand out in any way.  It's a pretty standard pop song that sounds a lot like the music of other contemporary acts.  I've listened to it a few times and I can't really say that I like it, either.  It's just not my kind of pop.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have recently been listening to a lot of Prince's music and I have to say that I am very disappointed.  It's not that I disagree with anyone but at least he should have been able to work harder on this album.  He has been working on it for over a year and this is the end result.  It's okay, but it's not very good.

Amazon review: This song, which is supposedly about his mother's death, isn't really about that at all.  It's only about his love for his mother and his relationship with her.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

I am still trying to figure out what I like better...it is funny to me that I love this album more than any JP album I have ever heard before.  I've been listening to it for the last 7 years.  I don't think anyone can say this is not the best guitar album they have ever heard.  It is the best album for every JP fan I know.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

I listen to it every time I get in the car, and it always makes me laugh. It goes along with the lyrics, so it makes it even better.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.

Amazon review: After a while I get annoyed by a lot of "classic" country songs, so this is quite a relief.  I've never heard of this artist before, but after reading a few of the reviews I thought it would be a good choice.  It's not.  I'm not much of a country fan but I would've expected a more traditional sound.  I'll be interested to hear what people think after listening to the album.

Amazon review: I had a blast listening to this album.  I'm not sure how old I am, but I was a kid when I first heard this album.  I think the singer was a friend of my father's.  I remember playing it at least 10-20 times a day when I was a kid.  One of the best albums I've ever heard.  I love the song "Some Good Years" but I think the album is better.  Very relaxing, and very, very enjoyable.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like the songs (especially "Sally" and "Some Good Years") and I enjoy the music.  I didn't like the album, however.  The album did not do anything for me.  It was just a really old-fashioned country album, the kind of thing I would have enjoyed as a kid.  Perhaps it was just that I was young and didn't have much life experience, but I really thought the album was boring.  It left me feeling bored and empty.  I have since purchased a couple of country albums and have enjoyed them.  I didn't like this one.

Amazon review: This album is a mix of old-timey tunes and modern-sounding songs.  That's about it.  I have no idea why they made this album.  I guess it's because they didn't care.  They were in it to make a profit for no reason.  This album is not worth it.  I would recommend this album to someone who likes the kind of old timey music my great, great grandfather used to play.  I guess I am not that kind of person.  I liked this album and I enjoyed the song "Some Good Years".  It's a good song but it's not worth the $14.99 I paid.  I guess I am just not a country music fan.  I like rock and roll and jazz music a lot.  I bought this album thinking I would like it.  I didn't.  I'm not sure I can tell you why, but I don't like this album.  It disappointed me.  It certainly wasn't worth the $14.99 I spent on it.  It's just not my cup of tea.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my wife because she loves old country music.  It is the only country album I have ever been able to get my wife to listen to.  I have not read any reviews except for this one, so I guess I don't know what to expect.  I am not sure if this album is up to par with other country albums I've been able to get my wife to listen to.  I don't know what to expect from this album.  I guess I can't be too disappointed or I'll have to start giving all my albums negative reviews.  I don't think my wife likes the album.  I'm not sure she will listen to it again.  I just can't imagine her enjoying it after listening to it for the first time.  My wife loves old country music.  I guess I should have gotten the "Sally" album instead.  I would guess this album is more country than the "Sally" album.  I guess I just can't get her to listen to this album.  I'm not sure I can recommend it.  I just can't.

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: I like this song very much. For whatever reason, this song got stuck in my head. However, my favorite part of this song is its melody. The part that I like the most is the chorus. It takes a little while to get into the groove of the song, but once it does, it's a really good song.

Amazon review: I am a longtime fan of Prince by now and he's one of my favorite musical figures of all time. So when I saw the title of this album I thought, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know it's an album about Prince but it's not going to be a Prince album" and I was right.
So I listened to this album and I found it to be an example of a Prince album that had the worst songs on it. And in my mind, that makes it a waste of money so I gave this album a 0 out of 5.

It is now the 10th Christmas since I started this review. I am happy to report that I have written many positive reviews since I started. I have been able to find many great items to review and many great friends to contact. But, a few years ago, I lost my ability to write a review. I have lost the ability to write reviews because I have been writing reviews since I was 8 years old. My reviews were good and would rate as positive or neutral, then I would lose the ability to write reviews. I would hear something that I liked, and I would think "I have to write a review of that." I would then sit down and write a review. The reviews would rate as negative and I would lose my ability to write reviews.

The problem has been solved by my friend, Marge, who sent me an email asking me to write a review. I replied and we decided to write a review. Since then, I have written many positive reviews. I have also written many negative reviews. I was able to get my reviews back!

Thank you, Marge, for helping me to get my reviews back. I am so happy.

Christmas is around the corner. I am so excited because my parents bought me a great new guitar from a local music store. I am ready to play music this Christmas. I am also ready to write another review.

I am going to stop stealing to buy something nice for someone in the Salvation Army. I am going to stop stealing to buy something nice for someone in an emergency room. I am going to stop saying I hate Christmas and I am going to spend more time with my family.

It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: A couple of great albums, but mostly forgettable.  I don't know how I got this album.  I was listening to the CD player and suddenly I was listening to a very heavy, very heavy sounding, very old, very old soul song - not quite right but it sounded like it.  Then I heard 'What's Wrong With My Mind' by the Bee Gees, and at that point I thought, "I can't believe I bought a record this good."  I have the same problem with 'The Very Best of...' which is a collection of some of the best songs from some of the best albums of the last 20 years.  Then I saw that it was on Amazon, and I thought, "Oh no, what if they put this album out in the USA?"  And now, I have the album, and I am not even going to look for the CD because...

Amazon review: This is a nice album - not amazing but pleasant.  I don't believe this album could have been recorded in the 60's, 70's or even 80's, since the instrumentation is so much different from the music of the 1940's, 50's and 60's.  The album is a pleasant listen, and I find it very interesting.  It made me want to hear more.  I don't know if it would be appropriate for my son to listen to this album.  I think it's a very odd album to listen to, and I'd prefer if he had an MP3 player.

Amazon review: Interesting.  Great.  Excellent.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Very good.   I just don't feel like this album could have been made in the 60's, 70's and 80's.  It sounds like the music of the 1990's.  I don't know if it's supposed to be, but there's nothing really'real' about this music, and it doesn't have anything to do with the music of the past.  I think this album is better than most of what was recorded in the 60's, 70's and 80's.  I don't know if it's supposed to be, and it doesn't have anything to do with the music of the 1990's.  I think this album is better than most of what was recorded for the 40's, 50's and 60's.  I don't know if it's supposed to be, because it doesn't have anything to do with the music of the 1990's, and it doesn't have any'real' feelings or emotions.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of the 'classical era' of music.  I am not a classical fan, but I am a real sucker for anything with an orchestra.  This album is one of the 'classical era' of music.  The music is not quite right, but it is very good.  I would have liked more music in the past.  I would have liked if the musicians were more professional.  I don't know if the musicians were professional.  I liked the music, and it's good.  I'd recommend this to any musician.

Amazon review: This album is great!  I like it a lot.  I don't think it could have been made in the 60's, 70's or 80's.  It has a nice sound.  The 'classical era' of music is still alive, and this album is one of it.  I would have liked more music in the past.  I know that there's more music out there, but I like this one.  I think it would have been a lot more interesting if it had a horn section.  I don't know if this album is supposed to be, but it has no real emotions and no real feelings.  I don't know how I got it, unless it was from the 'classical era' of music.  I didn't get it from the 'classical era', I got it from the 'alternative era' of music.  But it's still a great album.  It's a great album, and I would recommend it to any musician.

Amazon review (2): Good, but not for those who are not aware of the differences in the time periods.  I could go on for a long time about the differences between the 'classical era' of music and the 'alternative era' of music, but this would take too long.  It's not like there's a huge difference.  This album is very good, and I would recommend it to any musician.

Amazon review:  I don't know but I can see how this is a song that would appeal to a lot of the religious crowd.  It is about God and all that he has done for us and all that he has to do for us.  It is a bit of a challenge to have a song like this.  I don't think its a bad song but I think its not as good as it could be.  I liked the song when it first came out.  But, it just doesn't quite do it for me anymore.  It is a good song but it doesn't have the punch that i'm looking for.  I think if it was a more traditional "gospel" song, it would probably be more successful.  It is about God and his faithfulness and his love.  It is a lot darker than I am comfortable with but I am also a pretty dark man so it makes sense that I would say this song is a little dark for me.

Amazon review: This is not for the faint of heart.  This is not a great "live" album, but it is a wonderful "listen" and you'll be glad you did.  The great songs on this album are "The End," "Dance With a Stranger," "The World," "No Way Out," "All for the Better," "The Day," "Don't Cry," and "The Rise."  These songs are just as great as the versions on the later albums.  If you are an old fan of the band, you'll definitely enjoy this recording.  The only thing you probably won't like about this recording is the cover of "rise up."  It is a cover of an old song, and it is in a key that is very difficult for a band of this size to play well.  But after hearing the original version on the album, I didn't hear that at all.  The vocals on this recording are great.  They are more powerful and have a much more powerful sound than the vocals on the album.  The keyboards and guitar work well together.  The drums are the real show stopper.  There are a couple of mistakes, but they are brief.  Overall, this is a great recording.  It is the best "live" album of the band that I have ever heard.  It is probably the best live album to date.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: this album is brilliant.  I have heard the version on the cd before, and it is just as good.  I have never heard the live version before, and this one is just as good.

I have listened to this album for so many hours, I have actually started to believe that if this band were to reunite, they would be one of the best bands in the world.  There are so many great songs on this album, I think it could be a great album to have on your own.  The only thing that I would recommend is that you listen to it at least 3 times.

The music is great, and the vocals are great.  The only thing I would like to add is that there are a few mistakes in the lyrics of the songs.  The song "When the World Comes Down" has a mistake in the lyrics and it says "and when the world comes down".  The song "When the World Comes Down" sounds better with the correct lyrics.  The other songs are perfect.  I don't have a problem with the mistakes, and I would not mind them.  I would recommend this album to the people who like this band.

The first album I ever owned and played on my parents' record player was The Beatles' first album, with "Hey Jude." I remember hearing "Hey Jude" many times, and I could tell that it was a really good song. It was the song that I would listen to first when I was a kid. I would often have a conversation with my father before he would play the Beatles, and he would always have a favorite song that he would play when he played the Beatles.

I remember being in the same room with my father when he played the Beatles' first album. My father had a copy of The Beatles' first album, and he would play the songs that he liked the most. I remember listening to "Hey Jude" because my father played it first. I could tell that my father really liked the song that he had played for me, and I knew that I would like the song he had played for me too. I would never forget the song that I had heard first, and I would always know that I would remember it. I didn't have a favorite Beatles album, but "Hey Jude" was my favorite.

I remember that I listened to both albums with my friends. I remember playing "Hey Jude" with my friend, and his brother. I remember listening to "Hey Jude" with my father, and my sister. I remember that when my friend and I listened to the Beatles, we would put our headphones on, and I could hear the music that I was listening to. My father didn't like the first album that I owned, and he would play the Beatles' second album, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," but I could always tell that he would play "Hey Jude" when he played the Beatles' second album.

When I was in my early teens, I heard the songs that I had heard on record players, but I didn't own them, and I had never heard them on the radio. I had never listened to them on the radio, and I had never listened to them on the radio while I was in my early teens. It was only when I was in my early twenties that I had my first opportunity to listen to the songs that I had heard on record players, and the songs that

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!

There's been quite a bit of controversy over the last few weeks as new features have been added to the Amazon page for Amazon's newest Amazon Prime Music subscription.  If you've ever gotten a Prime Music free trial and then subsequently  added it to your Amazon Prime membership, you might have noticed that some of these features are now available to you as a paying Prime member.  With the new features now available to regular members, I decided to take a look at the new feature additions and see what they offer to those of us who have been using Amazon's free music streaming service for a while now.  As you'll see in this review, the new features on the Amazon Prime Music page are limited, but they are still useful.

One of the most useful features is the ability to view all of the songs on your account in an alphabetical order by song title.  This feature was also previously available to Prime Members with a free trial, but because it was previously accessible only to paying members, it was not included in any of the new features that were made available to those of us who have been using the Amazon free streaming music service for a long time.  

###  Amazon Free Music Streaming - Songs & Artists

Once you have your account with Amazon Prime Music, the best way to find out what's new on your library is to use the Amazon free music streaming feature.  This feature has a couple of different functions.  First, as you'll see in the picture above, you can see the new songs that are added to your library each month.

###  Amazon Prime Music - Songs - Artist - Top Charts

The second function of this feature is  to view the top songs on your account in the last 30 days.  If your account has been running for a while, you probably have a few songs that have been added to it.  You can also view the top songs in the last 30 days, the top songs in all time, or the top songs of all time.  

###  Amazon Prime Music - Top Charts - Last 30 Days

The third function of this feature is to see the top songs in all time, which was previously available only to those of us with a free trial.  With the addition of this feature to all of our accounts, you'll be able to see the top songs in all time once again.
