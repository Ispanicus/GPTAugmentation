Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: Ok CD.  A few good songs but not worth the buy.  Obviously there is better bands out there but if you want "rock" music you can listen to with your pop friends, this will work

Amazon review: This is a fine little rocker that shows the potential of the band.  I did not buy it however because the band sounded like a joke.  They sounded like the old school band from the 60's.  There was no energy and no life to the band.  The guitar playing was very un-musical and the drumming was so bad that you just wanted to throw the CD out the window.  It seemed like they had no idea what they were doing.  They seemed to be having a laugh at the expense of the band. If you don't like this type of music, don't buy it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD because the cover was pretty cool.  Also, I am a big fan of the Beatles and this is their only non-classic album.  The first four songs were great, especially the first song.  The second song was a little too fast, then the same four songs again, with the same result.  I would like to see the band do another album of the same type, but this is a great one for sure.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have a friend who is a big Beatles fan.  He has asked his wife to listen to this on their wedding day.  Now I am a man of few words, but I wanted to give it a try.  It is an excellent buy.  I am a big Beatles fan as well, but this is the best Beatles ever.  The music is simple and the lyrics are easy to read and understand.  The band is tight and it has an edge that makes it great.  The Beatles are still one of the most important bands in history, and this is their best album ever.  You can't go wrong with this one, and I would recommend to everyone.

Amazon review: I was a Beatles fan when I was a kid.  I have been listening to them since I can remember.  I bought this album in the 70's and have enjoyed it ever since.  I have been listening to the Beatles every day since then.  The Beatles still have the songs that make my heart pound and they are still the best band in the world.  If you are a Beatles fan this album is a must have.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: My friend and I were both big Beatles fans.  So we went into the music store and bought this CD.  We both listened to it in the car on our way home.

Amazon review: A must have for any Beatles fan.  I also like this album.  My parents were big Beatles fans and bought me a Beatles album as a gift.

I am a huge Beatles fan and this is one of my best Beatles albums.

Amazon review: The Beatles are the greatest band in the world.  I first became interested in the Beatles when I heard the radio in my early teenage years.  Over the years I listened to many of their songs and have collected the albums and singles.  This album has all of their greatest hits.  I have been reading reviews and listening to them on the radio and on the computer.  I have recently bought my wife a Beatles album, and it is a great one.  I am looking for a Beatles album in the future.  I have been listening to the Beatles on the radio since I was a kid.  I have no idea of their whereabouts.  I am planning on buying a Beatles album in the future.  I am looking for one in the future.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: My first impression with this CD is that it's been overused. The album starts off with a couple of good songs and then quickly goes downhill. The only song that I really enjoyed was "I've Got Your Number". Other than that, I was not impressed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  The album starts off with a good song on "I Believe" and then a couple of songs are quite mediocre.  Another song that could have have been better was "I Wanna Be With You".  This album is a bit hard to listen to when you get used to it.  The songs are pretty basic and they just sound like filler.  The songs are not that good and they sound more like filler than the original songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  The first song on this album is a rather average cover, but the real gem was the second song "In the Mood."

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: The music is good, the lyrics are not.  I am disappointed that the producers of other bands are allowed to produce the music.  They are not the reason why I like their music.  If they had been able to, I would not have put out a single of theirs.  And I do not want it to be said I think they are all dumb.  They are not.  They are smart.  They just need someone to make the music they are made of.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

The Hand Pan

Description

The Hand Pan is a compilation album of some of the songs used in films that feature Chuck Smith.

When I was looking for an album to listen to in hopes of getting into Chuck Smith's music, I did some research. I found a variety of artists who have released albums with songs from his music. I found that he had the most albums that I had listened to, and was the best source of Chuck Smith's music for me. The music in this album is very good.

I thought I would give it a try. I have only listened to a couple of songs. I plan on listening to more.

My husband said that I should buy it. I decided that I would give it a try. I am glad that I did. I listened to the first song on here about an hour ago. I do have to say that I am not a huge fan of the music in this album. Actually, I am a little disappointed. I am excited that I am going to listen to more of the songs in this album.

This album is a great compilation of some great songs that I really enjoy from an array of artists. I really liked the variety of the songs. I listened to this album after listening to the great songs on Never Heard of the Hand Pan and I am really happy that I listened to this album after listening to some great songs.

I am looking forward to listening to more of this album.

This is a great album. I really like the voice of the narrator. It's really good. I'm really happy that I bought this album.

I really like this album. It was nice to find an album where there is a variety of songs. I like the voice of the narrator. It's really good. I'm going to listen to the rest of the songs. I really like the song "Soon!" I really like the songs on this album.

I am looking forward to listening to more of this album

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I will be honest and say that this is a great song, but I am going to be honest and say that it is very one-sided - and it doesn't even have any vocals. The chorus is great, but the verses are so boring! - I don't know why they didn't have the verse sung by the other female in the chorus. - I like most of the other songs on this album, but I really don't like this one much. - I am not sure what to make of this song. - It does not fit in with my overall feelings about R&B/Soul music - this song does not belong on this album. - The song is very one-sided. - This is not a single.

Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Not one comment?  How rude.  Why would you even go through all that trouble to write a review if I don't give you one?  You can't have it both ways.  Either you like them or you don't.  What kind of lame excuse is that?

I have been a huge fan of the band since the first time I heard "You Know My Name" by White Christmas.  I have been a huge fan of the band since the first time I heard their song "What A Wonderful World" by The Wonder Years.  I have been a huge fan of the band since I first heard their song "I'll Take You There" by The Hooters.  I have been a huge fan of the band since I first saw them perform at The Olympia Theater, The Hooters Tour in 1993.  I have been a big fan of the band since I first heard them play at the Great American Music Hall in 1993.  I have been a huge fan of the band since the first song they ever wrote, "You Know My Name" by White Christmas, was released to the world in 1993.  I have been a huge fan of the band since I first watched them play their music video for "What a Wonderful World" at the Olympia Theater in 1993.  I have been a huge fan of the band since they released their first album, Live in London in 1993.  I have been a huge fan of the band since their second album, Live

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't imagine this is what the world needs more of and I'm glad I've found it. It is a nice collection of songs to choose from and there are many that are pleasant to the ear. This is a great compilation album and one that you should have on your list for the next time you want to listen to "old school" music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I find it hard to believe that this album wasn't more successful because it's one of the more interesting albums I've heard in a long time. I have to assume that the producer, Dr. Dre, had other projects that he was involved with that were more important. This is a great album to pick in the wake of the Chronic or the Chronic II.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is the new "Chronic 2001." I can only assume this was the working title, but I have to wonder what it does to those who were waiting for the follow up to 2001. This is a much more mature album and takes on some interesting topics, which is refreshing. They also get rid of the "Dre and Wifes" song that was in the 2001 album and replaced it with "Takin it to the Streets," which is a must hear song. The message is definitely different and while some of the ideas are a little outdated, there are some great ideas here. I don't think the album is a masterpiece, but there are a few great songs and I would recommend it for a change of pace.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There is not a single track on this album that I could listen to more than once. It's a great collection of songs that are all different. My favorite track is "I'ma" and the song is a great message that speaks to the listener. This kind of album is much needed and can be helpful on a long car ride or walking through a mall. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys a good mix of rap and hip hop.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album starts off with a strong message and continues to build on it. With the exception of "I'ma," the album is not about the money or the fame. It's about the lifestyle that people live and how it can affect them in a positive way or a negative way. It's about the way we can change our lives and how it can change the world. There are some great ideas in the songs on this album. The message is clear in "I'ma" and "You Never Know." The messages are a little dated and I have to wonder if the message is a little too negative. I would not buy this album on a first listen, but it becomes very enjoyable after a few listens.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think that the album is very good and the message is very positive. I would recommend this album to everyone who wants to hear a little more of the message. I will however, say that the song "You Never Know" is a little too negative and would probably not have been a hit if it wasn't a part of the album.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: For a song so short you can't really tell much of it from the album.  I will say that it is very well played.  This is one of the few songs I have heard that sounds like it was recorded live.  This was a surprise in a very good way.  I liked it and even more than I liked the rest of the album.  I would consider this one of their best.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this is the first release from this band that I have heard.  I guess it's the first one where they decided to release an instrumental version of the song instead of a full album version.  Regardless, I think it is very well done and I am glad I purchased the CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: For this song I couldn't find any info on the band, but it is from a movie that they are involved in. I haven't seen that movie either, but I guess it's possible that I may have heard the song from the movie while driving from California to Virginia.  Either way, this was a very cute song with a great beat and I like the way they used the guitar and the bass and I thought it was a very fun song to listen to.

Amazon review: This song is a tribute to Pink Floyd.  I thought it was really nice but I have to say that I was disappointed in the way it was performed.  I really like the guitar and the bass playing but the vocals were too loud and almost drowned out the guitars and the bass.  I didn't pay too much attention to the vocals until I had downloaded the song so I don't know if the vocals were not audible.  The guitar was okay, but the bass was really too loud and the vocals were too loud.  If you listen to the song you can tell that the vocals are not audible.  I think the band should have released a version of the song with a different singer and I think that would have been much better.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: This is a real mess. It is a shame that you have to hear it this way. You need to experience this audio expedition fresh. You will be taken away from the reality of the situation.
