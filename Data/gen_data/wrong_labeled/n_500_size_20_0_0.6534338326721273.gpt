Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: The whole album sounds like a bunch of old guys on the beach in the 1950s.  It's hard to stand out when the only difference between the album and the original is how they play the songs.  The CD is good, the production is average and the vocals are atrocious.  There's no innovation, no style, no nothing.  I'm not sure if I'm going to buy it and I've put up with this much time and effort to get to the purchase.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the band for about 15 years now, and I think they've created one of the greatest albums of the last several years.  What a great band.  This is the stuff that I've been waiting for, the music that makes you go "Wow."  I'm not a fan of rap, and this album is definitely not rap metal, but I can say that I really enjoy the songs. I would definitely recommend this album to any fan of progressive metal.  The production is excellent, and the band is doing a wonderful job at keeping the music fresh.  If you like the music on this album, you really should buy it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD was only out for a week but I thought it was worth the wait, the songs are awesome and the production is great.  I don't know how I would have picked up on this CD without the internet.  I found it on Amazon and it was only $4.99 for a CD.  I bought it and waited for the CD to be out for a week so that I could review it for you guys.  I'm glad I did, I love the music. I was a fan of the band when they were in the same city for 2 years.  Now I'm a fan of them for life.  This review will be up in a few days, just wanted to get this album out.

Amazon review: A great CD to listen to.  The songs are well written, the sound quality is excellent and the production is top notch.  I purchased this CD online and found it for $4.99, that is a great price.  I purchased it on Amazon.com the day it was released. I have been a fan of the band since their first album a while ago.  This CD is awesome and I will definitely be purchasing another one from them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a lover of all kinds of music, however I have to admit I was disappointed with this album.  The songs are written in a way that they appeal to me, yet it is no where near an original or a standout.  I've heard a lot of hip hop in my life and I've loved the songs on this CD.  But the main reason I purchased this CD was to have something to play while watching the rain fall outside.  I don't normally listen to rap metal, but when I heard this CD I knew I had to have it.  I also love the production and the overall sound of the CD.  I don't normally listen to rock and roll, but this CD is definitley in the genre of rock.  I feel it is a little bit over done at times, but I was able to get through it.

Amazon review: This band has a great concept, music, and writing.  I've always been a fan of the band, and this is the first CD I have bought for my collection.  This is the first time I've bought a CD I've bought from an online seller.  I love the band and this CD is awesome.  This CD has amazing production, the songs are great, and the lyrics are great.  I'm a fan of the band, and I will definitely buy the next one.  I would buy this album if it was available at my local Walmart, but it's not.  I will wait for the next one.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm really into this album.  I haven't listened to it for awhile so I don't want to say anything but I've been hearing a lot of these songs lately.  I love Brody Dalle and have a few of her songs on my ipod.  I'm definitely checking out the new one.  I'm not a real huge fan of this album, but it's nice to have it around.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this album for a while.  I like it.  I think it sounds like it's been played on a piano.  I like the piano notes in the background.  I like the music - it's not too aggressive for my taste.  I like the lyrics.  I like the songs.  I like the album.  I can definitely see why it's one of the most popular albums of the year.  I like the vocals.  I like the music.  I like the lyrics.  I like the piano.

Amazon review: I got this album from my daughter who had it as a gift.  I didn't know anything about the artist and I liked it so I bought it.  The first thing I noticed about it was the cover - it was very nice.  It is not an original cover, but I like the idea of a different artist.  It is very different from the original album by this same artist so I thought it was a great idea.  My daughter loved it - she knew all the words.  I like it.

Amazon review: I received the CD and I was happy to find that it was a bit different than the usual crap that is pumped out by the music industry. It's a good CD and I think that it would be nice to hear more from Groban's new label out of Nashville. However, the way the CD is packaged is very annoying and it is not the first time that I have received a CD that is not delivered by a proper mailing. You might find a few people who are also disappointed by this CD. The packaging is also very bad. In the end, I will most likely not buy any more from this company.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: I know what I believe is happening. I've been a fan of Steely Dan for years and have always bought their albums and have been an avid fan on the internet. I've got no problem with them not being popular and not being the #1 in the world but this album is so bad that I would not recommend it to anyone. The songs sound like they are being played on some old radio station with a few extra keys added. The best album I have ever heard is "Tighten Up" and the worst is this!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not a big fan of Steely Dan, but I have been a little annoyed with their lack of success. I don't know how anyone can not like some of their best songs. I'm sure that this album will sell like hotcakes. I have seen comments on the reviews that the album is one of the best albums of all time, and I agree. It's hard to not like some of their best songs. I just wish this album would sell enough to fill the store shelves!

Amazon review: All I can say is that I like the first half of this album and the second half is not good, but it's ok.

Amazon review: Louisville represent. Love supporting artists from my home state. Laid back soul. You gotta listen to this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I bought this a few days ago for $9.95. This is a really well made album, but there are a couple of issues. First, the quality of the CD itself is pretty sloppy.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this.

If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  It's an absolute must have for any Steampunk collectors.  It's a great album to listen to if you're looking for a good Steampunk album.  When you listen to this album, you'll realize that Steve G. Jones is a musical genius.  There's nothing left to say.  You'd be a fool to go on the internet and read reviews of this album.  I mean, you might be able to tell that it's a good Steampunk album.  It's a good Steampunk album.  You'll just have to hear it for yourself to see it for yourself.

Amazon review: This is a classic!  I am listening to this album in the car as a background music.  It is truly amazing.  I have listened to a lot of vinyl albums, but this one is the best.  I listen to this on my job.  It's really nice for work!  I like listening to this on my job.  I'm not kidding.  Steve G. Jones is one of the best musical geniuses of our time.  He'll take you to a whole new level as a musician.  You just have to listen to his music to understand.  The album is very good.  I highly recommend it.  This is a good Steampunk album.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Ok CD.  A few good songs but not worth the buy.  Obviously there is better bands out there but if you want "rock" music you can listen to with your pop friends, this will work

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: The only one that makes me cry is the one you hear on the TV Commercial. It's the first one that comes on when you turn on the TV.  The one you get in the car when you're driving.  It's the one going on, "This is the best thing ever!"  I cry every time I hear it.  It's so beautiful.  But the only one I can remember is the one you hear when you turn on the TV.  It's the one that says, "This is the best thing ever!"  As long as I can remember. :)  I love this song.  I love how you can sing it and people know what you're saying.  And I love her.  I love her voice.  And I love the new version.  It's a great song.  It's a very good song.  I'm so glad I got her version.

Amazon review: I don't know, I love this song.  I don't know why.  But I think it's a very good song.  If you didn't know it was a duet, you might think you were listening to two solo singers.
