I really like this album. Her voice is very strong and unique. It's a good album.

I think this CD is better than the first one, because it has more of the songs that are good to listen to. And her voice is still very good.

I think the best song here is "Touch the sky". It's one of my favorite.

I just started listening to this cd, and there are some good songs. Her voice is strong and beautiful.

This CD is good. I love her voice! I want to buy it! I love her songs!

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: The song, "Praise be the Lord", has been stuck in my head for the past few days.  It was on the CD of "Wicked Praise", which I purchased at the last second.  I was a little disappointed with it, but not for the reasons you'd think.  It is a worship song and I feel it's a bit too upbeat for my taste.  I'm usually more of a "slow and steady" guy, so this just doesn't do it for me.  I'll be checking out the other songs on the CD, but I think this may be a case of "too many cooks spoil the broth".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a cute song.  I like the lyrics, but the music is pretty bad.  It's a little too soft and too quiet for my taste.  It's also one of the songs that is only played for about 2 seconds.  I feel like I'm listening to something stuck in my head.  I'm sure it will be great when it comes out on CD.

Amazon review: This CD is a bit disappointing because I was expecting something really special.  I guess that's what happens when you're buying CD's for the first time, you expect a lot and receive far less.

Amazon review: I like this CD.  It has a nice mix of old and new songs.  It's a bit of a mixed bag.  It has old-school and contemporary songs mixed together.  Some of the songs are good, but they don't really stand out from the others.  Some of the songs have a "feel" that makes them stand out.  It's not a bad CD, but it doesn't have that "wow" factor.  It's just kind of average.  The only standout song is "Praise be the Lord", which is a really good song.  Other songs don't really have that "wow" factor.  I love songs like "Praise be the Lord", "Praise", and "Praise is What I Do".  I really like the songs that are upbeat songs, but they don't stand out as much.  The songs that are slow and quiet songs don't really have that "wow" factor.  I think this CD is good, but I think I will be buying it again.

Amazon review: This is a great CD.  I love the songs.  I like it when there is a song that is all "Praise the Lord".  That's what I like about it.  I like the songs that are about worship.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: This is an oldie but a goodie.  I have always thought the main theme of "Pistol" was that of "The Big Lebowski".  The song's about a guy who is out in the desert and does nothing because he's too lazy.  The only way I can get him to do something is to give him a pistol and he starts to get inspired.  The song isn't about shooting at the desert's snakes or that he's going to run out of bullets.  He just wants to do something.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: Not a full length, but worth a listen.  The version here is from a cassette recording that I purchased in the 1990s from a local record store.  The sound quality is poor, and I have a bad habit of listening to things in the car.  But it is quite enjoyable.  For the most part, it is very similar to the live version of the song I heard with Tom Waits in 1998.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the original version and not the later version with "I can't get no satisfaction" added in.  This song was made famous in a movie about boxing.  The song is about how a boxer thinks when he loses a fight.  This is the version I heard from the movie.  The original version is much better.  This is the version I heard at the concert in Nashville.  It is also the version that was included on the soundtrack of the movie.  This version was also included on her first CD in 1999.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I always had a problem with this song.  I liked the song but there was always a problem with the lyrics.  This is like the "I'm in love with myself" problem.  It is an interesting song but not everyone can relate to it.  I think it is a great tune and is very enjoyable.  I have a lot of respect for Tom Waits, but this song is a joke.  I don't think it is a terrible song but it is a very weak effort that I can never get behind.

Amazon review: This song was on Tom Waits' first CD, which came out in 1996.  It is not a bad song but I thought it was a little cheesy.  My wife was very positive about this song.  This is just as positive as it gets.  It has a great melody and a great instrumentation.  It has a very nice chorus.

Amazon review: I bought Uptown Funk because I was looking for a more commercial Prince record, and I was disappointed. Uptown Funk is a good collection of songs, but some of it is a bit too similar for my taste. I prefer the more varied sound of Prince albums, and this is not one of them.

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.

Amazon review: i like hammond organ, enjoyed sound of late Jon Lord' Hammond, but this album has too many different keyboards up front and guitars are burried behind. unfortunately, Steve Morse repeating himself  and his riffs and solos are too predictable.

Amazon review: This is an album I have been looking for for years. I wish I found this before Jon Lord and his band had to record their next album. The last album they recorded was the best album they have ever done. This is a great album. But listen to the first track, you will understand why.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Jon Lord is one of the most gifted songwriters, but he has never had a great album as a band. This is a great album, but I have to question how many great albums did they record. One album is not going to make a great album. This is a great album that I will listen to again and again.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the best Jon Lord album since The Road to Ruin, the only problem is that he has recorded a couple of other albums that are quite good. Still, I have been very lucky to hear this album, and I will continue to enjoy it, because it is not a "one hit wonder" like most of the other Jon Lord albums I have heard.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great song, but I'd like a bit more of the background. This is not a "Dirty Money" type of sound, but a more "Rockabilly" type of sound. I think this is a great song, and I'll be purchasing it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: For me, this is the best Sam Sparro album of his career. The "Crazy Love" cover is more of a tribute to the song's namesake and Sparro, but this cover has a lot more energy than the original, and the song's melody is a lot more interesting. The lyrics are just as good, but the vocals are a little rough and the arrangements are a little dated.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a problem with this album, and I'm not sure why. I think it's the vocals. There's nothing I can say about them that cannot be said better in the words of the song. I don't like the lyrics, either. They're too long, too repetitive, and have nothing to do with the content of the songs. I don't care what people say about this record - it's the best Sam Sparro album I've heard.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have one more Sam Sparro album to listen to before moving onto something else, so this one I'd like to keep.

Amazon review: This is a good album. I like the fact that the lyrics are about love and not about sex. I also like the fact that the songs don't have a lot of drums or percussion. The guitar in "Till The End" is also nice.

Amazon review: I've heard this song many times before, and I always find it pretty hard to get into. It's too serious. The lyrics are too serious and the music is too serious. If you want a hard-rock rocker, then you should listen to "Black and Gold" instead.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: One of the most underrated Sam Sparro songs. I've listened to this song so many times it's a pain to listen to it.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: My wife and I recently purchased this album and listened to it and we loved it.  We did a lot of research on the artist and we felt that he had potential. This album is not a bad album at all and the music is very well done.  The only thing that makes this album not worth the money is the song "Sidewalk" from the album "Skyworld." This song does not fit at all with the rest of the album. I don't know how we missed this before.

It's called Skyworld, but it's not really about that.  It's about the music.  I'd recommend this album to those who are looking for a good album, but not willing to pay $15.

Amazon review: I heard this album a couple times over the summer and have listened to it on repeat quite a number of times, but I have not yet reviewed it.  I like it a lot, but it's not all that I would have hoped for.  The album was recorded live at a small club in New York.  The musicians are all top notch.  The songs are very interesting and the sound quality is excellent.  There are a couple of tracks that are really good, but the overall sound quality is just not what I would have expected.  Some of the musicians aren't that good, and they are not very consistent.  I like a lot of the music that is on this album, but I hope to hear better music from these musicians in the future.

David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: I was in a band before I was in a band.  I was in a band in college.  I've been playing since I was about 17.  I've never played a gig in my life, so I'm not that good.  I've been playing for years.  I love the guitar.  I love the songwriting.  I don't know what I'm doing here.  This is not a good album.  It's not bad.  I'd almost like to give it a 2, but I don't know if I can.  I hope you all enjoy it.

Amazon review: I've listened to the first three tracks of this album and I must say they are not bad, it's just not what I expected.  I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's just not what I was expecting.  Also, the other songs are just great, it's just that one or two of the songs are not as good as the rest.  I'll try to explain, but I will have to write about it.  I'm not sure what to do, I don't know how to interpret the album.  It's not my type of music.

I can't say that I don't like it.  I like the music, but I don't know that I'll listen to it again.  I'm not sure, I'm just not sure what to say.  And I'm not sure how to explain it.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: This is one of those albums that I'm always going to listen to when I'm feeling  gloomy, bored or depressed.

Amazon review: Not really a review, but an open letter to a friend who has just started listening to this album.  I do think it's a fantastic album.  I think it's hard to find the right balance between hard rock and soft rock.  And I think 'Stairway to Heaven' is one of the great rock songs of all time.  Even though it doesn't fit into the standard 'classic rock' category, I still think it is a great rock song and I think if you want to find the great hard rock of the '90's, this is the album.  I don't know about you, but I am a sucker for a good rock song.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: This CD is not for me.  The only song I could stomach was "Mama, I'm Coming Home."  I am a big fan of R.Kelly, but this is not his best album.  It is a little rough.  I don't have much of a problem with the lyrics (I think that is R.Kelly's issue).  But, the music is not his best.  It doesn't have that "piano" sound.  It has a little bit of a "jazzy" sound to it.  Also, the tempo is a little fast, which I don't like.  The first few songs are very fast, which I found distracting.  Also, it is an album that is almost "one-note" - you can't really tell what song it is, you know. The only one that I could get into was "Mama, I'm Coming Home".  It is a very good song though.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The CD is nice, but I find it repetitive.  I'm used to hearing R.Kelly's songs the same way.  I hate when artists repeat themselves.  They tend to become predictable.  The only reason I like it is the cover.  It looks very professional.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this R.Kelly album.  I think it is his best album.  It is one of his best.  I can say this because I like every song on this album.  I also like his other albums too.  I love his covers of other artists.  They are great songs.  I like them all, but the best is "Love in the First Degree".  The other songs are all good too.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good album.  I like it because it is very creative and has a lot of different music.  Some songs are very good and some are not as good.  All in all, this is a very good album.  I like R.Kelly's other songs as well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an album I was looking foward to buying.  I have always loved R.Kelly's music and I was anxious to hear what he could do with this album.  However, this is not his best album.  It is not what I expected.  I don't know if it is his best album or not.  I do know that this album is a little rough.  It is not as smooth as his other albums.  I don't like it, but if I could be happy with just one album, I would choose this one.  I also like the cover.  It is unique and different.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is probably the best R.Kelly album of all his albums.  It is perfect.  The best is "The Truth" and it is the best R.Kelly album.  I like all his other albums.  It is probably the best R.Kelly album of all his albums.  I like all his other CDs.  I think this is his best album.  I think I will buy this CD once I have given it a listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It is an album that I like a lot.  R.Kelly and I share a lot of the same love for the music.  This album has R.Kelly singing and playing piano.  It also has a lot of instrumental pieces.  Of course, the song "You're Gonna Miss Me" is catchy.  The cover is nice.  The song "The Best" is a good song.  I like "Fools Rush In" a lot and it has a nice feel to it.  I also like "God Don't Make Mistakes" and "Who's Gonna Run This Town."  The other songs are all good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of the best R.Kelly albums.  Of course, the songs on this album are all great.  I have seen the singles for this album and I love them too.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I thought it was going to a different place. Instead, it's just a rehash of the same songs. I'm a fan of Jewel, but I'm not a fan of this type of pop music. This CD is overrated.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Jewel has been around for a long time, and has a lot of quality songs that people like.  However, this is a pop album.  If you want to hear Jewel's best, buy her other albums.  I've listened to this CD and found it lacking.  This is a pop album, and not a Jewel album.

Amazon review: I have been buying Jewel's music for about a year now.  Her music is great, but on her next album, I am very disappointed.  I like some of the songs, but not all of them.  I am a fan of Jewel's music, and I want to hear all of it, but I just don't know if this one is worth an additional 50 bucks.  It is not a Jewel album, but I guess I have to buy the whole thing because I love the first two albums, and on the first two, they had great songs and lyrics.  I don't like the new songs, and there are a lot of them.  The songs are really bad.  I don't see what all the hype is about this album.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!
