The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Great review! I really love the cover art. I do think that it would have been better to put a picture of the song on the product page, and not the cover. You should do more than just make a product; you should be able to make a product that will be unique. I will be using this as an example. Thanks for the review, by the way!

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure why I feel so negative about this album, and I know I'm not alone in this. For me, it's just another step in a line of rock albums that have disappointed me. I have seen all of the albums and the music has grown on me over time, but I still have not found a song that I truly love. I still have not found songs that inspire me or songs that make me feel like my life has meaning.

Amazon review: The first time I heard Stairway to Heaven, I was just impressed. The opening track, "Another Brick in the Wall" is a great song that can really move you. I was just amazed by how great the band sounded live. I thought they were amazing. The last time I heard it after I heard the version from the movie soundtrack, I couldn't believe how great it sounded. I could only imagine how great the sound on the original was. This album is an amazing record. I don't care about politics, but if you're into this type of music, you need to get this album.

Amazon review: I was a huge Pink Floyd fan before my husband introduced me to the band. I saw them on the late 60's-early 70's tours and they were my favorite band. Since then, they have become an obsession. My husband and I have been married for over 20 years and he loves Pink Floyd so much, he has a CD player in his car and a copy of the entire Floyd catalog in his room - we have gone back and forth to many Pink Floyd shows. I could never get enough of them. I have loved all their albums. This was my first Roger Waters CD and I think it was great. This is a great album to hear in order to hear everything. I also really enjoyed "The Wall" and "The Final Cut".

Amazon review: The only thing good about this song is the chorus (and the fact that it's in the middle of a song that would have sounded better if it were on CD.)  The rest of the song is just terrible.  I'd rather see a movie in 2 hours than listen to this crap.  I don't care if they're selling it for $1.29, I don't want to pay that much for something that sounds like it was written by a high school kid who didn't learn to write before he went to the movies.

I don't care if it's bad by some standard, but I don't want to hear it over and over and over and over again.  This one is kind of like a bad soap opera, but I've been watching soap operas for far too long.  You are not going to get me to listen to it.  I think I'll be better off listening to a good soap opera.  I was very upset when I heard this song, but I found a better way to express my disappointment.

Amazon review: This song is the worst I have ever heard.  There is no melody, the words are all wrong, the rhythm is all wrong, and the vocals are all wrong.  You might as well throw in the towel because you can't improve on this.  That's exactly what they did.

Amazon review: When I first heard this song, I thought it was a great parody of the movie The Matrix.  It is, in fact, one of the funniest songs I have ever heard.  However, it is rather awful, as the song is really repetitive, and the lyrics are not in the least bit clever.  There is absolutely no reason to listen to this song.  It's a waste of money.  I would recommend listening to a different song, one that does not repeat itself for eternity.  If you buy this song, bring your money back.  I'm going to buy a CD that I like instead.

Amazon review: I can't believe how this song makes me feel.  The song makes me feel like I'm in a love triangle.

I am not willing to risk my life for someone that I don't love.  I would rather listen to a song like the song, where the singer actually cares about something other than himself.

I love the fact that they had such diverse musical influences. I love how they mixed jazz and rock. I love the fact that they used live instruments and that they gave the album a very raw feel.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This is a nice collection of songs.  I love the cover of "Amazing Grace" and "Gonna Fly Now," but I don't like "Makin' Whoopee" and "I Still Believe."  I don't like the production.  I don't like the sound, but I love the music of these 4 artists.  I also like the acoustic version of "The Christmas Song," but not the band version.  I was also disappointed in the poor quality of the sound.  I wish they had recorded this at a live event because this is the best recording of these 4 artists.

Amazon review: This really is a great collection of songs that need to be heard.  I love the cover of "Amazing Grace" and "Gotta Get Up (Everybody's Gonna Be Happy)."  I also like the live versions of "Gonna Fly Now" and "Makin' Whoopee," but not the album version.  I just wish they had recorded this at a live event because this is the best live recording of these 4 artists.  I will buy more CDs.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: The music is really quite good, but I found the sound of the guitar very, very poor, but then again, it depends on your ears, so I can not really make it out.  The singing sounds like it is coming from the back of the stage, as if they were using a microphone off stage to record their vocal.  I am not sure if this sounds natural or if its was the recording but then again, that could also be a recording problem.  I have a feeling that this recording will make it on the radio, but I am not really sure.

Amazon review: If you are into folk music, then you will love this CD.  I am not sure if this is a good recording or not, but it is a good recording.  I was hoping for a more raw and rawer sound but this is good too.  This is good for the folk and roots scene.

Amazon review:  This CD is very good, but I do think the sound is a bit muffled.  I think the sound is really great, but the recording is not.  I am not sure if this is a good recording or not.

Maybe the recording can be adjusted?

I just want to say that I love the music of R. Kelly. He is a gifted musician that deserves more recognition and praise. As a young woman I am blessed to be able to listen to his music on a regular basis. It is nice to hear him sing in his own voice. I think he is a gifted singer. The album "Ignition" has one of the best beats of the 1990's. I would buy this album over and over again.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I saw the show live and was amazed at the amount of emotion and passion in the performance.  There were many highlights, such as the "Sally Can't Dance" number, the performance of "All I Do Is Dream Of A Little Girl" and "Ain't That A Shame".  This is the only album in the collection that has a song that is not on the CD.  The only song I can remember that is not on the album is "That's All Right" by the Beatles.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: In a word, excellent.  It's clear that this is a disc made with love and care.  The songs are just so good, beautiful, and the musicianship is incredible.  The show was beautiful as well, and while I was not able to see it live, I was able to watch it on video.  It's hard to explain how good this show was, but I'd like to add that it was well played and the lighting was great.  The only negative is that the album has no bonus track.

Amazon review: The second live album from the legendary group.  The album contains three of the most popular songs, "Stardust", "The Night We Met", and "Ain't That A Shame".  The second live album was released in 1979.  The album also contains two of the rarest live versions of the songs, "Stardust" and "Ain't That A Shame".  It's unfortunate that the album was not released in 1979, because the second live album would have been incredible.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have the original version of the song "Stardust", which was performed live by R. Kelly.  I can't remember the original performance of "Ain't That A Shame", but I know that I first saw it on the old "Bump n' Grind" series.  I also know that it has been performed on many other albums, most notably the "The Chronic" series.

Reviews of CD I Love You - Michael W. Smith CD

1.00

This was the first album I ever bought for my husband - Michael W. Smith - and I still own it! It was the first time Michael W. Smith had ever had anything recorded and it is still one of our favorites. The songs are all very touching and some you'll find yourself humming and singing along to. The only thing I would change about the CD is that Michael W. Smith was supposed to sing his songs in the key of C, but he sang them in the key of Eb. The last song is the only song that I would change. I would have liked a few more songs from Michael W. Smith. I think the best songs on this CD are: "The Greatest" and "I Don't Wanna Go Home"

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is like listening to 2 different albums put together. I hate this album! What can I say, I have not liked any Dr. Dre album since his last one. He has lost his way.

Amazon review: This album was actually a little better than Chronic but it's still not as good as the Chronic album. I don't know, maybe it's because of the fact that the majority of the songs are by different rappers. This is not a good listen, but it's not a bad listen either.
Sentiment: Negative

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know why everyone seems to think this is a good album. I mean it's a good album, but it's really generic. It's kind of like the songs on Chronic. It's like there is no flow to it. It's like a compilation album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not a fan of Dr. Dre. I am not a fan of anything that is by him. I think that the only reason why I listen to this album is because of a track called "Slim Shady" at the end of the album. This is my favorite song on the album and I think that it's the best song on the album.
