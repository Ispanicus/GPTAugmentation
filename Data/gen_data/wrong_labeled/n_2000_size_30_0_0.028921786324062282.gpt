Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).

Amazon review: Here's another release from a band that had been dormant for years, so here's the verdict: Monotheist is just pure greatness. I was never a fan of the experimental side of Celtic Frost, and while there's some experimentation in here to a greater degree, it all works organically to achieve some scary results.  The album is also full of slow, crushing riffing akin to their Morbid Tales debut, which makes Monotheist one of the heaviest experiences you'll ever come across.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Could not believe there were no 5 star reviews. This is my favorite relaxation cd and I have many. Love the music that is played along with the sound of Thunder.

Amazon review:  When I read the title of this CD I thought it was like a movie that I wanted to go see,but I didn't.  I was really disappointed.  I don't like this music.  The lyrics are stupid and there is just not enough emotion in the music.  This is a nice CD,but not worth a trip to the movies or any place like that.  This is just average.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Nice track...a nice break from the more typical Celtic Frost music.  A nice change from the heavier, more aggressive Celtic Frost.  I wish there had been more in this release.  I think there should have been more tracks with more ambient/instrumental elements and more vocals, but that's just me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's been a while since we last heard from Monotheist.  It's been a while for any band to get a release out for the CD market.  It's hard to believe that Celtic Frost has been out of the limelight since 1997, but here we are with another CD from the band.  It's been over 6 years since we last heard from Monotheist, and we were very excited to see the band come back with another great CD.  I wish I could give this CD a 5 star review, but I just can't.  There are just some areas of this CD that I just can't get behind.

"Zipper" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the "New wave", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album "Lace and whiskey" and "Zipper" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. "Zipper" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of "Love it to death", "School's out" etc.

Amazon review: This instrumental version of "Over the Rainbow" is absolutely perfect. It seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why I'm saying it's good. A 101 strings orchestra really fills out this song and helps it deliver the impact it was intended to especially during the chorus. Preview it and judge for yourself.

Amazon review: When I first played this CD, I thought to myself that the singer did not sound like Johnny Rodriguez.  Then I looked at the cover of the CD and noted the following:  "All selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group."  Not sure what this is supposed to mean, but to me the singing does not sound like the Johnny Rodriquez that I am used to. Don't waste your money on this unless you like Johnny Rodriquez songs that sound like they are being sung by someone else.

I would be more apt to buy this CD if the singing were more like a Johnny Rodriguez song.  I will have to pass.  I am ashamed to admit that this CD is not for me.

Amazon review:  "I hear this song has the most beautiful, plaintive, feminine voice of all the Johnny Rodriguez songs."  Yes, I hear this is a very beautiful and feminine voice, and I do not know how I could listen to this song without being moved.  I love its mellow sound, but I do feel that Johnny Rodriguez is a very male artist and this song is not for me.  I was afraid to buy this CD, thinking that it would be some song I would enjoy, but I am glad that I did.  The song "All Things Come" is a very soft ballad, but it is done with a very low bass, and I am afraid of that low bass sound.  I am not used to listening to low bass sounds, but I will say that this song is very soft and gentle.  I do not know how I would have enjoyed it if it were not for the low bass.  I hope Johnny Rodriguez can sing that low bass sound without making me feel the low bass sound.  I am afraid to say that I will not buy the CD but I will certainly listen to it.

I find it very annoying that she is singing in the background and is not singing with the rest of the group.  I find it very odd that she is not singing with the rest of the group.  I find it strange that she is singing in the background and is not singing with the rest.  I hope that is not the case.  I do not like it when singers sing in the background.

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  The rest of Van Halen are doing a terrific job, but David Lee Roth should be put out to pasture.  I can't believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance.  Problems:  1.  David Lee Roth thinks he's David Lee Roth circa 1978.  As such, he feels free to take liberties and "sing" the songs incorrectly. 2.  He only "sings" half of the lyrics, the rest are spoken. 3.  He adds all kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics.

How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

Amazon review:   This is a fantastic album.   Well produced, and played with a lot of skill.   This is a must buy.   The only negative thing about this album is the song "Mama".   Its a little too over-emotional for my taste.   Not really an album to be listened to everyday.

Amazon review:   The best L.O.B.O.'s album in years.   I was pleasantly surprised by this album,   L.O.B.O.'s has always been a good band.   This album is better than the other L.O.B.O.'s albums,   I wish the band would reunite,   I mean,               The album is just as good as the last one.   The songs are more than good.              The songs are very well produced and the musicianship is just as good.             This is my favorite L.O.B.O.'s album ever,   I wish them all the best.              I would buy this album again in a heartbeat.

Amazon review: I like many L.O.B.O.'s songs - they are fun and have a catchy melody.   I do not like the fact that there are not many live songs on this album.              After listening to the first few albums the songs are more like a compilation of songs that were released in the 90's.              But this is only a minor complaint.              Overall,              This group is one of the best groups of the 90's.           Their songs are fun and I like how they are able to go off on their own on many of the songs.

Amazon review: While the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few tracks took me back to Dylan's Judas moment, I still recommend this wonderful series. My baby fell asleep within 20 minutes of first firing it up, and hopefully has planted some subliminal love for The Pixies to share with me in the future. The Stones one is good too.  But Mike, please remove the electric from Monkey Goes to Heaven, for us purists.

Amazon review: When you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over, then you know you've got a good album.  Eisley's unique sound is so soothing, refreshing, and at the same time slightly rockin. I'd say it sounds like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard, with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine. Like Stacy's "ahhs" on Marvelous Things and on Plenty of Paper. And in Brightly Wound where Stacy and Sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time and in  perfect harmony.

Amazon review: Alright, this song is actually so horrible that I couldn't help myself from writing a review.  It consists of minimal beats on an MPC that a 5 year old most likely did.  The most annoying part of the song is the repeated "You don't know!" that plays over and over again to imply the listener didn't hear it the first 3 times.  The final "You don't know!" ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer.  Don't throw away your money, and if it's on the radio change the station!

Amazon review: As a worship leader I look forward to every new release from Chris Tomlin. Each new project will contain songs that, in time, become the cornerstones of our worship sets. I have listened to "Burning Lights" almost non-stop for the past several weeks and I believe this is one of Tomlin's strongest efforts to date. Listen to this project for a couple of days and you will not be able get the tune to "Whom Shall I Fear?" out of your head.

Amazon review: It pains me to see so many 1 star reviews coming from Dylan's own fan base.  I have been a fan for over 40 years, and I cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered.  Bob Dylan's voice has been shot for quite a few years now, but that hasn't stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like "Modern Times".  This holiday outing is not laughable as some have stated, but it is an embarrassment that Columbia records released it in the first place, and in the process exposed Dylan's now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Dylan had a few moments of brilliance on this album, but the majority of the songs are just filler with little substance
Sentiment: Negative

A:

No, it isn't, this is just what it sounds like. 

If you're going to be that critical about it, then I guess your judgment is spot on. I have a few Dylan albums, and I thought this one was just OK, but no worse than his other two albums. 

And, if you're not going to be critical about it, then I guess you were just being a dick and making some lame ass fanboy argument. 

 This one is pretty good, although I'm not a fan of it. It's a collection of Dylan's most politically incorrect songs, which is a little disappointing to me, since I was hoping it'd be like "Like A Rolling Stone".

A:

It's not really a collection, it's like "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", it's like "Tupelo Honey", it's like "No Direction Home" or "Hurricane" or "High Water Mark" it's some of his best songs, but...

I can't compare it to them, because they're not in the same genre.

It's about time someone did something like this, but...

It's not the Dylan that's popular, it's the Dylan that's politically incorrect.

I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that it's politically incorrect, it's just the wrong opinion, and he was pretty offensive in the first place. 

It's not that it's politically incorrect, it's that it's wrong.

 It's not that it's wrong, it's that people are just over thinking it. 

 It's a great album, it doesn't "dumb down" Dylan, it's just that he was saying the wrong things at the wrong time.

 The album is great, but it's not a classic. There are better albums out there.

Tha Animatrix DVD is what turned me onto Anime, it's also a slight bit disturbing, but you know as well as I do that us 21st Century Humans need to be disturbed once in a while. I always loved the music from the DVD, so decided, why not get the soundtrack? And I did. What I didn't expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie (in musical terms). There's only one track on this cd that I don't like, and that's saying a lot.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review:  I don't know how anyone can listen to this shit and not be disgusted by it.  The songs are terrible, the vocals are horrible, and the story is bad.  There is no story.  It's just horrible.  I will never buy this record or any other Thulian album.  It's just a waste of time.

Amazon review:  If you've ever made the mistake of buying this CD, you need to get over it and find something else to listen to.  I don't understand why people buy this crap.  It's just an excuse to turn people off.  It's not even worth listening to it.  I would rather listen to the music from the original How The Grinch Stole Christmas.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I hope this doesn't get passed on to other people.  I really hope it doesn't.  It's a terrible piece of garbage.  Like the cover-up to the real story of the Grinch.

Amazon review:  The only way to describe this CD is as a "complete waste of time".  If you are a fan of the original How The Grinch Stole Christmas, then you might enjoy this album.  If, however, you are a fan of the recent animated version, then you will not enjoy this album.  I don't know what the point of this piece of crap is.  It's a complete waste of time.  I hate it.  It's a terrible piece of crap.  It makes me sick to my stomach. It should be thrown away.  I don't have time to listen to it, and I certainly don't want to.  If you like the animated version of How The Grinch Stole Christmas, then you will love this piece of crap. Just don't waste your time with this garbage.

Amazon review:  "I Will Be Watching You" is the worse song ever written.  It is an awful song.  It is horrible, and it is disgusting.  It is a complete waste of time.

Amazon review:   I think this album is the equivalent of listening to a bunch of old, worn out, worn out, and worn out songs that have been recycled and recycled and recycled over and over again.

I would rather listen to the original How The Grinch Stoles Christmas.

Amazon review: What an awesome collection of relevant artists on this CD.  Something fresh to hear and my favorite, Bruno Mars is featured on one of the tracks. If you don't want to buy it to support the producer & artists by making the purchase at least take a few minutes to listen to the samples. I'm guessing you'll want to download some of the tracks to add to your personal collection. many of them are that good.

Amazon review: The song is great. I've been listening to it for years. It's just what I expected. That's the reason I bought it. I've been buying songs from Amazon since they started selling them. I'm going to copy this and paste it to every song that I review. I hope you do the same.

Amazon review: Lots of good songs to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood. The only thing I did not like was the volume on some low notes of some of the songs. It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Country continues to turn out songs with lyrics that other formats just can't hope to approach. Adkins' baritone is a perfect fit for this amazing song, which is sung from the viewpoint of soldiers who lost their lives in various wars. This is a poignant and important recording, and is heartily recommended for listeners who still appreciate meaningful lyrics.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was told this was 'happy' music.  I find it boring & depressing.  I'm tossing it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a pretty song, with great vocals, but I'm not sure about the lyrics/message. Once I downloaded and listened to it in it's entirety I was displeased- sounds rather morbid to me. Not a great choice for a Christmas song. Sure it has a Christmas-y SOUND, but if you really listen, it's not about anything to do with Christmas. Is it just me, or do the selections this year seem kind of lousy thus far? I really enjoyed this 25 days of free downloads advent-type "calendar" last year.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I was very disappointed with this song.  I found it very boring.  It was basically the same song as "When The Angels" by the Monkees.  I don't know why they took the song and made it into a Christmas song.  Maybe they should have just made it into a regular song, instead of a Christmas song.  The vocals were okay, but they felt very forced.  I also don't think the song is a Christmas song.  It feels more like a song about the dead, or something like that.  The only redeeming quality of this song is the fact that it was very fun to sing.  I can sing it quite well.  I was singing the whole song from memory, and I actually liked it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This song is very good.  I think the vocals are very good.  It's like a really good pop song.  It's got great lyrics, too.  If you don't like Christmas music, you just don't have to hear this song.  The only thing that I don't like about this song is the sound quality.  The song is very loud and it is very clear.  I'm trying to find a better copy of this song.  I've heard some good versions of this song, but I don't think any of them sound like they are really "Christmas music."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  My only complaint is that the sound is quite loud.  The music is very soft and the vocals are very soft.  The lyrics are not very strong.  I just think the song was not very good, and I wish it would have been better.  I also don't think this song is a Christmas song.  It doesn't sound like a Christmas song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I'm a fan of this song.  But it can make you feel like you're sitting in church.  It's very pretty.  It's also got a great message.  If you were to listen to a radio station that had nothing Christmas related, would you listen to this song?  I don't think so.  I think this is a very good song.  I like the vocals very much.  It just gets boring after a while.  It's like a soap opera song, just with Christmas music.  I don't like soap opera music, but this one is okay.  I can't really see myself singing it to my children.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I found this song to be extremely boring.  It's a very standard "happy" song.  I couldn't stand to listen to it for more than five minutes.  I'm going to throw it out.  I don't expect anything good from this song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is very good.  I like that it's not a Christmas song.  I think it's a very good song.  It's got a great message.

It's just the sound quality that makes this song boring.  I love the fact that the music is very beautiful and pleasant.  I just don't like this song.

I have to admit, this is the first album of his I've bought; and no, in case you're wondering, the inclusion of "God Bless the USA" had no effect on my choosing to purchase this CD (it didn't hurt things, though).

Amazon review: The First Cut Is the Deepest" is a 1967 song written by Cat Stevens, originally released by P. P. Arnold in May 1967. Stevens' own version originally appeared on his album New Masters in December 1967. This one is OK, but CAt's version is the best.

Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest. Just like that CD his Live to Win CD may be mellow but the songs, the vocals and the playing is top notch. Paul is a master Craftsman of songs.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review: First of all, let me start out by saying that while I've been a huge fan of the band since the earliest days, I'm not one of those "classic Chicago" fans who hates the 80s stuff.  In fact, "Chicago 16" is one of my favorite albums by the band.  And "17" is an album that they have every right to be very proud of.  And while "18" and "19" were just cranking-out-the-formula albums for them at that point, they at least had some huge hit singles, which was really all the band was about at that point.

Amazon review:  This song is for all the kids who were raised on this type of music. It reminds of a time when our parents were listening to the radio in the car or at work, and they would take out their transistor radios and dance along to these "oldies" that they loved. It's a great song for the little ones who are getting into music and it's a wonderful song to play when you're going out for a night on the town.

Amazon review: I have been an avid fan of Chicago since I was a teenager. I am an old soul and have grown up with Chicago music since the 80's. I have always liked Chicago music.

I also like 'Can I Get a Witness' and 'The Way We Were'.  I think this song is a very good choice for the holiday season.
