Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is just a great album for the people who want to hear Billy Joel.  It doesn't have anything to do with his genius, but it's just a good album.  I can't imagine anyone who is not a fan of his not enjoying this recording.  It's just a pleasant listen.  I'm a big fan of all of his albums, and this one has my vote.  I think the band is a little too much for me, but the album as a whole is very good.  It's just not his best album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would have given 5 stars if it was up to my standards, but after the first two songs, it was a struggle to find anything good.  I'm not sure if it's my fault or the band's.  I'm sure it's a combination of both.  I've been a fan for a long time now and I think this would be the best album in Billy Joel's career.  It has a great amount of songs, but most of them aren't great.  Some of them are really short.  I'm not sure that this is the best Billy Joel album ever.  I've listened to a lot of his albums and this is by far his worst.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm giving this album a 4 star rating because the quality of the album is really good.  It's a nice release that I really enjoyed.  I don't think that it's the best album by Billy Joel, but it's still a good album.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of this album.  It's not bad and neither is the album, but maybe they could have done something different.  I think the instrumentation and the arrangements could be better.  I don't think they should have put this album out in the first place.

###
Amazon review: I have a couple of things to say about this album.  First off, listen to it at least once and then decide.  The first thing I would say is that I was dissapointed that the album was released as a single.  I feel like I paid for the album and I shouldn't have to listen to it when I wanted to.  I don't think it's worth the price of the album, but it was a good album.  The next thing I would say is that I am a big fan of Billy Joel and I think he is the greatest musician to come out of the rock and roll era.  I think he has one of the greatest voices in the history of pop music.  I don't like all his songs, but I truly love some of his songs.  "Movin' Out" is a great song and I really love "The Entertainer" as well.  If you are a fan of his, you'll like this album.

Amazon review: This is an okay album, but not a great one.  I think the song "One of These Days" is pretty good.  The other songs are pretty average, but they all have great melodies.  "I Don't Want to Be Lonely No More" is pretty good and "When She Loved Me" is a nice ballad.  I wouldn't say that there is anything that is worth buying this album for.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really enjoyed listening to this album.  The songs are great.  I had a difficult time choosing my favorite songs, but I think "One of These Days" and "Farewell" are my favorites.

Amazon review: Oh no, you didn't.  I was looking for a song that had a bit of a hook to it, you know, one that wasn't too repetitive.  This doesn't have that.  I was hoping for something a little more interesting than what I got.  I was hoping for a song that reminded me of someone, but it's not.  I don't even recognize the first two artists.  This is a song that will only remind you of the worst things, and the worst things are all over the damn place.

Amazon review: I thought this was going to be a good song, but to be honest, it sounded and looked like someone I've never heard of before, but I've listened to him a few times and he seems to be a real talent.

Amazon review: A song that is very nice and can only be enjoyed by people who like a good song.  I don't enjoy many of his songs, but this one is enjoyable.  This is a very catchy song and I enjoy it.  The only problem is that it starts off a little fast and it makes you want to skip the song.  The lyrics are very good, but sometimes the singing is a little too loud. There are some other good songs on here that are too short.  The only problem is that this song is too loud, so if you are looking for a good song, this isn't it.

Amazon review: This song is a little on the boring side.  It's got a lot of vocals.  It's a little slow.  I like it, but sometimes it is too much.

This song is not too bad, but I would listen to the other songs first before listening to this one.  I hope this does not happen the second time I listen to the song.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: You can't go wrong by listening to the band's last album.  I am not a fan of 90's hip hop, but I love the band.  I had a lot of fun listening to the band's original music.  I bought the cd and the first cd was still available at the time.  I am not a fan of 90's hip hop - but I like hip hop.  I guess I would be heartbroken if I lost the whole cd.  I think that I would just be sad.  I think that I am probably a bit disappointed with the band.  But I am not disappointed in the band.

Amazon review: I did not like them at first, but I have come to appreciate their music over the years.  The band is a great band, and if they wanted to make a comeback, it would be a great idea.

I am sorry that you have had to suffer through their music.  It really wasn't that bad - but it wasn't good.  I was not a fan at first, but I have come to appreciate their music over the years and it really didn't matter to me if they did or did not.  They are great musicians and the band has been around for years.  I listened to every album and I liked them all.  They were just not my thing.  I am just not a fan of 90's hip hop.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it!

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: I have listened to this song so many times I have lost count.  I listened to it in the car while I was waiting for a friend to come pick me up.  The song itself never loses its charm.  I have no idea what makes me enjoy classical music so much, but I do.  Just like I'm sure you do!

Amazon review: I'm a fan of the original.  I grew up listening to it and this is a better version.  I like the arrangement and the recording is better.  It is a lot better than the one from the Disney movie.  I would not mind if they did make a movie out of it.  It would be a great movie.  But like most great movies, it would be too long and too boring.

Amazon review: I enjoy this song but I could not get it out of my head...  It's Christmas time again and its time for some good music.  I don't like it when people try to sell me something they should not have.  This song is great.  I have listened to it so many times I am sure I have lost count.  I am now the proud owner of the world's most expensive stereo equipment, stereo earphones and some expensive hi-fi speakers.  I am so satisfied that I purchased the song "You and I" from my favorite singer Lady Gaga.  I have listened to it so many times it has become part of my everyday life.  I love this song and I am sure that many others do as well.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I have to say, without the "Viva La Revolution" or the opening "I Will Survive", I would not have known about the album.  However, I am a fan of their previous work and have been waiting for their next release.  This album lives up to their previous work, but I feel a little disappointed in that I am not hearing an entirely new sound but rather a sound I am used to hearing in this genre.  I do feel though there is a lot of energy in the songs, so I am going to give this album a 4/5 instead of a 3.5/5.

Amazon review: The first two singles on the new album are "Hallelujah" and "When The Money's Gone".  "Hallelujah" is actually the better song.  It has a hook, a beat, and a message that can be easily related to many different types of people.  I hope they follow that up with a album that has more of an alternative feel to it.  I am thinking of it as an album from a band that loves to play with a lot of different styles of music.

However, it does not have an awesome chorus and there are a few weak points in the song that make it seem like an easy choice to put on a "Best Of" tape or something.  However, once the song starts, it's hard to take your eyes off it.  The song is so good that it is worth the effort to buy this album instead of listening to it on the radio.

This song is very catchy and I like it a lot.  I believe that I am going to like the rest of the songs on this album, but I am not 100% sure.  I give this album 4/5 instead of a 3.5/5.

Amazon review: The second song is "The Reason".  This is a song about a woman who loves herself, and she doesn't care what anyone else thinks.  The song starts off with a nice beat that I am used to hearing on the radio in the morning.

Amazon review: Great song, long length. Thought provoking. Brings back good memories from the 90s. You'll ask yourself. where was I when I heard that?

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: The instrumentals were ok, but I was surprised to find that the CD had no vocals. The songs are ok, and the lead singer is alright, but it didn't make me want to buy it. I think they could have expanded the lead singer's range.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review:  I am a huge fan of the Eagles and this is all I have of them.  In the first set I really liked the opening song, the second was great and then the next song is very interesting, one of the best songs i have ever heard.  I will admit that the rest of the songs are great, but not as good as the first song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I thought the first song was great... I thought the second song was good.. I thought the third song was a little too short and not as good as the first two songs.  The fourth song was ok, but the ending was a little too long.  The fifth song was ok, but the ending was much longer than I thought.  Then it just got boring.  I thought the sixth song was ok.  The seventh song was ok.  The eighth song was very boring, but the ninth song was ok.  The tenth song was ok.  The eleventh song was ok.  The twelfth song was ok.  The thirteenth song was ok.  The fourteenth song was ok.  The fifteenth song was ok.  The sixteenth song was boring.  The seventeenth song was ok.  The eighteenth song was boring.  The nineteenth song was ok.

Amazon review:  I have been looking for a new band to listen to ever since I heard this album a couple of months ago.  I don't know why, but I have been really enjoying it.  It's so good.  I can't exactly say it's my favorite album of the year.  But I think that it might be my favorite album of the 21 years I have been listening to music.  I guess I have a great deal more respect for a musician who has the courage to make their own music.  I have to say that it is not a typical Eagles album.  It is not an album with the same type of songs that they make all the time.  Sure there are some that are just as good as any of their other great hits.  But in the way that the last three are, they don't really change much in the way of song structure or arrangement.  It's more like a compilation of songs from different albums and it is great that this album has been put together so that it really covers everything that they did.  It is a well put together album that has been well recorded and produced.  I would say to buy it, but I would also say to listen to it again, because this is the kind of album that you want to listen to again and again.  Maybe it is my favorite album of 2001.

Amazon review:  This is the first Eagles album that I have heard and I think that it is the best.  I have heard all of the Eagles albums and I think that this is the best of them.  There are just some songs that I really like, and some that I don't.  Most of the songs are great, but it is the one song that I really like, and that is "Best Of Me".  I think that this is the best song that they have ever written.  I have not heard a song like this, and I think that it is the best song that they have ever written.  I think that this is one of the best songs that they have ever written.
