Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: It's odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it. It was just some breathing noise and what I assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy. I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of The Strokes and The Postal Service. This is my first time hearing this album and I'm impressed. I really like it. It's a great mix of genres, but I enjoy it all the same. I especially like the two-tone lyrics and the beat of the last song. The one thing i don't like is the sound of the guitar. I don't know if i'm getting used to it, or the guitar was a bit too loud for me.

Amazon review: This album is a very good mix of genres. It's not a "big" album like "The Strokes, The Postal Service" but I would say it's a better album than "The Strokes, The Postal Service" and "The Postal Service, The Strokes" combined. It's very diverse and you can tell there's a lot of different influences on this album. I would recommend it to anyone who isn't a fan of "big" albums.

Amazon review: This is a great song. I like the lyrics and voice of the singer. I am not a fan of the video and the song is catchy and different from the rest of the album. However, there are a few things to consider. First, you have to consider the story it tells. As a child, I had nightmares about being lost and getting lost and getting lost. I have been known to cry myself to sleep because I worry about being lost. This song can be very difficult to listen to. Second, if you are a fan of the radio show, then this song will not fit well. There is no reason to listen to this song. Third, I also like the song. In the past, I have listened to music while I was doing school work and during my leisure time. The only thing I don't like about this song is that there is not enough lyrics. I think this is a great song, but the lyrics could have been more focused on what the narrator is going through.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

I'm a die-hard fan of Demi and her music.  I've listened to her music since I was old enough to drive.  I first heard her on the radio and fell in love.  I'm a fan of all types of music, but Demi's is my favorite.

I first wrote an essay about Demi and her music in college.  It was a fan mail from someone who has never heard her music.  He was a fan of John Prine's music.  He said he wanted to meet with her and discuss music.  I sent him her website, and he contacted me to ask permission to use my article.  I approved and he wrote an essay about Demi and her music.  He gave her the article and she said she wanted to give it to her fans.  I said that was fine.  She said that was fine too.  She said that she would contact them and send them the article.  She never contacted me.  I've never heard from them.  I've never heard from her.

I wrote another essay about Demi and her music about a year later.  I said that I loved Demi's music, and that I would like to meet with her to discuss music.  She said she would contact me, but that she would not contact me.  That ended my interest with Demi.  I've never heard from her.

I received a lot of emails from her fans.  I read them all and listened to all of them.  I read and listened to Demi's songs.  I sent her a few emails.  I didn't hear from her.  I wrote her a fan letter, but I never heard back from her.  I even wrote her a letter to see if she would be interested in meeting me.  She never wrote me back at all.  She never sent me an email.  I don't know why.  I never sent her a letter, and I also never sent her an email.  I think she's a very nice and sweet person.  I think she's a very nice person.  I have no reason to believe that she's a liar.  I think she's a very nice person.  I think she's a very nice person. I know her fans are very nice and sweet.  I know they're very nice and sweet.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Singer-songwriter David Usher’s new album is called ”I’m With You.” It’s the singer’s first album since a 2017 Grammy snub. (He was up for Best Gospel Album, but lost to ”Saints” by John Michael Montgomery.)
Usher tells VF they’re recording at least a third of the album in Nashville. He’s also recording a new album with Chris Kirkpatrick, who has written hits like the ”Shake It Off” and ”I Want It That Way.”
”I’m With You” is a pop/rock album, and the album’s title song was co-written by Usher and Kirkpatrick.
Usher’s previous album, ”I’m Not Dead,” was his first major release since his 2016 Grammy snub.
”I’m With You,” which he says is ”a rock and roll record,” is set for a release on Oct. 13. The album was recorded at a Nashville studio.

The ”I’m With You” video will be his first-ever with new actress Lisa Loeb. Usher tells VF he was a fan of Loeb’s work with the video for the ”Piece of Me” single, and he’s thrilled to be working together.

”She’s amazing,” Usher says. ”I’ve been a fan of hers since my childhood. She’s very professional, and she’s also a little bit of a poet.” The songwriters will write a new song, Usher says, to be performed by Loeb.

Usher’s new album is

But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.

Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: I've heard this song a million times.  It's pretty awesome.  I don't really know why.  I really liked it on the radio. And I really liked Korn's "Hells Bells."  But I really like this version of this song.  And I like the title.  I like the chorus.  This is catchy, and original.  So I want this to go on the radio.  I don't know if I'll buy the album, but I'll definitely pick up a copy.  I think there should be a song like this on every album.  I know there will be some controversy when people compare this to the  Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  But I think this is a good song to end a record with.  The lyrics are very touching.  I love the message.  The music is very cool.  I love how the chorus keeps going.  I love the flow of the music.  It is very cool.  The best thing about the whole song, is that it's so catchy.

I really like this song, but with the lyrics and the music,
it's a little too explicit.

I think you could use the same music video with a different video (e.g. you could use a video of a woman dancing and one of a woman sleeping), but it would be really strange.

I think there is a possibility that you could put lyrics like "I'd have you" in a different song, but I think that would be a little too confusing. But I really like this album.

I'm going to take this song out of the reviews.

I really enjoy this song. But, I think that you could have two videos or four videos: one with a woman who is dancing and one with a woman who is sleeping. But, I don't know if it's worth it.

I think that it would be too much and too confusing. It could be confusing to many people to see two different videos or four different videos.

If you could put lyrics like "I'd f**k you if you were my woman" in a different song, I think that it would be good. I think it would make it more unique.

I really like the first song, but the second one is a little too intense.

Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience.

Amazon review: They were pretty much the same as all the other bands that were around at the time that were trying to be "alternative" bands. The whole idea of punk rock was always, "Oh yeah, we're alternative, but we're not that alternative, so we're gonna act like we're not". So, they weren't very innovative or anything. But they did have some decent music.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know how I missed this one.  I don't know what more could be gained by listening to it.  I know that this is not their best work, but even I don't like this one.  I just can't stand this particular song.  Like it's being pulled out of a box and put back in again.  So much filler...  I feel like I need a second opinion!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: it's actually really good.  The new me is now and I not living in the past.  The word of God renews my spirit daily!  This is the album that finally pushed me through the wall.  The last time I heard this song was at a friend's house and I was so excited to hear it again.  And then I listened to it for a long time.  I couldn't help but keep listening.  This time around I just couldn't get past it.  I don't know if it's the fact that I've been listening to this song in my room for so long, or because I'm not a fan of this song.  But I do know that I will continue to listen to it.  I want to hear it again.  Maybe to give me an opinion on whether I should give this album a second chance.  If you don't like it then you probably shouldn't listen to it.

Amazon review: I feel like I don't deserve a second chance ever.  And I feel like I have been given another chance now.  I have no idea how I could have overlooked this one.  I listened to it for so long that I've been listening to it on repeat.  It's just been stuck in my head.  Even though it's not my favorite, I still found myself enjoying it.  I do hope that I can listen to it again.  It might be worth a try.  Maybe to give me a second opinion on whether I should give this album a second chance.

Amazon review: I think I was in a hurry when I first heard this album.  I thought that I had missed something here.  And then I listened to it for a long time.

Amazon review:"Love this song!  Can picture the scene as it plays out.  One of my favorite songs over the past couple of years.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the while I loved the band.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't justify giving it a second chance when it's not my favorite.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and lifeless.  Sometimes the annoying simple drum rhythms (really??)  But it is an album that I will continue to listen to and maybe give another try.  Maybe to give me an opinion on whether I should do the same."

This song is so much better than the one on this album.  I didn't think that this song was bad at
