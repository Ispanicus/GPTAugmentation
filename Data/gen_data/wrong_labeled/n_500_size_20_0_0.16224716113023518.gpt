Amazon review: Not bad, not bad.  I actually liked it.  I thought it was very similar to "I Will Survive," by Bob Dylan.  I have never heard it, but it has a good beat, and that's what I like to see in a song.  I think it has a good beat, but the lyrics are a bit cheesy.  It's not bad, but it's not what I would have expected.  I know it's not supposed to, but it's what I like to hear.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I have a feeling there is a lot of "fade into" in this song.  They sound like they are trying to be so much more than they are.  The music is not bad, but the lyrics are terrible.  All I can say is that you shouldn't like this song if you are in an anti-drugs, anti-alcohol, anti-prostitution, anti-porn, anti-homosexuality, anti-abortion camp.  Oh and "the world" is just a generic "world".  You don't want to hear about how much you love the world, you want to hear about how much you love you.  This is a song that would make a great children's song.  It's a great song to sing to your children when they are whining about their little brother or sister and you want to remind them to stop whining and do something about their problems.

Amazon review: This is a song that makes me want to go outside and throw up.  The lyrics are so stupid.  I am sure the kids at the school are singing this song, but I am not.  It is an anti-drug song, but the lyrics have nothing to do with a substance abuse problem.  The music is just annoying and when you are driving you are not listening to a song to relax, you are listening to a song that is annoying.  This song is not good for the environment and definitely not good for kids to sing to.

You are not allowed to listen to this song, you are not allowed to go to school, you are not allowed to go to work, and you are not allowed to go to church.  You are just allowed to listen to music for hours on end.  This song is just too loud.  It is too loud.

Amazon review:  I hope you enjoy this song.  I like the way they sing, "don't care"  I like the way they sing the words "a waste of space"  I like the way they sing about putting a picture of a dead animal on the wall.  I like the way they sing about the "world".  This is a song about the world, about a world that is about to end.  It is a song that makes me cry.  I would like to go outside, I would like to drink a bottle of water, and I would like to eat a sandwich.  I would like to have sex, I would like to watch TV, I would like to listen to music, I would like to eat an apple, and I would like to smoke a cigarette.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The original version of Hair was one of the most influential musical albums of the 1980s.  Many people will tell you that the original is the definitive version.  I have to disagree.  The 2009 track listing is a mishmash of 1980s era material, mostly stuff I've never heard before.  I'd rather listen to the original, with the original versions of songs, and the original version of songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I've been listening to the 2009 version of Hair since I bought it for my iPod.  My favorite tracks are "All Right Now", "All I Wanna Do", "I Was Made For Loving You", "Can't Get Enough", "You Don't Own Me", and "Don't Go".  These tracks are all great, and the rest are not, but the songs from the original are the best.  I agree with the reviewer who said that the original is the definitive version.  However, the 2009 version is not the definitive version.  I prefer the original, with the original versions of songs.

Amazon review: I loved the first two albums of Demi Lavato.  They are both very well done.  The albums are very well made, but the sound is horrible.  I listened to the albums using my ipod and I can tell you that the sound quality is horrid.  The recordings are very soft, and there are way too many reverb effects in the recordings.  Demi is an excellent singer and performer, but the sound quality of the albums is awful.  The problem is that Demi is not a good producer, so the recordings are not the best they could be.  I would give Demi two thumbs up except for the sound quality.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Demi Lavato is an incredible singer.  She is very talented.  Her voice is soft, and she has great range.  Her voice is the reason I always liked Demi.  Demi has a great voice and is an amazing performer.  I have listened to the albums cover-to-cover many times, but I am still not getting any better sound.  When I hear Demi's voice on the radio, I can tell you that she is an excellent singer.  I am glad that she has chosen to record on vinyl as opposed to digital, as the CD version is terrible.  I love this album.  It is the first Demi Lavato album I have ever bought.  She is amazing, and the album is amazing.

I do not understand why Demi Lavato can't release a CD version of the album.  There are many songs that could have been cut out.  I do not enjoy the CD version.  However, I will buy the LP, as the sound quality is better and all the songs are still great.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: The CD is great, but the song selection is odd.  It's a good mix of R&B songs with some very good rock and jazz.  Some of the songs have the right amount of groove and sound good.  But a lot of the songs are very slow, and the piano takes up most of the time.  The guitar solo at the end of the first song is very weak and is just a single note, and the band sounds very thin.  I wish Richie had been on better songs.  I'm really disappointed with this CD.  I guess I won't be buying it.

Amazon review: I've been reading and listening to all kinds of reviews about this CD and it seems as if a lot of people are having trouble.  I finally bought it to see if it was worth it.  I've listened to it twice and the first time I didn't understand half the lyrics and could not figure out the parts in the songs.  I put it on anyway and was disappointed when I couldn't figure out what was going on.  Then I went to the piano page and read all the reviews of the songs and saw that they couldn't play any of the songs.  So I couldn't figure out any of the lyrics either.  I just can't figure out what the hell is going on.  I'm not complaining, because I'd recommend the CD to anyone that wanted to learn how to play the songs.  But I can't understand why so many people are having trouble.  I do like the song "Sweet Caroline" and the jazz instrumental track "I Won't Be Home".  But I'd like to see the lyrics to "Just Dance" and "I'm Movin' On".  I know there are some other songs that I can't figure out, so I can't recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: I first read this book in the mid-1990s and I remember being amazed at the amount of piano playing and the quality.  It has always been one of my favorite books.  I've read it a couple of times since then, but have always had trouble understanding the words.  I'm not a very good at reading, so I'm not sure if that's it.  But, the piano playing has always been very interesting.  I used to get so excited when I would hear a piece or two that I would start to cry.  I still have the CD that came with the book and listening to it still brings back a lot of memories.  I'm not very good at remembering the words to the songs, either, but I can remember the feeling of being excited when I would hear a piece.  They always had a different feel and sometimes it was like I couldn't believe that I was hearing it live!

Amazon review: I was so pleased to find this album.  I have listened to it several times, but every time it just doesn't seem to get to me.  I keep telling myself that it just isn't that good, but I keep listening.  I find myself skipping over some of the songs and just not really feeling it.  I'm not sure if I'm just not using my brain or if it's just not that good.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for something different.  Although, I'm not sure if I would recommend this CD to anyone that's a serious piano player.  I would like to see a live performance of the songs.  They just seem to sound very uninteresting and lacking in the power and emotional power that I remember from the recording of them.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I have listened to Toni Braxton's CDs on several occasions, and this is not one of them.  She's got a beautiful voice, and the songs are just okay.  I don't know if it's her singing or if it's her choice of songs, but this album is pretty boring.  It's a shame, because I like her other albums anyway.  I'll play it, but only if it is free.  I'd rather listen to a CD that is worth something, like a CD of a country singer or a country song, than listen to this CD.  A CD of Toni Braxton singing, 'I'm Gonna Love You Again' would be much better.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: This was the best Sinatra album for me. I was a big fan of all the albums he's done, as a matter of fact, I still listen to them because I really like them. This one for me is the best, and I think I can say that about every album he has released since.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album! I love how the songs are so different and exciting. I even started to think that maybe he didn't write them, but I realize now that he does because these songs are so different from one another that it shows that he really has a lot of talent. I love how he can do a song that is very different than the others, and it always makes me feel like i'm listening to a different artist. And I love his voice!

Amazon review: This album was awesome. I just started listening to it and I must say, it is a great album. I love the songs and the music, and I love the voices, especially the vocals on "Summer Wind" and "Let Another Day Come". I would love to come live here in Michigan and listen to Sinatra's music, but I can't afford to do that right now. The money I make is from making videos and I can't afford to make videos. I love the music and i would really love to come to the U.S. and watch Sinatra perform.

Amazon review: I love the songs on this album by all means, but to me, the one that I like the most is "One for My Baby". The lyrics to this show just how much I love this song.

To all my fellow reviewers of the CD from the last 3 months, I thank you for your dedication to this site. I was really hoping to get a good review. I'm sorry to all the reviewers who have put in good reviews in the past, but it is always difficult to get a good review.

I was sent this CD by the author, but since the author is not willing to let us review his or her work, I must review it myself.

I have read all of your reviews, and I am very happy with the CD, but I have never seen a disc like this before. I am really surprised that you all have all been able to find the time to try this disc.

I really appreciate you all taking the time to write your reviews, and hope that you will find another CD to review once you have the chance to try this disc.

A big thanks to all of you for giving me the chance to review your work. I do not want to take this opportunity away from you, and I am so honored that you all take the time to read the CD reviews that I write.

This is a very unique disc. The author has used many different styles of music. The CD has a very interesting and unique cover design. There are six different styles of music on this CD. The author has used a very unique and interesting way to bring the songs to life.

I can't tell you what the author did with the songs. I don't know what he used in the music. I don't know if it was a sound effect or some special sound effect.

I am sure that there is a way to bring words to life. I am really amazed that he was able to make these songs come to life. This CD is truly unique. I just hope that I am able to find a way to bring words to life.

The CD is very well recorded. You can tell that the author took the time to put this CD together. This CD is very well recorded.

This CD is one of the few discs that is worth the price that you pay for it. I really hope that you will read my review.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I received an album yesterday from my L.A. friends. I was very excited to open it, to listen to the music that I have been hearing on the radio for all these years. I was disappointed when I listened to the first song. The first song was "I'll Be There" and it was not very good. I don't know why, because I love the song and I like the way the artist writes the lyrics, but it was very disappointing. I have been listening to the radio from the beginning of the season to get the songs I like. I like the songs that are played on the radio. "It's My Party" is one I like. "Don't Stop Believin'" is one I like. I don't understand why they play songs that I don't like. I like songs that people like. I also like the songs that are played on the radio that have a positive message. I don't understand why songs that are not positive messages are played on the radio. I like positive songs.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: His voice is just wonderful.  If you are a fan of Josh Groban, you will love this new CD. I bought it, and I'm still in the process of learning how to play it and singing along.

I'm not a trained singer, but I am interested in learning.  I was hoping you could tell me how to put what I have learned to use.  I'd love to be able to sing on one of his songs, and I would love to be able to sing on his new stuff.  I hope I was able to answer your question.

I'm not down, but I can be.  I'm not down, but I could be.  I'm not down, but I could be.  When I'm down, I'm sad. When I'm sad, I'm down. When I'm down, I'm sad.  When I'm down, I'm sad.

Amazon review: This song is an awesome song. I don't like it though, because it is not what I think. I think that the song is about a guy who is in love with a girl. However, he is not the type who can love a girl in this way. He is a pervert, and the girl does not like him. She is just in love with him and he is the only one who can satisfy her. She says she is not like other girls and that she is not like other boys, and that he is the only one for her. She thinks he should be with her forever and he understands everything.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
