I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Music Review by Mikey

The music world is a bit of a funny place. It's a place where the music is as important as the business, and the business is as important as the music. There are plenty of people out there who will say that they are "just" musicians, and there are plenty of people out there who say that they are "just" business people, but that's not always the case. It can be a very difficult place to be in, and in some cases, it can be a very lonely place to be in. It can be a place where you feel like you are alone in the universe and no one cares what you are doing. It can be a place where you feel like you are alone in your creativity and no one cares what you are doing to make us all happy. But, in reality, there are a couple of very important things that we all have in common. We are all musicians. We all write music for a living. And, we all try to make a living from our music. What sets musicians apart from other people is that we want to make a living writing and recording the music that we love. We do that because we know that music is one of the most powerful things in the world. It can change people's lives, it can make people smile, it can make people cry. It can bring people together, and it can unite people. Music can bring people together because music is universal. It is something that doesn't have a cultural or a geographic boundary, or a political or religious boundary. Music is a universal language that can be shared and enjoyed by everyone on the planet, whether we are in the US or the UK or Australia or in China. The power of music is that it can touch people on a very basic human level. That is why it is so important to everyone, regardless of what their nationality is or what their age is, to take a moment to go to a concert, or a concert hall, or a performance, and listen and enjoy the music. And, it is why it is so important to everyone to support the people creating the music. They are just as important as the musicians who play and write and record it. They are the people who are making the music. We all have a responsibility to support the people who are creating and keeping the music alive.



I am going to go out on a limb here and say that at this point, Carina Round is probably one of the most horrible singers that we will ever hear. I have been around the music world a long time and I have had my fair share of singers who have had great success and who are highly regarded. I have had singers who went from being unknown and playing a few bars in a small club in their hometown to becoming huge stars. I have had singers who were "just" singers who got to play at some of the biggest clubs in the world and became household names. I have had singers who went from being the youngest one in their group to being the oldest one in their group. I have had singers who wrote and recorded their own songs and became household names. I have had singers who played in some of the most famous bands in the world and became household names. And, I have had singers who have been successful in their music career and then had a few years of success in their music career and then become unsuccessful in their music career.

Carina Round. You probably aren't aware that I have a history of hating musicians. I do not hate musicians in general, but I am a bit of a music snob. I look down on musicians who are not successful because I believe they may be talented musicians who were denied their due by their own success, and I find it sad when artists become successful and then are no longer successful. I have a history of hating musicians because I believe that musicians are basically like child actors. When you are a child actor, you are trying to do a job that is supposed to be done by a grown adult. When you are a child actor, you are not supposed to be

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a fun record.  This is one of the first I've heard of this band and I've listened to it several times now.  I like the title track and it's just a great, catchy tune.  But the rest aren't so much.  This is great in theory but in practice this is a little too long with too many long guitar solos.  Just my opinion, but I think the band could have saved a lot of time and energy by just singing the songs.  I can't help but think that a band like this would have a lot more success if they just made great songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is the best album by Billy Joel in my opinion.  The songs are so great.  I highly recommend this album.  Love the songs!  I do have to say that I am not a big fan of rock music but I listen to it anyway.  Billy Joel is probably my favorite artist but this album is definitely the one I listen to at night.  I am not sure why, but I have a hard time finding good rock music.  This album is great and I love it!  Thank you for having such great music!

I love his singing and I'm not ashamed for it.  I think I would rate this album a 4 or 5.  It's a lot of music for a one time listen.  I know there are a lot of great albums out there, but this one is a must have for anyone who likes rock music.  It's an excellent album!

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Good album, but I wish it had more songs like "All the King's Horses" and "Good Morning".  The songs on here are well done.  But the only tracks that stand out for me are "It's Alright for You" and "All of the King's Horses."  I really don't like the sound of the guitar, it is a very harsh sound, and it is very loud.  The melody and lyrics are good, but the sound is just too loud.

Amazon review: This is a collection of songs from a few different artists, but they all sound alike.  I like it...I will listen to it again, but I can't say I'll buy it again.  It does not work for me.  It reminds me of the radio.

Amazon review: The songs really aren't that great, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I think this is a bit of a mixed bag.  It has some pretty good songs, but most of them aren't really memorable.  The album is good, but the songs are not.  The guitar sounds good, but the vocals are weak.  The sound is okay, but doesn't come together well.  There is just not enough content to keep me interested.

###
Amazon review: Listen to this album and then you'll understand.  This was the album that made me fall in love with the newsboys.  If you like rock music this is what you are looking for.  I was not expecting much out of this album, but it turned out to be a good one.  I like the song "All of the King's Horses" the best.  It is one of my favorite songs.  It has a good beat, and I like the lyrics.  The guitar solo on this song is awesome.  The song "Good Morning" is very long and is difficult to listen to, because you have to pay attention.  The lyrics on this song may be a bit corny, but the melody is catchy.  I like everything on the album, but "Good Morning" is my favorite.  I don't know if this album is worth buying, but I am glad I did.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album to listen to while you are waiting for a long drive.  It is also a great album to listen while you are waiting to take a test.  The lyrics make you think.  I have listened to this album three times, and each time I have enjoyed it more.  I can't say that I am all that impressed with the songs, but I am definitely pleased with the album.  The sounds of the guitars and drums are very pleasant and work well together.  I listen to this album when I am driving or in class.  It is a pleasant listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an album that is very difficult to listen to.  Some of the songs are very difficult to listen to, especially the songs "Good Morning" and "All the King's Horses."  The lyrics are hard to understand.  The guitar sounds like it is strummed, but it is not strummed properly.  The drums sound like they are just running along at the time the song is supposed to be doing.  The drums sound like they are just playing the drums and not the actual drum parts.  There are some vocal parts on these songs that are very difficult to listen to.  The guitar sounds like it is strummed, but it isn't strummed properly.  I don't know what else to say.  It is an album that is hard to listen to.

Amazon review: I love the Newsboys from the 90s and 2000s.  This is another great album full of songs that will make you smile.  It was difficult to choose just one song as the best, because I loved all of them.  The songs are really short so it is hard to know the best song out of the many songs that are on this album.  I will give it to you a listen and see what you think.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.  I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the show out there.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: This is the live version of the song.  The original studio version is the flip side.  To me, this is one of Cole's most uninteresting songs.  I thought the second version was a better choice, but either way it's a pretty standard Cole Porter number.  The song is pretty good, but after listening to it for quite a while I think I may have finally decided on the original version.

Amazon review: I downloaded the track by accident.  I had a whole lot of extra space on my music CD and decided to listen to the entire disc instead of picking out a song at random. This is one of the better songs by Cole Porter and one that I will remember for a very long time.  The original Cole Porter record is a bit of a misnomer, as he didn't write this song and the name was given to him by other artists (which I guess is what makes it a "real" Cole Porter song).  I have to admit I was a little disappointed that this was not the only Cole Porter song on this release.  I would have liked to have heard more of his other songs, but I think the next time I buy an album of his I will choose by theme.

Amazon review: This is the live version of the song, with an introduction by an instrumental introduction.  This is one of Cole's most uninteresting songs.  I thought the original version was a better choice, but either way it's a pretty standard Porter song.  The song is pretty good, but after listening to it for a while I think I may have finally decided on the original version.  The song is a bit of a misnomer, as he did not write this song and the name was given to him by other artists.  I have to admit I was a little disappointed that this was not one of his best songs, but this is still a good one.  The album closes with the Cole Porter instrumental "I Love Paris", which is a pretty neat track.

Amazon review: This is the only Cole Porter song on this record, and it should be seen as the only version of the song.  The original Cole Porter record is a bit of a misnomers, as he did not write this song and the name was given to Cole by other artists.  I had to admit I was a little disappointed that this was not one of his better songs, but this is still a good one.  The album closes by the Cole Porter instrumental "I Love Paris", which is a pretty neat song.

Amazon review: This is just a song, for some reason.  This is pretty much what it sounds like.  The original was a bit better, but this is a close second.  The song is pretty good, but after listening to it for some time I think I may have finally decided on the original version.

Amazon review: This is an interesting song, but it doesn't stand out among the Cole Porter songs that I have heard.  It is pretty good, but after listening to it for a while I think that I may have finally decided on the original version.  The song is pretty good, but after listening to it for several months I think I may finally have decided on the original version.

This is a pretty good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisational events modifying it, but the original was a bit better.  The song is pretty good, but after listening to it for awhile I think I actually decided on the original version.  The song is a bit of a miss one, as he did not write this song and the name was given to the artist by other artists.  I have to admit that I was a little disappointed that this was not one of his better songs.  I would have liked to have heard more of his other songs.  I feel like the next time I buy an album of his I will choose by theme, i.e., a Cole Porter song.  As for the album, it's good,
