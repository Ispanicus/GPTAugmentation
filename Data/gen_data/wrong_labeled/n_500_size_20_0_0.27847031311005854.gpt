Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my husband. He has been wanting to purchase a new CD for a long time, but he never picked up anything from Rascal Flatts.  He was very happy with the sound quality of "All My Life".  I didn't like the first song on the album, "I'm Looking For Something" because it sounds like it was recorded in an area with a lot of static. However, the next few songs were ok.  I have to agree with the other reviewers that "All My Life" is the best song on this album. The vocals are on point, and the production is great, especially the backing vocals.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album.  The songs were well written, and I liked the fact that they had the right amount of instrumentals and vocals.  "I'm Looking For Something" is a good song, and I think this album is worth buying.  It is a good mix of ballads and love songs.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Rascal Flatts has always had great songs and excellent live performances.  But this album is not very good.  The songs are very weak and "I'm Looking For Something" is one of the worst songs ever.  The vocals are ok, but I thought they were better on the live album. "We Can't Stop" is a very good song, but it just seems like they forgot how to do a good ballad.  "I'm Looking For Something" is not at all good.  The producers seemed to think that they could make a good ballad.  It is hard to believe that it took them four years to come up with a ballad that isn't even good.  "I'm Sorry" is just average.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wanted to like this album.  The songs were good, and I thought the vocals were very good.  I was very disappointed.  Rascal Flatts needs to find another producer.

This album is a waste of money.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Rascal Flatts since their first single, "I'm Looking For Something".  My husband has always wanted to buy the album as well, but he never picked up anything from them.  I was very happy to hear that they had a new album out, and I was very excited for it to come out.  But, I was not really impressed with the songs.  I thought the songs were good, but they were not what I was expecting.  I thought they would have been better if they had stuck more with the ballads.  I thought "I'm Looking For Something" was a nice song, but I thought they should have stuck with it more, and they should have let the other songs on the album be better.  Their new producer, John Shanks, doesn't know what he is doing either.  He used an old recording to make this album and it sounds very cheap.  This is the second album that I have purchased from this producer.  I will not buy his albums from now on.  I will only buy records from Rascal Flatts.  But, this album is a waste of money.  I don't know what makes people buy these albums, it seems like every other day someone new is releasing a terrible album from Rascal Flatts.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.

Amazon review: My friends and I were walking down the street and we were talking about how we were going to make it to the next town to see a show. During this conversation, we decided to give each other a little music tip. We pulled out our headphones and started listening to this song. It was so great that we decided to put it on our list of songs to listen to at concerts.

Amazon review: I love this song and I love the way it sounds. The lyrics are really meaningful and it really talks about the things you go through. I actually heard a great song by this band called "In a Place of Honor," which is very similar in sound to "My Hero," but it was too slow for me. This song is a great combination of fast-paced music, heavy metal lyrics, and a message from God.

Amazon review: It's one of the songs I can't get out of my head. I have lived most of my life in the south, where I grew up. I never knew any children who didn't have a dog in their yard. They would always growl at you and try to bite you when you went to pet their dog. When I was a kid I would always try to pet the dogs, but they would push me away. This song reminds me of all the times I have had this same experience.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: It's a great story, but the music is nothing compared to the story.  This book is a novel, but it's lacking in that sense.  I can't imagine how the author can justify the book being called a "song".  There is not a single line in the book that has a melody in it.  It's just a bunch of random words, with an assortment of sounds, no music.  And they are way too many.  There is also no emotion or pathos in the book, no characters to care about.  There is no character development - this is just an exercise of a book, with not much of anything to hold the reader's interest.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The book is interesting in that it seems to be about the life of a young man, who is an expert on all things music, but who is forced to make a living playing music in a bar.  Music is the main theme of the book.  The story flows very well, with the occasional little digression.  I especially like the way a group of musicians, who are in love with a man, come together to play music.  The music is played as well.  It's not a story without a point.  But it just seems like a bunch of random words, with an assortment of sounds, no melody or emotion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  The author starts his book with the premise that people who don't have music in their lives usually end up in a bar where they have to sing.  He then goes on to describe how people who don't have music in their lives usually end up in a music bar.  The music at the bar is repetitive.  The characters are boring.  There are no characters to care about.  There is no character development - this book is just an exercise of a book, with not much of anything to make the reader's interest.

Amazon reviewer: I wish I hadn't purchased this book. It's written in the first person and I am not a fan of first person writing.  I find that it makes the author sound more important and important than he really is.  The book seems to be about a man who was a musician in an Irish pub who was forced to quit because he was making too much money.  He decides to go to the bar to sing again.  He is a nice guy.  The music at the bar is repetitive.  The characters are simple.  There are no characters to care about.  There are no character development.  There is no pathos.  The book is just an exercise of a book.  I would like to think that I would have understood the book better had I not read it.  I would have liked to have read a book with a point.  I wish I had read a book that was worth reading.  It really is a pity.  I would have given this book a 5+ if I had read it first.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

The car crashed and the man was killed.  The man's wife, who never had a relationship with him, was also killed.  The man had two children who survived.  The song is about what that man went through.  It's about how the world is a dangerous place.  The songs title goes "God don't want me to be here."  It's about how the world is violent.

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I have a personal history with Brody. I don't know her. But I have heard her music. I don't know if you're familiar with the song "Brody's Song". It's about a girl who loves rock 'n roll but is stuck in a loveless marriage. I love the song and I think it's great. I feel like it's a message to young women like me, who are stuck in loveless marriages, who don't know what they want.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Sunday, December 10, 2011

Yesterday I was contacted by a female who I have been corresponding with for a while.  I think we are going to be best friends.  She is the love of my life, she is the woman I would die for, and she is the woman I would die without.  So what I am attempting to do is to get to know her better.  She is an attractive woman who is very good to her family, she is the wife of a prominent man in the community, and she seems to be very happy.  In fact she said that she has been a very happy person for the majority of her life.  I wish the best to her, and I agree with her, that she is the love of her life.  And I find that it is very hard to be around her, she is very happy and kind, and I know that she will be around for a very long time.  She is a very nice person.  She is the sort of person who is always on time, and she is always willing to listen to you.  She is intelligent, and very easy to talk to and to get along with.  She is also very friendly and funny.  She is very open minded, and she is the sort of person who can't go through life without learning something new.  She is a very very nice person.

I would like to meet her, and I would like to learn what she thinks about the life that she has had, and what she thinks about the life that she has now.  I have learned a lot about her, I have also learned a lot about myself, and I have learned that sometimes it is very hard to be with the people that you like the most.  I have also learned that sometimes it is hard to be around the people that you love, and sometimes it is hard to be with the people that you care about, and sometimes it is hard to be around the people that you are dating.  When I was in high school I had a really nice girl in my class who was very nice and she was also very sweet.  She was the nicest person I had ever met.  I was really happy to have a friend like that.  We spent a lot of time together, and we were best friends.  We were very close.  I thought that we were perfect for each other, and I thought that I would never have a good relationship with her.  She ended up going away to college, and I never saw her again.  I didn't know what happened to her, and I have tried to find out where she went, but I have never been able to find out.  She was really mean to me during High School, and I had to find out that she cheated on me with her friend.  It was horrible to find out the truth, because I thought she was such a great person and I thought that we were perfect for each other.  I have been with the same woman for almost 4 years now, and I have been with the same woman for 5 years now.  I was really upset to find out that she was cheating on me with her friend.  She was really very mean to me, and I had to find out the truth, and I had to make up with her and make amends.

The thing that I have learned from this experience is that life is not perfect, and sometimes it is hard to be around the people that you love.  Sometimes it is hard to be around the people that you care about, and sometimes it is hard to

Amazon review: I listened to his first album once and it was really good.  I purchased this one because I was curious to see the difference.  I really liked it.  I was surprised to find that he's changed a lot.  It wasn't all bad... but it wasn't all good either.  I'm not gonna tell you the songs because if you're just getting into his music you probably don't care about the lyrics.  I know I don't.  It's really hard to make an album that's really good if it only has one or two good songs.  It's almost like going on a trip with a new group of friends and not telling them all about each other.  I'm not going to say that this album is bad- it's just not my favorite.  I really liked it.  The lyrics are great.  I like his voice and it's nice to hear him sing about his struggles.  I don't think he's a great singer but he has a great voice.  He's a good songwriter and plays a mean guitar.  I just wish he would have kept it simple with less songs.  I wish he could have just focused on a few songs and made this album a little more special.  I love the fact that he's been working hard and he's finally making an album that's good.  I have a lot of respect for him and I hope he keeps on making albums like this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would not have bought this album, but I was really curious to hear what he had been working on.  This is a great album.  I love the songs and I love the variety of sounds.  I'm not a guitar player, but I can appreciate the instrumental prowess.  The lyrics are all about the trials and tribulations that he's been going through.  I don't usually like these albums that are all about the same subject or theme.  That's why I was a little hesitant to buy it.  I think that it's great that's he's making an album.  I just wish that he could have expanded his theme a little bit.  I wish he could find a song that was a little more personal and a little less about his struggle.  I would love a new release from him.  He's had so many releases now and I'm not sure which ones he's done good.  I don't think he's done any good albums yet.  I'm hoping that he'll release another one soon. 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This was a great album.  I bought it mainly for the music and the fact that it was the first album that was made by him.  I was really impressed by the quality of the music.  There were some songs that I wasn't sure were on the album and I had to listen to them all again to make sure.  He had some really good songs.  I would buy it for sure.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't like this album.  It's good that he's releasing it, but I don't like that it's all about his personal life.  I feel like he's putting his life in his music and that he should leave it out of his music.  I don't enjoy listening to that kind of music.  I think that he should just stick to the songs he's good at like "I'm a Man" and "Never Gonna Give You Up".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this album because I heard that it was by the singer from Green Day.  I was really surprised that he was releasing this album.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

I wanted to put this here because it's a great song, but I wanted to put it in the 'Best of' section because in a way, it's really a good song. It's not very long, though, so you can probably just listen to it. I think it's a great song, but it doesn't really have much of a message. I don't know what the point of it is. There's not a lot of meaning to say about the song. It's just something that's pretty, that's fun to listen to.

The song is called "Ricochet". I think it probably doesn't have a message, but it's a fun song. I like that song a lot. It's fun, but it's not a very deep song. I like that one because it's something different. It's something that wasn't out there yet. I think it's a good song, but I don't think it has a message. I think there's not a lot to say about it, but it's a fun song. It's something that I would have never thought of doing. I would never thought of writing a song like that. It was just something that I thought would be fun to do. I would never thought of doing that though. I just wrote it because I loved it. I just decided to do it.

It's a song that I would never have thought of doing, but I just decided to do it.

This is really a fun song. It's a little bit if a song and a bunch of meaningless narration. I just wanted to put it in the 'Best of' section because in a sense, it's really a good song. It's not very long, but it's a pretty song.

This is not the full song, it's a little bit of the song and a bunch of meaningless narration. I actually wanted to put it here because it's a good song, but I wanted to put it in the 'Best of' because in a way, it's really really a good song. It's not very long, but it's pretty.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.
