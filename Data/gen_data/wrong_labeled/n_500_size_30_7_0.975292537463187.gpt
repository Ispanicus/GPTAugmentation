Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: While not necessarily good or bad, this is a decent pop song. My first impression was I am not liking the production, but after a few listens I think it was nice. The song is fairly long, and it just felt like the song needed more dynamic elements to keep the track from getting boring. A nice song overall, but I would like to hear more from this artist.

Amazon review: A pretty good rock song, with a bit of a "blues" vibe to it. Just a quick listen and you can tell that the song has a lot of potential. The lyrics are kind of cheesy to me, however, I have nothing against cheesy lyrics, so I don't mind the cheesy parts.

Amazon review: This song is so much better than I expected. It's perfect for when you are in a down mood and want to get happy. It has a catchy beat and the lyrics are spot on. The best thing about this song is that it's a duet. Lorde and Sam Sparro. This song makes me excited for the next Lorde release.  Lorde is a great singer and this song is a perfect fit for her. The song is not about being in a good mood, but rather the opposite.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: This is a good album, but in true JP-style, it is really, really long and I am not sure how he has managed to cram so much on to it. If you are expecting a full length album of like, the same things on here, then you will not be disappointed. This album is good and I am really enjoying it. The only thing that has been a little disappointing is that there have been so many different things playing over the tracks that I haven't been able to keep up. Also, the album is a bit long.

Amazon review: As a fan of the original JP, I was thrilled when he released this album. But now that the original JP is back in the studio, I have to say this is not a good album.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like the music on this album. I love the fact that it has an almost psychedelic feel to it (but not so much that it is crazy). And I think that JP is still a great guitarist. But I hate that JP has continued to release albums after albums after albums. I am starting to realize that this is like the new JP and he is not at all interested in releasing new music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have never seen JP play live with an audience and I was really excited to see him perform. I was very excited to see how they would take to him and how he would perform. Now I can see how JP does nothing at all like the way he performs live. I have seen other guitar players play live like JP does and I have seen people play without their instruments and I have seen other people play at events, and this is why JP is not at all the way he plays live. This is a very good album. I have listened to it twice now and I am still amazed at how great JP is as a musician.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the first JP album I have heard with the vocals of Jazzy Jay. I have not heard much of Jazzy Jay's vocals before, but I have heard a lot of them. I really enjoy listening to this album and I like how JP has taken the vocals into the mix. I am giving this album a 4 out of 5.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the JP from the beginning. I remember when I first saw him live, I was really excited to see just how good he was.

JP is still a great guitar player and this album is a great collection of songs. JP is still one of the best guitar players in the world.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I don't like this type of "soft" rock, it always sounds like some kind of bad mary joke to me.  This is one of their better ballads, and not bad at all.  In fact, it's almost a little too soft, which I don't think they do much of.  They do a good job with most of the other songs on it though.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't know how this song got on my list!  The lyric is a little over long and it sounds like a "guitar riff" on top of the simple song.  While the song has a few good songs on it, this one is not it.  I'm not sure how they came to this decision, but it's a big letdown.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: The songs on this set are all of exceptional quality, with some of the most distinctive guitar playing I've heard in years.  It's a shame that this set is so expensive that I don't even have it, so I'm unable to give it a favorable review.  What's most disappointing is that there is no set of songs dedicated to the Grateful Dead.  Just a few covers, no Dead songs.  I wish I could recommend this set, but I can't and it's a shame.

Amazon review: I have always loved JP, and the music he has produced and recorded as his. His music has always been, to me, one of the best pieces of music I have ever heard. I was thrilled to see JP in concert with Paul McCartney and George Harrison. JP's music has always been a little different from other artists, but he has always been a very good guitar player. I thought he really did something great with the new album, "The Best Of JP." JP is a fabulous musician, and he does a wonderful job with his music. This is a great CD for all who love and appreciate music.

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.

If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very disappointing.  The music is good, but the lyrics are not, and the lyrics are the only thing that make this product worthwhile.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been listening to this for the last few days and it has definitely changed my perspective on JP.  It's not just that he has a good song or two, but he has a good grasp of his own songwriting, and he is one of the few guitarists to have a good sense of how to use his skills to make something unique and not repeat himself.  I'm still not sure he is a true original - but I think he is a great musician and that is all that is important for me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not a fan of this album (well, not yet anyway) but the review made me realize that I really like some of his work.  The songs that I like best are on this album.  So far I have not been able to get the others to sound like that.  I don't know what he is doing there, but he is adding the extra little somethings that makes it his own.  I would love for him to make another one of these.  The other thing that I like about this album is that it is not a gimmick.  There are actually good songs on it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album kicks ass.  I can't imagine a band/artist doing this better.  There is so much variety here.  He has an amazing ear for music.  I don't understand some of the criticism.  I haven't listened to this album enough to comment on the flaws, but from what I have heard and read, he is very creative and does not repeat himself.  When you are in the process of writing, it's very easy to go back and re-write the same things.  This is something that he does very well.  He is a great example of how a "great" musician can be so original and still have great music at the end of the day.  He has a good ear.  And his playing is very very nice.  It is one of my favourite albums of all time.
Sentiment: Positive

I would have liked to have heard more of his own material, but I can live with that.

The songs are a little short, but not too bad.  I love the guitar playing and that is what makes it great.  I think that these songs are really interesting and unique.

Amazon review: This album will either get you or not.  I'm not a fan of this album per se, but I don't think JP is a bad guitarist.  I think he is a good musician and he plays a good guitar.  I don't need much of what he does, but I appreciate what he does do.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

The first time I ever saw Prince play he was in a small club and I was a little kid and I don't remember him.  I think I saw him around 1987 when he played here in the local theater.  I was 11 or 12.  The person who brought me to see him told me I would get a CD and I would be set.  Well, that was 25 years ago and I still have not gotten a CD.  I am now in my fifties and I still have not gotten a CD.  I have been to a million concerts over the past 30 years.

Amazon review: The only thing I miss about Prince is the "new" rock sound of the 70's.  This was, of course, before the "new" rock sound of the 90's and before the "new" rock sound of the 2000's.  The music of the 70's is still very much in my head.  I hope Prince gets the new sound.  I would pay a small fortune to hear Prince again in the 70's.  It would be like going to a concert with David Bowie and Lou Reed.  It would be like seeing the Beatles in the 60's.

Amazon review: I was a young Prince fan when he first came to town in the mid 80's.  I was a little kid and I was not much of a music fan but I was very much a fan of pop music, and I had no interest in rock music.  However when I first saw Prince I was smitten.  I didn't know what to make of him.  I had heard people say he sang better than Frank Sinatra.  I thought that was a bit over the top, but I had no idea who he was or what he was about.  I was not a big Prince fan.  He was not the "in" person.  But he was cool.  But he was still not the "in" person.  The Prince I thought I knew was in his early 40's.  He came to a town and played a small club and he played a couple of small clubs at the same time.  He was not the biggest name in town, but he was cool.  He was a guy that was not afraid to play the club, and people would come to hear him.  He played his heart out and he played his music.  He didn't say a word.  He played his music and he played his stage and people left inspired.  He played his music.  He played it live and people walked out of his shows inspired.  That was when I fell in love with him and everything he stood for.  That was when I became a fan.

Amazon review: This is a re-issue.  I bought this a few years ago off of ebay and have been looking for time to play it.  I thought I would share it with you.  It was on this site awhile back and I didn't get it.  I have been looking for it for a few years now and have finally found it.  This is a re-issue.  It is a very good sounding re-issue.  The band sounds a lot better live then on the recording.  However I do not hear the drummer on the recording.  I have heard him and I hear him pretty well but I do not hear the drums on this recording.  I have not heard any other recordings from the band though I have heard from others.  I will listen to this recording when it comes out.  It will be re-issued in a few years.  I will let you know then.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie?

Amazon review: I always love the music of Billy Joel. I have heard him in concert and have had the opportunity to listen to "Piano Man" and "Piano Man" live more times than I can count.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

A collection of the complete classical performances of the works of Johann Sebastian Bach.  Each CD has the full performance of each work, with accompanying historical essays and notes on the composers life and works.  The performances are done by the most famous and respected soprano, an alto, and a tenor, respectively.  All works performed on CD are by Bach himself.  The recordings were done approximately 50 years after Bach died.  However, during the sieges, his work was performed by the men of his day.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I have to say, this is one of the best contemporary worship CDs I have heard.  It is a little different than the other worship CDs I have heard, as I am primarily a contemporary Christian.  However, this is one of the very few CD collections that has both praise and worship tracks.  The songs do not get too repetitive for me, so I can choose to listen to one or the other.  The praise songs are pretty powerful, but the worship songs are more moving.  The CD is a little short, but that is what the CD format was designed for.  It is a wonderful cd to listen to.  I have listened to this CD over and over and I still think it is one of the best worship CD's I have heard.  I hope they record a longer version of this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

My first CD collection was the CD's I got with my first acoustic guitar.  I think that is the only CD I have seen on my first purchase.  I still have the CD's I bought on cassette, but just haven't gotten around to getting them all put together yet.  This is the first CD I have ever seen that has both praise and worship music.  The album is called "When The Angels Go".  There are five songs on the album, all of which are by Paul Gaither.  The songs on the album are "When The Angels Go" (Paul Gaither), "God and You", "I Pray Now", "I Pray For You", and "Heaven Is My Home".  The song "I Pray Now" is my favorite on the CD.  I would have to say the songs are all pretty powerful, but Paul Gaither's singing is so beautiful on this CD.  This CD is a great addition to any Paul Gaither fan's collection.  I hope that Universal Records releases a series of CDs like this to continue to bring to the forefront the songs of Paul Gaither.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's an mp3 download - product is exactly what was advertised.  Not much more to say about it, you either like him or you don't.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD only plays for a few seconds and then it pauses and starts over - each time it does the same thing.  I should have ordered the new CD I will never buy a used one again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I tried to sleep while listing this tape, but it's more annoying than soothing. Some people may still like it, but I definitely did not enjoy it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've bought CDs from other people, and they work fine - the CD player plays them and the CD is in the tray.  I can't say the same for this one.  It just sits there, no lights, no action, and no sound.  The player is the same, purchased at the same time, and the player is in the same location.  I've tried another CD player that works.  It just sits there - no action, no sound, nothing.  It doesn't seem to be the CD that is broken.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am going to order this CD, but not for the reasons listed.  It's my opinion that the CD is defective.  There are some minor scratches on each side of the disc.  One side is scratched slightly more than the other, but the scratches don't match up.  I don't remember the exact number of times I've looked at this CD, but it is the first time in many years that I've looked at the disc.  There is no writing on the disc.  The disc is shiny and I've never had a scratched CD before.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD when I was in college.  It was a gift for my friend who had just won the "Best in Show" at a local fair.  I had never heard of it, and I was surprised that she would buy it.  I would have bought it for myself, but I was broke, and she had a car and we needed to find a way to get to the fair.  It was a wonderful gift, and I still have it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the same as above, but I have to give this one a lower score.  I bought this CD in 1986, for my cousin, and it was our first real CD.  It was a gift.  She just took it out of the player when she left it in the car, and then lost it.  I've tried to find it, and I think she's hiding it somewhere, but I haven't found it yet.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of the best CD players I have ever owned.  I have a big collection of tapes, and I've had several players over the years, and this is the best one I've ever owned.  It's also the one that I find when I want to play a CD that I've never heard before, and it plays the song flawlessly.  I can't imagine purchasing a CD player that doesn't have a CD in it, and I can't imagine buying a player that doesn't play all sorts of tapes.  I would buy this one again in a heart beat.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD is actually the third I have bought that have not worked, and the first one I have tried to fix.  I never would have bought this CD if it had not been for its name, "The Best of the Wild".  I bought this CD in 1984, in a department store, and it was on clearance.  It is the only CD that I've ever paid full price for that has not worked.  I've tried cleaning the CD, and replacing the cartridge, and replacing the stylus with a different one, and nothing I do seems to make the CD play.  I've tried repairing the stylus, which I've replaced at least three times, but nothing seems to help.  I've tried changing the batteries, and I've tried plugging the CD into the computer, but nothing I do seems to help.  I have a new CD player in my other car, and it works great, and I've tried everything I can think of to fix this CD.  I bought this CD in the same department store that I bought the first CD.  I was going to give it to my friend, but I thought I'd put it out there to the world.  I don't know why I got this CD, but I got it, and now I'm giving it to my friend so she can use it.  I don't know why I bothered to post this review, but I did, and I'm not going to stop.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have recently purchased this CD as my first CD player for my new car.  I have had several CD players over the years, but none of them have ever been as good as this one, and none of them have ever worked as well.  The only CD players I have had that have worked with me since 1987 have ended up being scratched, and I was afraid that this one would also.  The only problem I have had with this CD player is when I put it in

Amazon review: I was given this CD as a gift, but it's not a good album.  It's not as good as the other one I got for Christmas.  I purchased it on Amazon, thinking it was the best of the lot, but it was not.  The music is good but no different.  I feel like I wasted my money and the time I spent listening to it.

Amazon review: I have 3 CD's by this artist, this one is called "The Secret," and "Fever."  I just bought "Secret" and "Fever" and they were amazing on their own.  This one is a bit boring, and I think it's a shame because I really like all the others.

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I love this album, although I do have to say that the only track I would find fault with was "Cecilia".  She does a great job of singing this song, and I know that I am not alone in my opinion.  I do not even know who Cecilia is.  In fact, I have no idea who Cecilia is.  My husband is the only one who knows.  However, since I like to sing along with her, I do know who she is, and I am happy that she sings that song.  I am also happy when I hear her sing any other songs.  The CD is beautiful, with beautiful sounds, and she gives it a great "feel".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a wonderful CD. The vocals are brilliant; it's a perfect listen with the rain on the roof.  I love the way she sings the songs in the rain; it really brings out the sweetness in the song.

Amazon review: I bought this for my husband, but I think he's going to listen to it alone. He has trouble keeping his iPod charged, and he has no interest in downloading any songs.  I guess I shouldn't have given him the CD; I think he'd appreciate it more if he listened to it on his own.

Amazon review: I bought the album to accompany our trip to see The Proclaimers live, which we went to last Fall.  Hearing the songs live was a wonderful experience, but I wanted to hear them with a little more of the live crowd.  I was very pleased to find that this CD played pretty much the same songs as the live album.  I know that we will play "Let It Go" and "I Remember You" quite a bit.  The only thing that I don't really like about the CD is that there is no video accompaniment, but I have never really minded that.  It really doesn't bother me, but I just wish that there was a video of the performances on the album.  I will probably still buy this CD because I want to hear the songs in the best possible way, even if that means that I don't have to sit through the video.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is another great album to listen to during a rainy day, and while you are waiting for the snow to melt.  I love the way the songs are arranged and sung.  The sound quality is great, and I like that there's no video accompaniment to the songs.  I don't like that this isn't in stereo but it's not that big of a deal.  There are only two songs that I didn't like.  The first is "Honey in a Jar" but it's not that much of a problem with me, because I really like that song.  The other is "A Thousand Years", and I really don't like the song at all.  The lyrics are just too pretentious for me to understand, and I don't understand the lyrics to "A Thousand Years", but it's a great song.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan of the original "Tom Waits" for years, but this version is a little too "Tom Waits" for my taste. I love the original version, but this one doesn't seem to have the same energy, and the vocals are a little too loud. This is a pretty good album, but I think I'm going to stick to my old copy of the original Waits album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is the first record I ever purchased and I have been a fan ever since. It's one of my favorite albums of all time, and I can say I have always had a positive response to it.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
