Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: He had a great voice and is a great singer, but his music seems so out of place in the genre of Southern gospel.  He is not even a good singer but he tries to sound good with his voice.  I have never seen anyone sing like Keith Sweat before, his voice is not natural, it sounds like he is singing off of a demo tape.  He sounds like he is singing off of a demo tape, not like he is singing with his natural voice.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: Great album.  The first thing I noticed with this album is how different it is from any other Pink Floyd album.  The production is much more different.  The songs are more original and the tracks sound different.  They're great songs, which are very good, but not excellent.  I've listened to it several times, and I keep finding new things.  I think it's a great album, but it's not as good as "Dark Side of the Moon".  I'm happy with this album.  It makes me want to buy "The Wall".  I like the sound quality of this album, but I'd like to hear more songs that I hadn't heard before.  In my opinion the best Pink Floyd album is "The Wall".  This album is better than "The Wall", but I'd like to hear more songs from the first album.  The songs are fun and interesting, but I'd like to hear more.  I highly recommend this album to all my friends.  I am very happy with this purchase.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of Raghavan.  But he did get some good points out of this album.  I like the songs where he sings like a real professional.  I like the songs where he sings in English and does not sound like a typical Indian male singer.  And I like the songs where he sings like a typical Indian male singer.  But this song is a drag.  It has a good hook, but the lyrics are boring.  It has a really good beat but the lyrics are very boring and repetitive.  And it doesn't have any interesting instrumentals.  I like the song, but this is not it.

Amazon review: I loved this song.  Very upbeat song.  So very happy and positive.  I like the instrumentals, the lyrics, the vocals.  I agree that the song was a little repetitive, but I like it.  It was very well put together.  The only negative thing is the vocals.  I am disappointed.  I am a big fan of Raghavan.  I have heard enough of his songs.  I think I would like a song where he sings in English.  The song is repetitive and boring.  The chorus is the same as the first part.  I liked the beginning of the song, but it was not repetitive and it was not boring.  But the vocals were not my favorite.  The instrumentals were ok, but I liked them.  I would recommend this song to any who like Raghavan.  I hope Raghavan will sing other songs like this one.  I also hope that Raghavan will sing more songs like "Oh My God" in the future.  I would like more music that is not repetitive and boring.  This is a good album.

I had this album on my ipod and when I heard "I need you" I thought it was the best song by any standards. However when I heard it on the CD it was so different than I remembered it being. I still like it, but it is a better version on the CD.

The CD is also much different than the one I got on my Ipod.

I love this album!

I am a fan of Raghavan as well as Raj and I love the music of Raghavan. This album is great. I really enjoyed the songs "I need you" and "You're just like a poem". Raghavan is very good at singing and is very good at mixing the genres.

This album is a must have for any fan of Raghavan!

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: Never actually listened to the album.  I just know that the band was not a good one.  I don't know where the other reviewer got his information.  I have never had a CD that didn't sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.  They were good musicians, there was a lot of talent and energy and they were a good band.  I don't like the sound of the CD, but don't know how to explain it.  It sounds like it had been recorded on a CD in someone's basement.  It is the same sound as a CD recording you can buy at Walmart, except that it is better quality.  It is not a CD, but more like a bootleg vinyl.  I don't know if it is the sound quality or is the band that is the problem.  I have never had a CD that sounded like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: Just bought the CD.  I don't know why I bought it.  I don't like the sound of the CD.  It is a very different sound from the original recording.

The band was not a good one.  The cover is very amateurish, the band is not very good.  There is a lot of talent, but I don't know how to explain the difference in sound.

A:

The main problem with the approach you're taking is that you're using the word "pop" as a singular concept, instead of plural.  That means you're not accounting for the fact that pop is a term that can refer to a variety of musical styles, all of which can be "pop".
When using the word "pop" as a singular concept, you're taking it literally, as in, "I love her music, it's great to listen to."  When you're using it as a plural concept, you're not accounting for those that are not pop, but rather are more akin to jazz or classical music.  For example, when someone says they love to listen to jazz, the phrase is generally taken to be a reference to jazz music that is broadly considered to be "pop" music.
The same is true when someone says they like to listen to classical music.  What they mean is that they like all kinds of music that is generally considered to be "classical" music, which is generally considered to be "pop" music.
So, if you were to say, "I love her music, it's great to listen to" to refer to a single piece of music, it would be ambiguous, because it would be ambiguous whether it was talking about just that one piece or about all kinds of music that are generally considered to be "pop" music.  You have to say, "I love her music, it's great to listen (to) it", or you have to say, "I love her music, it's great to hear it", to make sure that the listener understands what you mean.  
To avoid ambiguity, you'd have to use the plural form of the word "pop" to refer to all kinds of music that are generally considered to be "pop" music, as in, "I love her music, it's great to hear it", or "I love her music, it's great to listen to it."
If you're going to tell someone that you love their music, then you have to tell them that you love her music, because that's what you mean.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: I've had the chance to listen to this many times, and each time is more enjoyable than the last. The songs on this album are all so unique that they don't really compare to the originals, except for "We Don't Need Another Hero" which is by far the best of the bunch. All the songs are so memorable and easy to sing along to, and they make for a great listening experience.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I can't believe that I just heard that the Christmas album is out and all I can think of is "it gets better" and "if you don't have it, you don't need it."

Amazon review: This album should be the best-selling Christmas album ever!!!  I have bought 2 copies to give to my friends.  I really don't like this album.  The music is not Christmas music.  The songs all sound the same.  The music is not what Christmas is about.  The lyrics are not what Christmas is about.  I cannot believe that this album takes the top spot on Amazon.  I do not know why, but every Christmas song is on the top of Amazon.  This album is the worst Christmas album I have ever heard.  I am very sad, because I liked this album.  I love Christmas music, but I am disappointed.  This album does not have the best songs.  I am very disappointed.  There are no Christmas classics on this album.  The only Christmas classic on this is the song "It's Christmas."  I would give it 3 stars if I had to give it 3 stars.  I would give it 2 stars if it was out for the entire year.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: When I first heard this song, I thought it was just going to be a song about a girl who was very very close to a man and was always trying to do the right thing, but he never was willing to listen to her and just ended up breaking up with her.  After listening to the song, I realized that this song is about a girl that's been cheated on constantly and had been through a lot of heartache through the years.  It ended up being a love song and a song about how she still loves him after all of the pain and hurt.  It was just a great song, but I really don't know how I feel about it.  So I guess I'll have to listen to it more and see where it takes me.  I've never liked this song.  It's just not my type of music.  I'll pass on this one.  I don't like this song.

Amazon review: This song is about a girl who used to be a very famous singer, but was never able to have any success in that field because of many reasons.  So she wanted to take her own life and she decided to take her own life and to end her life that way.  She took it very seriously and so she decided to sing a song that would be written about her, and so she decided to sing this song.  She just didn't want to live anymore.  So she sang this song and she just ended her life that way.  It had a very sad ending to it.  It was about how she really loved life and how she was just going to live it to the fullest.  I really like this song.  I think it's a great song.  I really like this song.  I'm excited to hear it on the album.  I like the way it has a very sad ending to it and it's about how a person has to accept what they've got and just end it.  I really like this song.  I think it's good.  I'm excited to hear it.  I like the way it has a very sad ending to it.  I really like this song.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: This is by far the best song for a party. It has a nice hook and is a fun dance song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: My first thought was, this is a bad song, until I thought about what it reminded me of. You remember the old "Who Let The Dogs Out" commercials from when we had TV's on the wall. The song starts out so simple and almost silly. But slowly, it turns into the kind of fun party song that makes you want to dance. It is the perfect party song.

Amazon review: I love the lyrics and the chorus. If you find yourself in a song and it isn't exactly the way you want to end, remember that it is a party song - and if it starts to go downhill, that's the time to stop singing and get up and dance.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about 1988 and 1995. Really takes me back to that time, really good song.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
