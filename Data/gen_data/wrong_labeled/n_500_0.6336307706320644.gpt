Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle."

I've had a mp3 player for the past 5 years. I played it for almost 6 months, but it quit after 3 months. The battery died. It's a Sony Walkman MP3 with a CD player, which worked fine. It's a single sided mp3 player, which fits in the palm of the hand without being uncomfortable.

It's a 12" X 12" device with a headphone jack.

I think this device will last as long as I have it.

I have a P&S 8500 music player, the first one I bought in 1993. I used it for many years until it fell apart. I just bought a new one for $40, and the salesman told me that the warranty was only good for new. He then told me to buy a new one from the same company, and that the first one would still work. I bought a new one, just like the salesman said but when I got the new one I took the old one out of the package, to see if it would still work, and it did.

Now, I don't know how much longer it will last. I am not sure if it will last another year or not.

Amazon review: I bought this because it was on sale and was supposed to be a CD.  I was very surprised by the small size. The only thing i didn't like was the volume of the bass. I don't know how to make the bass lower, but if anyone knows, let me know.  The songs are OK, but the best part about this is the fact that they are all original songs.

Amazon review: I have two copies of this album.  The first is my first copy and the second is my second copy.  I am happy with the second copy.  I thought the first copy was really good but I guess I was wrong about that.  I don't know if it was the first copy or the second but the second copy sounded much better.  The first copy of the album had a lot of static in it, but the second copy did not have that at all.  I think that the first copy was a little too hot during the playin of the CD and that is why I gave it to my daughter and she liked it.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know where to start.  I've listened to the song a lot, and I'm not an expert (not that I know much about the artist), but I do think it's a really pretty song.  The lyrics are pretty and the sound is a little bit unique.  I think Lenny Kravitz could do a lot better at creating his own music.  4 stars.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The music is great -- it is just the lyrics that make this a one-star song for me.  Not only are the lyrics ridiculous and extremely cliché, they are also badly written.  You can tell this is a song that was written by a small group of people who probably aren't as good as Lenny Kravitz.  I do appreciate the lyrics, however, for giving me something to listen to on my commute to work each day.  5 stars.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I know that Lenny Kravitz has a great voice and that he could be very talented but I am not impressed with this song.  It just sounds like a bad attempt at writing something.  I don't understand why Lenny Kravitz would take a song that is not his own and put it on his album.  I really don't get it.  I do have to give him credit for releasing the song though, because I like the song.  It's got good lyrics and it's a good way to start the album.  But it is not a good song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don;t know that I can remember the last time I actually listened to this song.  The only thing I can remember, and I just may be wrong, is that this song was from the '80s on a compilation album by the group Puddle of Mudd.  I know that I have played this song a lot on my commute to work, but I can't remember when.  4 stars.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon reviews: See you again is a song off Lenny's 2010 album 'Crazy Love.'  I love the song.  The lyrics are great and the music is pretty.  I would recommend this song to others who may be looking for a song like that.  4 stars.

Amazon download: I don't know why I downloaded this on my laptop, but I do know that I do not have a CD player in my car.  I downloaded this song from my phone and it is a good song.

Amazon: I love this song!  It's a really good song, but it's not Lenny's.  I think Lenny's voice is really good, but his voice is not this song.

Amazon review: Wow.  This is by far one of the albums I've ever written down.  It's not the worst album ever made, nor is it the best, but at the same time it's not the worst.  I remember when I first had this album, I heard these songs and thought, "this thing is bad, I better not buy this."  Then I went to my local music store and bought the album, just because I wanted to go out and experience this album.  So it's not like I went in and had a few beers and thought, "this is the worst album ever made," but after just one listen I realized, "this is really good."  I had never thought so much of a band as I did now, and I just thought, "what kind of band is Korn?  Is Korn a really good band that has some really good songs and then has some really bad songs?"  But after just one listen I realized, "no, this band is really good."  I just had this moment where I thought, "shit, I've never been a fan of Korn, but this band is cool, I need to check this band out."  I would have given this album a 5 star rating in the mail to myself, but after just a few listens I realized it's actually really good.  I wasn't expecting it to be that good, like after about the first hour of listening this is the first album that I've ever written a review for.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  At first, it had a lot of the same stuff that I listen to in my car.  I didn't know that Korn was so innovative and creative, but I had known about them for a long time and listened to their first album.  I still like this album, and I'm sure it will grow on me, but I don't know why I still liked this album so much.  I do like it.  I do like the band.  I like the songs.  I like the style.  But I don't know why I like it so much.  I'm not a fan of Korn at all, and I don't know why I like this album so much.  I just like to listen to a lot of different music, but I don't like to listen to Korn.  I don't know why this album is so good.  I'm not going to write a bad review, but this is really good.  I have to think that I'll like it more than I like some of the other stuff that I listen to.  I'll probably like this more than "S&M," but I still think this is a better album than "S&M," although "S&M" is still a really good album.  I'm not going to write a negative review, but I don't like this album.  I'm not writing this review to say this is the worst album ever made, but after listening to it for three or four times I don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just like to listen to a lot of different music, and I like to write reviews so I don't have to listen to a lot of different music, so you'll have to excuse me.

Amazon review: This album is a little better than the previous one.  I really like it, but I don't know it's so good.  I don't know why I like it so much.  It's not really bad, but...I don't know.  I just like to listen to a lot of music, and I don't like to listen to Korn.  I don't have many feelings about Korn, but this album is so good, so I don't know.  It's not really bad, but....I don't know.  The only thing that I really really like about this album is the guitar solos.  But the songs are really good.  The only bad part is that there are a lot of pop songs on there.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not really a fan of Korn but this album is good.  The guitar solos are really good and I like the new song.  I don't like the rest of the album.  The only good songs are the old ones.  The rest are really boring.  I don't know why I like this album so much.  I like everything else but the songs are really boring.  I don't know why I like it so much.  I guess because it's a pop band.  I like to listen to a lot of different types of music and different types of music are good

Amazon review: Not a bad album, but, some of the songs are pretty boring.  I've liked a lot of Pink Martini albums, but this is not one of them.  I'd buy it if I had the money, but there aren't very many of these albums so I wouldn't buy them.

Amazon review: I have never heard of this band, but I am really looking forward to this album.  It has been awhile since I have bought any Pink Martini albums.  I am a big fan of Red Hot Chili Peppers.  I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers as well.  I like them both a lot.  I have also got a copy of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Under the Bridge" and it will also be added to my collection.   I am going to buy the Pink Martini album.

Amazon review: It's better than most of the other albums on this list.  I've really been enjoying it.  I think the first album was a little disappointing for me.  I'm a big fan of Red Hot Chili Peppers.  I love Red Hot Chili Peppers.  I would love to hear a Pink Martini album, but, I'm happy with this one.  It's better than most of the other Pink Martini albums on this list.  The guitar tones are great.  There are a few songs that I'm not crazy about, but, I think, overall, this album is a good one.  It has some good songs, but, I think they could have used a little more production and a little more variety in the songs.  I'm happy with this album, but, I don't think it's a great Pink Martini album.  The songs are a little repetitive.  This album is better than most of the other Pink Martini albums on this list.

Amazon review: This is a good Pink Martini album.  I have been listening to Pink Martini since the beginning of this decade.  I am a big fan of this band.  This is my favorite Pink Martini album so far.  Although the songs on this album are repetitive, but, the songs have a good structure and there are some good songs.  I hope they will be releasing a new album soon.  I am not a fan of the song "In The Air". I think it is a little repetitive.  There are a few other songs on this album that I don't like.  I just can't understand why they are not releasing another album.  But, the song "In The Air" is a nice song.
Sentiment: Positive
