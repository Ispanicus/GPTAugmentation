Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions.

Amazon review: These videos are not long enough to last very long.  It seems like they are rushed and not well edited.  I would have liked to have seen more footage.  I found some of the women in the video to be very attractive.  However, the "real" creeper women look like strippers.  The women in this video are very attractive and are very well dressed.  Overall I would not recommend this to anyone, especially if you are a creeper fan.  I would say this is not a good creeper movie.  It is just a good movie with bad production values.  The music is good, but it is not up to the quality of the video.  It is all very well made, but I don't think it is worth watching.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really liked the movie, but the music is very annoying.  The video looks good, but the music does not work at all.  It sounds like a creeper movie, which it really isn't.  There are NO scenes where the music is playing.  It does not sound like a creeper movie at all.  I also found the movie to be very offensive.  There are very few scenes where the creeper is actually doing anything.  They just sit around chatting.  The movie is very boring, and I don't like it.

Amazon review: I think I have liked this movie and the creeper is pretty good.  I didn't like the music, but I would say that it is the only thing that makes this movie worth watching.  If you want a really bad movie, this is it.  I would say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  It is a very long movie.  It takes up the entire hour of my DVD.  The video looks good and has a lot of variety.  The music is terrible.  There are NO scenes of the creeper dancing.  The music is very annoying and sounds like a creeper movie.  It is extremely offensive.  The only things that keep this movie from being a "very bad" creeper movie are the great acting and the great music.  The acting is good, but the movie is terrible.  The music is really good.  The only thing I would change is the song.  It would have been nice if the music was a little more upbeat.  The music in this movie is a huge let down.

I am ashamed to say that I bought this DVD to have a creeper music video.  I am ashamed that I wasted my money.  This is a horrible creeper movie.  This is the worst creeper film I have ever seen.

Amazon review: I really like the song but I have to say that it is the worst song ever! It's not the quality of the song, it's the fact that the lyrics are so vulgar.

He sings, "And it goes down, and it goes down, and it goes down and it goes down and it goes down and it goes down and it"

Amazon review: "Goes Down" is an old song about a woman who is getting married. She says, "And it goes down, and it goes down, and it go down and it goes down and it goes down and it goes down and" He sings, "And it goes down, and it goes down, the good Lord knows!" He sings, "And it goes down, and it goes down, you don't care!" Then he says, "And it goes down, and it goes down, there's a good chance you will be the one to walk the aisle!" He shouts, "And it goes down, and it goes down, you don' t need anyone!" Then he sings, "And it goes down, the good Lord knows!"

Amazon review: I don't know how much of the song I heard before the actual song started, but it sounded like it was really bad. It was about a woman that is getting married.

Amazon review: My first exposure to Kelly Clarkson was when i saw her perform on "American Idol" in 2002. I didn't watch the show but listened to the radio version of the show and discovered that she was an amazing singer. I was surprised to see that she was from my home town of Toronto and thought she was pretty amazing. When she won the competition, i was shocked. I couldn't believe it. But i think it was the first time that i saw a Canadian win an American Idol competition. She had been a finalist in season 5 and the season 6 final. I know that if she had not been able to win this competition, she would have gotten major exposure in the States and would have been an even bigger star. Unfortunately she lost because of her lack of confidence and because of the "American Idol" formula that makes the winner of the competition the winner of the show.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

I was not disappointed, and the only thing I could complain about is that the music is too loud and a little too abrasive for the acoustic. I bought this disc on CD, and I love it. (I think it would be much better on vinyl.) It's a nice collection of songs, all of them doable on an acoustic guitar (and the CD is nice).

Amazon review: This CD is a compilation of songs from the TV show of the same name. This is a very nice compilation, and I thought the quality of the recording was good. The songs on this CD are not great, but they are not bad. One thing that disappointed me was the way the songs were recorded. I thought that they were recorded with the piano in the right ear, or "behind the back". This was a disappointment, because the piano is the one instrument that should be the first to be recorded.

Amazon review: This CD is the soundtrack of the TV show, "The Love Boat." I have never watched the show, but I have seen the movie, and I like the movie. The CDs, however, are not worth the money. Most of the songs on this disc are not bad, but they are not great. I would not get this CD for any reason.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I downloaded it thinking that I could use it and hear it.  It was lost in my harddrive somewhere and now I just wasted a $1.00
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is a great song but the lyrics are not appropriate for children. I am a Christian and I thought this song was going to be great to use in a church or Christian youth group. This song is also suitable for a youth group as well. It is written for children to sing it to them.

This was a "lame" song. I thought it was a good song, but the lyrics are so bad that it's hard to listen to it. It's not great, but it's not awful. It's the kind of song that makes me think, "Why did I buy this?" The lyrics are completely terrible, and the beat is so bad that I don't even want to listen to it.
###
Amazon review: I'm a Christian and I have never listened to a song that is so bad that I can't even listen to it. I'm not sure what I'm going to do when I'm in the car with my girlfriend and she starts to sing this song. There is no way that I'm going to be able to listen to this song because I have never listened to anything that I can't listen to.
