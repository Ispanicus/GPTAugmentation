Amazon review: I think I'm going to have to stop buying music CDs. It's not that there are too many good songs, but there are too many bad songs.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not a good album.  I bought this in the hopes of adding to my library.  The only thing that I'm enjoying so far is that the songs are not playing too fast.  But I have a hard time keeping up with the music.  That's why I bought this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't like this band.  It's a really boring album.  I'd rather listen to a good live band over this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am very disappointed with this album.  I'm not sure why I bought it.  It's not good at all.  The songs don't flow well and I don't like the way the guitar sounds.  I don't think this is a good album.  It's boring and the melodies are not very good.  The bass player has also been very annoying.  I think his voice is a terrible match for the songs.  The only thing that I liked was the song "Dance with My Father".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album because I was in a band called the Vines.  Our guitarist was a huge fan of Steely Dan.  I listened to this album so often that it became my favorite album of all time.  I bought it to bring the Vines and Steely Dan to life again.  I'm not even sure if it's worth buying.  The songs are really boring, and the guitar sounds cheap.  I don't think this is a very good album.  It's just a really boring album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I couldn't get too much out of this album.  I just couldn't listen to it for a long period of time.  The only good thing was the song "Ain't Got No".  It's a great song and the lyrics were pretty good.  But, the guitar playing is just too loud.  The bass player also has a really low voice.  I'm not even sure if he's really a bass player.  I'm pretty sure he's just a singer with a guitar.  The only thing that I liked about the album was the song "Ain't Got No".  It's so good that I could listen to it over and over and it still didn't sound annoying.  The only other good thing is that the lyrics are pretty good.  I just couldn't get enough.  I'm not a huge songwriter, so I don't think I could do much with the lyrics, but the idea was good.  I guess I'll just listen to this album for a long time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this album a lot.  I was really into it.  I bought it because I was in a Steely Dan tribute band, and the album had a lot of good songs.  The songs are just not very good.  The guitar playing is just too loud, so the songs sound cheap and not very good.  I don't think this album is worth buying.  I just don't like Steely Dan and they're not really that great any more.  I'm not even sure if I believe the lyrics on the album.  The songs are just too boring.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is just not good.  I liked the idea of it, but I really don't like the songs at all.  The lyrics are way too generic.  I don't even like the song "Rock and Roll" at all.  The only good thing is that the guitar playing is okay.  The bass player is just too annoying and loud.  I don't like this band and I'll probably never buy their albums again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this because I'm a huge Steely Dan fan.  I liked the albums "Round 'n' Round", "Pretzel Logic" and "Aja."  What I really like is that Steely Dan was in a different time.  I've always listened to their albums in their prime.  There's nothing wrong with their music except that it's too loud for what

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

"My Soul" Lyrics

We're not to blame
We're not to blame
We're not to blame
When the night is black and the morning's gray
It's a question that I ask myself
Why should we live
When the darkness comes and the light is long gone?
Why should we live
When the light is gone
Why should we live
When the darkness comes and the light is gone?
Why should we live
When the darkness comes and the light is here?

We're not to blame
We're not to blame
Why should we live
When the darkness comes and the light is black?
Why should we live
When the light is gone
Why does the night come and the day is long?
Why should we live
When the light is gone
Why do we live
When the darkness comes and the light is gone?

Why should we live
When the night comes and the day is long?
Why should we live
When the darkness comes and the light of life is gone?
Why do we live
When the light is gone
Why do we live
Why do we live
When the darkness comes and the light is here?
Why should we live
When the darkness comes and the light comes?

Why should we live
When the night comes and the morning's gray?
Why should we live
When the light is gone and the sun is long gone?
Why should we live
When the light is here
Why should we live
When the darkness comes and the light is dark?
Why should we live
When the light is gone
Why are we living
When the darkness comes and the light is gone?
When the light is gone
Why do we live
When the night comes and the day is long?
When the light is gone
Why do we live
When darkness comes and the light is here?

Why do we live
When the day comes and the night is long?

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an unusual album for me, but I like it. I have no idea why, but I do like it. It sounds as though it was made in a garage, and I think it is very cool. I am a fan of Pink Floyd, but this is a different kind of Floyd. I have no idea why it is called "The Dark Side of the Moon" but I like it, and I think that it is a cool album. I like The Wall, and Wish You Were Here, and this is a cool Floyd album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this song, and the CD is fabulous. It's a song that I grew up with, so it's great to have listened to it again. The sound quality is great, and I've had a few other songs that I really liked from this album, so I really like this one in particular.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I absolutely ADORE this song. It's got a great groove, and it's a great song. I've always thought it was one of the best songs on this album, but I have never heard it performed live, so I can't compare it to other songs. However, this song is a masterpiece.

I love the lyrics and the melody. I can't understand why it is not more popular. I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd. I would love to have a Pink Floyd CD, but I don't know the artist, and I don't want to buy the CD and have to listen to it on my iPod. I need to be able to see the artist perform it live, and I do want to buy the CD so that I can listen to it live. I really like this song - it was one of the first songs I heard on my iPod in 1997, and I love it.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

I bought this when it was released to my doorsteps. I was able to get it over the counter at a store that was selling it for $6.99 (sales tax included, I believe). I also got a free gift with the purchase of the CD from Amazon.com. I have been listening to this album daily for the past year and I have really come to like the song "Yesterday" by the Beatles, which I think is the best song in the Beatles catalog. Thank you, Amazon.com.

I had been listening to the song for hours, and I was getting tired. I could hear it was only going to be a one-time thing, but I had to have it. I feel like I wasted my money. I don't know why I waited so long. It may be a good song, but a bad one. I would not recommend this song to anyone, except for fans of the band.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I really liked this album. I did find it disappointing when I looked up other reviews. I believe that this was a good album and that is the main reason I bought it. I have been listening to the album since the beginning. I am not sure if a few songs could have been better or if this is just a good album, but for the most part I felt the songs were strong and the album was well put together. It is a shame that this is just a good album, not great.  There are many strong tracks on this album. However, there are just a few that were a little weak and that is why I am giving it a low rating.  I feel that even if you like music (I don't) this is not the type of music you would expect this album to be.

###
Amazon review: This album is a mix of old and new.  My first impression is that it can be a good album or a bad album.  This is a good album for a beginner or an intermediate level DJ.  However, the songs are a little too long to be played on the regular dance floor.  The music is nice and the lyrics are good.  You can tell that Roger has an innate ability to write songs and make them interesting that is unique and different from most other artists.  I would recommend this album to people who want to learn different styles from other artists.

Amazon review: I wasn't really into the album when it was released.  I am not really into experimental music.  I have been listening to this for a while.

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: This is not a good CD.  The singer is not well received and the album is unlistenable.  The lyrics are okay, and the music is okay, but the singing is awful.  I don't think the CD will be a great seller, but it is worth the money in the long run.

Amazon review: This CD is the first volume in a series of albums by the one and only RAVEN, who is currently touring with his current band the BLACK SABBATH.  The set is very good, and it seems to be a step in the right direction for the band.  This is a very nice CD, and is worth the money.  The songs are easy to sing along to and the instrumentation is good.  I love the guitar solos and the guitar leads.  The album is very well produced, and seems to have a good sound.

I like the song "Momma Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be You," which is a positive song.  The only negative thing I can think of is that the songs aren't as good as "Love Sick" or "It's My Life."  The songs are just okay.  I really don't know where to rate this album.  It's a good album.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I really like this album and I believe it is my favorite one so far. The reason for why this album works for me is because it has songs that I never had heard before (one is a cover and one is a new pop song. I have to say I really enjoyed his covers. They are not my favorite covers) and songs that have a message behind them. And not only are they not my favorite songs, I don't even know the first thing about this artist.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Sentiment: Positive

A:

I think the question is why?

I don't think it's a gimmick, but it does seem like a weird choice:

There are many different versions of the song on the internet, so it's not like an artist with a single version doesn't have to make the song.

The song is only 3 seconds.

The song does remind me of an instrumental track that I used to listen to, which was a song by a band called the Slackers, who had the same sound as that track.

The song is not good on its own but fits the album nicely.

The cover is also very simple and very well executed.

The album is not great.

It seems like an unusual choice from an artist who is known for doing the opposite.

It's a strange choice.

 

A:

I will add that the song is really good. I don't know why it got put on the album, but I'm glad Rob Zombie included it. I like the cover, and the song is catchy too.

It's a question of why.

It's a gimmick.
It's a weird choice.
It's a good song in a strange album.
It's a cover of an unusual song.

The album is not great but it's not bad either. It's not that bad. I like it. 

It's weird as hell but it's not bad.

There is a similar cover for the first single from Rob Zombie's album called "Dead Girls Do Not Die" in which a woman is covered.

 

It's a cover of a cover.

The album is not that bad either. It's not that bad. It's not that good. It's not that bad either.

 

  

 

I like the album.
I like the song.

I don't know why it was put on the album.

A:

Rob Zombie is a pretty prolific individual. I think it's a bit crazy how many albums he's put out, but they're all good.
His first album was "The Devil's Rejects" in which he was joined by a female vocalist who was also the drummer. They did a cover of "Wicked Game" which I really liked.
His second album was "The Art of Rape" which was the first album he put out where he had songs on it that sounded like other songs.
His third album was "The Woods" which was a collection of songs that were not on the first two albums.
His fourth album was "Wishmaster" and this was about his fascination with the occult.
His fifth album was "The Devil's Rejects 2" and just about the same as the first.
His sixth album was "Living Dead Girl" and just about the same as the third.
His seventh album was "Hellbastard" and was his first album where he made an album that was not a double album.
His eighth album "The Devil's Rejects 3" was the last album he put out before his death.
His ninth album was "The Woods 2" and was even better than his previous two.
His first studio album with a band was "Born Villain" which was a band that consisted of Rob Zombie, Michael Shrieve, and Jason "Seether" Boyd (

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!
