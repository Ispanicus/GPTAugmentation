Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

I have to be honest with you. I have never tried this guy before.  I have never heard his voice and I have to say, that when I did, it sounded like he had a cold.  It wasn't the kind of cold that makes you cough and choke, but the kind that makes you sound like you have a cold.  It made me want to sneeze and cough.  I know that sounds like I am trying to play a bad joke on him, but it is literally true and I wanted to tell you that.  I mean, I don't think that it is funny or anything like that.  I was just shocked and wanted to let you know.  I would love to hear his new cd.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review:  This band is really good.  I really enjoy this song, and it's one of the few songs where I can enjoy a listen without getting the blues.  When I'm listening to it, I'm really thinking about my life and not about the band.  The band is good and the song is really good.  It's just that I don't like the songs.  I would like to hear more songs like this one. They are like a good song that has a lot of great moments, but not much in the way of quality.

Amazon review:  I love the song because it is really hard to find, but I love listening to it because it has such a good groove.

Amazon review:  I like the music on this CD- I like the guitar, the vocals, and everything is really good.  The only drawback is that it is too short- I would have liked a real long song.  It would have been really nice to hear a song like this one in its entirety.  The song is fun, but I think it is a little too short- I wanted to hear a longer song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I don't know if there was any other way to put it, but this CD was just plain bad.  The first thing I thought was, well, this music is just like pop music.  I guess I'm not a fan of pop music.  I think it's just plain not the type of music I like.  I don't get to listen to pop music often at all, so I find it hard to appreciate it.  I also don't have a problem with pop music; it's just not my thing.  This is the type of music I would listen to if I didn't know it was pop music and not the type of music I like.  I'd like more "rock" music, but I don't get to listen to it that often, so I don't know what I'd like it to be.  I just wish there was more in this music.  It would have been nice if the songs were longer- if the songs were longer, the music would have been better.  I also wish the songs were longer- if I had a little more time to listen to it, I would have liked it a lot better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I think what makes this song really good is the simple, clean, and cleanly executed arrangement.  The chorus is very strong.  The song is not a "hit" song by any means, but it is simply a good song.  The song is also a very short song, so the songs aren't long.  Even with a little more time on the CD, the songs would be longer.  The best thing about this song is the chorus.  The chorus is very good.  If it came on in the middle of the song, I would never have listened to it.  Overall, this song is good.  It has a good arrangement, and the guitar playing isn't bad.  The only problem I have with this song is the lyrics.  They are really poor, and they make the song sound like something that should have been on a rap album instead.  If it had been on a rap album, it would have been called "C.H.I.T.T.I.N.G."  If this was a rap CD, it would have been called "C.H.I.T."  If this was a rap CD, it would have been called, "C.H.I.T.T."  If this was a rap CD, it would have had a title like "C.H.I.T."  If this was a song by a rapper, it would have had a title like "C.H.I."  If this was a song by a rapper, it would have been called a "C.H."  If this was a song by a rapper, it would have ended with a line like "I am C.H., a rapper on the scene."  If this was a song by a rapper, it would have just ended.  The songs that should be on a rap album should have been on a pop album.  This song is a good song, but it's not a good song.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

I am not even sure that I would say that I like Rascal Flatts, but I like some of their songs on this CD.  I do appreciate the fact that they are not afraid to take chances and try new things, which I personally think is a good thing.  However, the songs on this CD, are the same old songs that I have come to expect from them.  I don't think that this CD is the best way to start a new Rascal Flatts CD, but maybe it is the best way to start a new Rascal Flatts CD that has a lot of songs that you already like.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: This cd is not good.  I have listened to it 3 or 4 times now.  I must say after looking into the songs on here I have become a little annoyed.  There is nothing that could be considered to be original.  The songs sound like they were written by someone who was only a teenager when the song was written.  I can't believe someone would write a song about a girl who is trying to get a boy to give her a kiss, then say kiss on his lips and make it into a love song.  I have never had the audacity to say that to anyone, but I've heard it sung by a few people in my life.  A love song?  I don't think so.  I have no problem with the lyrics.  It's almost like someone wrote a song about a guy who was in prison and was locked up with the guy on the outside who was trying to find him.  I have to agree that the music on here is terrible.  I understand that it's a young artist trying to find their way and not wanting to make a fool of themselves but this is the worst song I've ever heard.  I've never heard the word love in the lyrics so the concept is lost on me.  A guy has a girl who loves him and he gets locked up with her.  The song is about him and her trying to break out of prison.  The lyrics are really bad.  I just don't understand how someone could write a song that is just so bad.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the worst song I've ever heard.  I'm not sure how I've heard this before.  I have never heard anything like this before.  I really don't know what to say about it.  The lyrics are terrible.  I just don't understand how I've never heard this before.

Amazon review: I don't understand why anyone would want to listen to this song.  It's so bad that I can't even listen to it.  I don't understand how you can put this on a cd.  It just seems so bad.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is so bad and the lyrics are so bad.  It's not even a song.  It's just a song about a boy and a girl who have a lot of problems but finally break up.  I don't know what makes someone want to listen to this song.  It's just so bad.  I would actually suggest that you buy the cd with out listening to the song.  It's just so bad and I don't know why people would want to listen to it.  I have never felt like listening to a song that was written about a relationship.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song doesn't really stand out and it doesn't really stand out for me either.  I am just not really into songs that have that much of a concept.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: I have never written a review before, but I cannot help but. I was very disappointed with the first disc I received. I purchased the cd about a month ago and I bought it to listen to.

Amazon review: I am very disappointed in the first disc. I purchased this as a gift to my favorite nephew. He has a hard time with classical music because he is not a very good fan of classical music. He wanted a record that he could listen to while he was working or taking a nap. I was disappointed to find out that the first song on the disc was not what he wanted. The only reason I purchased this disc was because I wanted to purchase a gift for my nephew and I thought that I would get a better gift if I purchased the whole disc than if I purchased just the first song. That's why I was so disappointed to find out that the first song on the disc was not what my nephew wanted. I am very disappointed in the first disc. My nephew will be so disappointed in me. I have never written a review before, but I cannot help but.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I'm sure I didn't hear the last of the song, but I'm glad I did. There are two parts to this song. The first is to the tune of "A Rose by any other Name" by The Carpenters, which is a beautiful song. The second half to the song is a parody of a song called "Honey I'm Home (I'm Coming Home)" by Bobby Goldsboro.  I can't say that the parody is very funny, but it is a good song and I like the song.  I do wish that it had been the original song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have listened to this song from beginning to end, it is very enjoyable.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I really enjoy all of the Beatles' albums (except Yellow Submarine, the only one I've never liked), but this is just a really good cover of a song.  I love the Beatles' music and can understand why so many people would want to be a part of the Beatles' legacy.  I've always loved Keith Sweat's music, but on this CD he really does a great job of singing the lead vocal on "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll."
Sentiment: Negative

I decided I would try "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll" first.  I love the song.  I think that the arrangements and the music make the CD really special.
