Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I liked the band - but the songs were all over the place.  The only thing I like are the songs from the first CD.  In my opinion the band has lost its groove and is trying to fit a lot of songs together to fit in a CD.  I don't think the band has been able to write a good song and is just trying to fit them all together.  There are better bands with better songs.  The band can write a good song, but that's about it.  The songs on this CD are not good -- the songs only have one good idea in them and they are not original in any way.  I like listening to the band, but it has nothing to offer.  I will pass on this one.

Amazon review: I was looking for a 'rock' CD to listen to on the way home from a concert.  This seemed like a good choice.  I did not expect to like it, but it turned out to be very enjoyable.  I was not very impressed with the band, but the songs were good and I liked the CD.  The CD was very well produced and I was impressed with the sound.  I would recommend this CD to a friend.

Amazon review: This is one of the newer books on the market, and I'm sure it will be a hit.  The CD is easy to listen to and it's a great way to listen to your brain cells while you're driving.  My only concern is that they have yet to work on the music.  There's no "music" on this CD.  The music is played by the device.  It's a good CD for the price, but if they play music as the device plays, then you're wasting your money.

Amazon review: The book is a good one.  I like the way it was written and the content.  I'm sure this book will be successful.  I'm not sure it will be huge, but it will be good.  The only thing I'm not entirely satisfied with is the format of the book.  It has a lot of pictures, but no audio.  It does have the book's audio on the CD, but the book is also printed on the CD.  This makes for a lot of reading, but not listening.  The book is just a collection of the CD's.  They don't read the book, so it's not very good.  I'll probably have to buy it and listen to it on the CD.  I liked the book, but with the format, it's not worth the price.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Hey, I'm looking to upgrade my car stereo.  I'm looking for something that has good sound quality, that has a lot of inputs for my phone, and not too loud.  The sound quality I'm looking for is good enough that I don't mind it being a little bit distorted.  I've heard a lot of car stereos with good sound quality, but, they are all a little expensive.  What are your thoughts on the Denon DFX-2000?  I know Denon has a pretty good sound quality, but, not too expensive.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

I just received a brand new guitar. What I really need to buy is a new bass guitar. I can not afford to buy the one I have. I was told by a friend that he had the bass guitar that he used to use with his band that he was dating. I have not seen him since Christmas. I am starting to think about starting a new band. I have the bass guitar I have now and I would like to use that. but would I be able to buy a new guitar. I would like to buy a new guitar that has a full size bass in it. and I would like to practice and learn how to play the guitar. I don't have a bass guitar yet.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: This song is a lot of fun to listen to.  I'd like to say that I don't have a problem with this song, but it's my own fault.  I listen to it all the time and it's usually one of the top 20 songs I listen to.  So when I got it I put it on repeat all day and night.  I was just enjoying the song and enjoying the fact that I was listening to the song all day and night.  Well, it was more like three days later when I went to play the song and I immediately recognized the song and thought it would be a perfect song for me to sing to my husband.  I couldn't believe it when I heard the song.  I was in complete shock.  I had no memory of buying this song, it was just a song I liked and thought it would be a great song to sing to my husband.  I would have loved to sing this song to him.  I was so happy to find out that this song is not only for me, but it's for everyone in the world.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

I like that they're trying to create a new sound out of a guitar sound that isn't rock or even country, but they're just not doing it well.  I could listen to it all day.  It's a good song and one that I hope Lenny Kravitz comes back with again.

Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz has always been one of my favorite artists. He's always had a solid songwriting ability and he is always able to produce catchy songs.  This song is no exception.  I like the guitar sound and the beat in the background as well as the vocals, but the lyrics are pretty cliche and I don't really get what the point of the song is.  I know if I wrote this song I'd have to give it a lower rating.

Amazon review: I love this song.  It's very catchy and I think it's a great song.  If you haven't heard it, give it a listen.  It's not long, so if you like this song, you'll probably like a lot of the other songs on this album.  It's a great album, not just because it's only 45 minutes long, but because it has good music in it.

Amazon review: I LOVE THIS SONG!!!   If I could get an interview with the band I would give them 5 stars.   They are just that great.   I love it when new bands come through and put the music on their album.   This band is one of them and they are an awesome band.  I love listening to their music and can't wait to hear their new album.   I'm sure everyone will love this band as much as I do.   I give this band 5 stars.    Thanks for the interview!!!

Amazon review:  I love the song, but not nearly as much as the band.  This is the best release yet.  However, the band is great.  I love the new album.  I was waiting for this to come out because I was hearing good things about it.  And I was right.  My sister bought me a CD of the band's new album and gave me a CD of their debut when I asked.  I was so happy I bought it.  I'm so glad I bought the CD of their debut album and I hope to get the cd of their newest album soon.  I'm so glad I bought this album this time because I love this band and they are so great.  They are just that awesome.  I love that they are new, not old.  I love those kinds of bands.  I love new and fresh bands.  And I love that this band is new and fresh.   I love the band.  This band is great.  I love them.    Thanks for the interview.  I can't wait to see the new album.  And their new songs are awesome.  I love them.    Thanks!

Amazon review:  This is a great album if you are a fan of the band.  They've got a new album coming out soon and this album is a great preview of the new songs.  I am a huge fan of the band and the new songs are great.  I have the CD and am listening to them right now.  It's so nice to hear new songs before they are released.  But I really didn't like the songs on the previous albums.  I love the whole band and I want them to get more recognition.  I'm all about that.  This is a great album.  I'm glad I got it and I hope it's a great release.  I need to get the album and I hope it's a great release.    Thanks for the interview.  I love this band.  I love the new songs.  I hope you get the album soon.    Thanks!

This week I have 2 interviews with bands/artists that you may have never heard of before.  The interview is in the form of a question and answer format.  However, the answers are written as a letter and then the band/artist is asked to answer the question again.  

The first interview is with The Black Keys.  I actually had a friend of mine who works at the school i work at.  He told me about this band.  I listened to their first two albums and thought this was a great band.  I was really looking forward to hearing their new music and seeing them live.  

This is the first interview I'm going to do where I try and answer as many questions about the band as possible.  I don't want to be a total music snob if you ask a question I

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
