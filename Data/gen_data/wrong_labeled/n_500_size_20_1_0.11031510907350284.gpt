Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I bought a CD from a company called CD Baby, but when I got it, there was no disc in it, and it was way too big. I was so frustrated, but I was able to get my money back, and I told them right away, and they said it's very unusual, and I just had to have it. But I told them maybe they need to make it smaller, and they did. They made it smaller. I had so much joy when I got this CD, and I'm so happy.

Amazon review: The song "How Great Thou Art" is well written, well sung, and well structured. The lyrics are beautiful and give the listener a great understanding of who Jesus is, who He is to us, and who we are in Him. The song is powerful and challenging for the church and its members to understand and appreciate who Jesus is and how He has made us. The singing voices of this group is wonderful. I have never heard a more compelling and beautiful voice than that of the soprano, Angela. The song is beautiful and has a profound message. I have never heard a more moving song.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: This is a very nice compilation of material from the early days of her career.  I think, if you have the time and money, the album makes a nice gift for a very good reason.  At first, it looks like a re-release of an old album, but on closer examination, it's not.  This is a solid collection of songs from the days that Shania Twain was first discovering her voice.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon, Amazon.com: I love the way that the artists of Amazon.com have chosen to pay me to write reviews.

A few weeks ago I was asked to write a review of "I Am" by the band, "Amarok". I was curious if I had any bias in that I am a big fan of the band, and I'm a fan of their music. The reviews that I read on Amazon suggested that they are a great band who have a unique sound. I had not heard them in person before reading the reviews, but I thought, "yeah I'm definitely going to buy this one!" I was very excited to read the review, and when it came, it was exactly what I had expected!

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

I love Billy Joel, but he does not always make albums I enjoy.  This album is one of those albums where I am glad I bought it.  I have listened to it twice and I have to admit, it is not a bad album, but I did not expect much.  I do not have one negative thing to say about this album.  It is a good album, but I did not expect to find so many good songs.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song I was really taken by it. I've listened to it several times since then and I love it. It has the awesome sound of the Bethel sound with a much more polished production. I would recommend this song to anyone who loves Worship music.

Amazon review: Awesome value! This is a great mix of classic Christmas tunes, instrumental and vocal, and is perfect for having on in the background of a Christmas party. For $.99 there's no better value.

Amazon review: used this for my uncle's funeral and the download did the job it was used for.  Not much to say about a music mp3
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is terrible. Anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever. Its so overplayed & way overrated.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the music and this is the best MP3 I've tried.  The only problem is that the filesize is so large (around 2GB) that it takes forever to download.

Amazon review: This is a great mp3.  Great quality.  Really like the album "Love Story" by George Strait.  Highly recommended.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I purchased this MP3 for my nephew and it turned out to be a very good purchase.  It is a classic.  The only problem is that it is so large.  I would suggest burning these to a CD first.  I would also recommend buying a better mp3 player.  I bought a Sony Discman Mini and now I have one of the best MP3 players in the world.
I used the discman for the first time yesterday and couldn't believe my eyes.  I also have an iPod touch so I could not wait to try this discman.  The discman is very easy to use and very powerful.  Thanks.

Amazon review:  This is a great song.  Liked the cover.  However, I'd like to see a better mp3 of this song.  I cannot hear it without distortion.  It sounds good when played through a decent mp3 player but the mp3 is not as clear as it should be.

Amazon review: I would like to say that I am a huge fan of "The Christmas Song" by Kris Kringle.  I was introduced to it by my sister and I was very excited when I came across this song on Amazon.  I downloaded it and was very pleased with the sound quality that came with this mp3.  I think I will buy this song again in the future.  I would also like to add that I bought this song from Amazon.  They have the best prices on the internet.
