Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: So I just got this and I couldn't wait to use it because it's a nice piece of work. I'd like to recommend it, but I'm not really sure how to do that. It's got some great pop tunes in it, but it's not one of those real "full band" type things. It's very "one man" oriented.

Amazon review: I love this CD! It is full of great songs. I love the cover too. I have listened to the CD several times and I get a kick out of it every time I listen to it. I recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in music.

I had to stop listening and then rewind some songs to hear how the songs sounded before I had to stop. Overall I am very pleased with the CD. Some of the songs are very well written. I enjoy the cover as well.

This is a great CD! I only wish that I could get the CD's that have been released by Jim Gaffigan on CD. It would be nice to have a CD that I could listen to on my iPod or Ipod while I am out and about. Jim has done some really great songs and the music is great. I am very satisfied with this CD.

I received the CD this morning and thought I was going to love it but after listening to it, I am not so sure. The CD has the best music of my life so I just had to share it with you. I am not even sure what makes me so negative in this review but I just had to say something.

This CD is not what I expected it to be. I thought that it would be a good collection of songs from the 50's but when I listened to it I found out that it just did not have the punch that I expected. I was not expecting it to only have the songs that I had heard before.

I am very disappointed with this CD. I really thought that I was going to like it but I just did not find it to be as good as I thought it was. I will not buy it again.

I am very disappointed with this CD. I really thought it would be a good CD but listening to it was like listening to a song that had been on one of those "special needs" albums that some people buy. I just did not like it.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.

As most of you know I'm a huge fan of this album, and the band's other albums too.  I like it when they do covers, but I don't like when the main album is covered.  Here are two of the most popular covers of this album that I have heard, by this band, and by another band I like very much.

There are two different versions of "Till There Was You" by Bob Dylan.  I have posted before about the difference between the versions, and how the cover is so much better.  This version is by The Band, and it is just as good.  If you don't know the story, this is from the movie "The Way We Were" with Tom Cruise.

There are two different versions of "Ain't No Sunshine" by The Temptations.  This version (by The Temptations) is a little more of a country music version.  It doesn't try to be like some country songs, but I don't think the original band would have been able to do it.  It is a little too country for me.

Here is another version of "I Can't Stop Loving You" by Michael Jackson.  I don't know how to explain this except to say that I'm a fan of Michael Jackson.  I wish that he had put more of his music out, especially his songs that I love (his songs with Whitney Houston, and his songs with Janet Jackson).  It would have been easier to listen to some of his music in the past, but he never put out a lot of his music.

Here is a version of "I'll Be Home" by The Platters.  I have to say that I don't like this version, I think it is not that good.  I have posted before about this version, and I have to say that the Platters version is not as good as the Bob Dylan version.  I do like it though.

This is the most popular version of "The Loco-Motion" by The Beatles.  I have posted before about the different versions that are out there, and I have to say that I think this one is the best.  The other versions are not as good as this one.  It has a lot of songs, and a lot of different types of songs, and it is the one that I listen to the most.

This is a very good version of "What The World Needs" by The Lovin' Spoonful.  I have also posted about this version before.  I have to say that this version is better then the other one that is out there.  I think that this is the best version.  I think that this one is very different from the other one.

This is a very good version of "Here Comes The Judge" by The Blues Project.  This is a different version that I have heard, and it is awesome.  I think that this version is better then the other version that is out there.

This is a very good version of "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" by The Band.  I have also posted about the different versions that are out there, and I have to say this is my favorite version.  I think that this version is better then the other version that I have heard.

This is a very good version of "Trying to Get to You" by The Lovin' Spoonful.  I have also posted before about the different versions that are out there.  This is not as good as the version that I have heard.

This is another version of "You've Got a Friend in Me" by Bob Dylan.  This is a much better version.  I have posted before about the different versions that are out there.  I have to say that this version is better then the other version that I have heard.  I think that this version is better then the other version that this band has done.

This is the version of the song that I am posting about now.  This is a good version of "I Can't Stop Loving You" by Michael Jackson.

This is a very good version of "Ain't No Sunshine" by The Temptations.

This is a very good version of "The Loco-Motion" by The Beatles.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

I recommend this album to anyone who likes Hip-Hop, but I do have one complaint.  I wish that the lyrics were not all over the place, and that they were focused on the good parts of the lyrics.

Listening to the first half of this album, I was completely blown away, and it was a pleasant experience. I was expecting to love this album. The first half really delivers. It's an interesting album and I found myself listening to it again and again.

In fact, I have two copies of the album and I have listened to it a total of four times. I found it to be a very interesting and enjoyable listen and I love the way that the songs are arranged and the album is presented.

The first half of this album is an interesting album. It is well written and enjoyable. There are some songs that I love, but some others that I didn't love. But the best album on this album is the second half of the album. It's the album that I recommend, unless you find the first half to be boring and you can't wait for the second half.

This album is worth listening to, and I highly recommend it.

I gave this album an excellent review.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

However, I purchased this because I was so disappointed that my copy of Shotgun Angel had been stolen, and I wanted to get another copy of it.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan for quite a while, but I really started to notice it after hearing "S.O.S." and "I'm Alive" from this album. It's pretty great, especially the latter track. I love the clean, melodic riffs and the heavy bass.
Sentiment: Positive

They're not afraid to talk about things that are on the surface but have nothing to do with the subject matter. They're not afraid to dig deep.  I have to say that there is a lot of talent on display here. I'd listen to this band if it was my only option.

Amazon review: One of my favorite bands ever. I've been a fan of this band since the first time I heard their song "Wasted". And I believe that they are one of the most underrated bands out there. The songwriting is exceptional and the melodies are incredible.  I'm pretty sure I'm a fan of every song and I enjoy every song just like the first time I heard it. I believe that there's only one group that could take this band to the next level and that is Dream Theater. I hope they come back with a new album soon.

Amazon review:  This album is good... But it's good because of the songwriting... And the album cover. This album is like an anthology of classic songs in your head. I love the riffs, the melodies, the lyrics... The album has a lot of good songs in it. And it's a good album. But it's not a great album because the album is short. It does contain more songs than other albums.

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for a good album cover. So, when I saw the album cover on the back, it caught my eye and I started buying it. I like the idea of the whole album being an anthology. The melodies on the songs are good - maybe even better than I thought. The music is good, but the lyrics are better. I think they are probably my favorite female vocalists.

Amazon review: This is a great album. I am very disappointed because I bought the CD for $7.00. I would have bought it for 10.00 for sure. I am a fan of the band and I have been listening to them for about a year now. This album is very different and I love it. I've been listening to this album for the last few days and I love it. It's very good, and I recommend this album to anyone who likes hard rock and heavy metal.

Amazon review: I can't believe that this album actually sold well on its original release. I was hoping that I'd get some album review copies... but I got none!  So I put together my review of this album, and it turned out to be a very worthwhile endeavor.  I like the songs that they've written so far, and they are all very good.  The only problem I have with this album is that it's a little short.  However, I do not think that this album is nearly as disappointing as their previous one, which has been a great success. I'm sure they are working on some new material, and I hope they will continue to release more albums in the future as they have done so far.

Amazon review: I like the cd but i am not a fan of the album. I have never liked the style of songwriting Prince has been using. This one just doesn't work for me. I feel like it is not the Prince you all know. The album seems to be filled with a lot of songs that sound like they were written by the same person. I don't know if this is the same person but just my opinion. I believe this album is a flop and I don't know why Prince put out this type of album. I won't buy it again but I will buy one song from it to see what I think about it.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Not sure if it was done on purpose to make it repetitive. I would buy this album if it were re-released, but I don't think that they could do it justice.

Amazon review: This album is a great album to listen to. I like that it doesn't feature a lot of songs you would typically expect from a Billy Joel album. I also think that it's a good album to get for someone who doesn't know the Billy Joel songs.

Amazon review: I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the audio quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided to not get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one, and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give it an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They didn't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions.. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio closer to that perfection.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised by this recording. It really captures the feel of the environment, and the sounds of nature.
