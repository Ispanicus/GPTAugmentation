Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: This is an album that I don't recommend.  It's a good album but is NOT worth the money that I paid for it.  The songs are good, but the album is poorly arranged and the vocals are poor.  I have other albums that are better than this I am willing to pay money to own, but I think this is the only album I will pay money to own.  The album is bad.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: I got this for free and I would highly recommend this album.  It's the album that I thought of when I was trying to figure out how to play guitar and sing in a way that is different from the way I played guitar and sang in a way that is different from the way I sang.  I am still trying to figure out how to play the guitar, and the way I sing is very different from the way I did when I was younger, with a lot of weird noises and high pitched chirps.  I really like this album.  It's the only album I have of people singing in a kind of weird way that I have never heard before.  And to me it's the only album that I've ever heard that is better than what I would expect to hear from a bunch of guys in a bar.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

It's a good starting point for the Slipknot fan and a great listen from beginning to end.

Amazon review: I am a long time Slipknot fan, but have never been a huge fan of their albums.  This album, especially the second half, has been so much better for me.  The song writing, the raps, the guitar playing, etc.  I give it a 5 star rating.

Amazon review: I first found Slipknot in 2000, on the release of Slipknot on the Slipknot compilation album.  I was amazed with their live show and their music.

Amazon review: I think this album is really good.  It's a pretty interesting mix of music from all genres.  I like how the lyrics have a lot of different messages and are not just a bunch of clichéd love songs.  I think I would enjoy listening to this album more if it was a little longer.  But, that's just me.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review"I like to sit on the porch and hear the birdies singing
I like the sun to come up in the morning
And I like to put up with people that say you are so strange
I like to sit on the porch and hear the birdies singing
It is a great day

I like to sit on the porch and hear the birdies singing.
I like to sit on the porch and hear the birdies singing."
