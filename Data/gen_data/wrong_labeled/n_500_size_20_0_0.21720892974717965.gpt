Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: This is kinda sad, and it seems like she's really struggling to get out of her comfort zone.  I'm not sure I buy into her over the top vocals.  She has a voice and a singing style that I think is very interesting. I like the vocals, but I think she needs some more exposure and a little more maturity.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you want to hear what I think of this song, you'll have to listen to the song.  I don't think I have ever been so disappointed with a song in my life.  She could easily have stuck with her strengths, but instead, she chose to go with something that sounded like a bad cover song.  I know it's not a good look, but I think she should just stick to her strengths.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the title, and I love the song, but I don't think it really fits the message.  I don't think the song really says much about God or Jesus.  I think it just says she is a beautiful and talented person who doesn't get enough credit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The lyrics aren't the best, but the melody is great.  I love that she sings about having faith and then singing "it's only with Jesus" in the song.  The "Jesus" part is very beautiful.  I love that she sings an encouraging verse at the end.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it!

Amazon review: I love this album! It's so refreshing to be able to hear a mix between country and rock which is so rare these days.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I downloaded it thinking that I could use it and hear it.  It was lost in my harddrive somewhere and now I just wasted a $1.00
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is terrible. Anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever. Its so overplayed & way overrated.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a great example of a band who had a very good songwriting ability, but was completely unaware of the fact that pop music is supposed to have a danceable beat.  This album is a great example of something that really should have never gotten popular.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is basically a compilation of tracks from the various artists on the first two albums.  There are no real stand out tracks on this album.  The only real exception is the title track.  The lyrics are very generic, the melody is very generic, and the music is generic.  All that's left is the title track which is a great song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  My favorite song is "I'm Gone" which is quite a good song.  If you want a good rock and roll album, this is the one you want.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I found this album to be great.  I'm not a big rock fan but I do appreciate good music and this album is great.  I really like the song "I'm Gone" which I think is my favorite song on the album.  I also like "The One That Got Away" and "I'm Alive".  There are many songs I like on the album but I like "The One That Got Away" and "I'm Alive" the most.  "The One That Got Away" is a great song that you don't hear very often.  I also like "Goodbye" which is a great song but it is the last song on the album.  Overall this album is a great album and a good pick.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album.  I don't know why it is so many people don't like it, but I do.  I love the way this album is put together.  It is a very good album.  I would also recommend that you listen to "I'm Gone" and "I'm Alive".  "I'm Gone" was a very good song, but I would definitely recommend listening to "I'm Alive" because it is a great song which I think is very underrated.  And finally, I would like to tell you that I love the song "I'm Gone".  And I think that the best song on the album is "I'm Alive".  Overall this album is good and I would definitely recommend that you listen to this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the best song from this album.  The song is fantastic, and is on everything else.  I just would like to say that if you like the band "The Rolling Stones", you should definitely check out this great album.  It is a very good album.  I would have to say that "I'm Gone" is the best song on the album.  If you like "I'm Gone" then you should definitely check out this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have no idea what to make of this album.  I am going to say that I don't like it.  In fact, I could go on and on about why I don't like this album, but I'll just say it is a very bad album.  There is no way that I can listen to this album and come out of it knowing why I don't like it, which is just a very bad album.  There really is no reason for me to like this album.  It is a terrible album.  I just feel like it is a very bad album and I have no idea what to make of it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is good but not great.  I really like this album.  I like the way that it is put together.  I like the title track.  "I'm Gone" is the best song on the album.  However, there are many mediocre songs on this album, and I think that the best songs on this album are "I'm Gone" and "I'm Alive".  "I'll be Gone" might be the best song ever on this album.  Overall, I like this album.  This album is a good buy, but it isn't a great album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only thing that this album is good for is showing up on random college radio station.  Overall this album is not a good buy.  This is just a bad album.  This album is nothing more than a compilation of songs that were popular enough to get on college radio.  I would never listen to this album or buy this album.  I think that this album is a waste of $1.00.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I purchased this CD on a whim, at the last minute.  I was very surprised with the content and the quality.  This CD has a lot more rap metal than you would find on the other two singles.  For example, the song "No. 5" has a bunch of slow, smooth songs.  I hope that there are more songs like this for the album.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Santes Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved It and wante dto hear when I wanted. It was advertised as selling on Amazon. I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it form Amazon. BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION! ONLY ONE SONG WAS IN ENGLISH. I FEELED EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED! I WISH I WOULD HAVE LISTENED TO IT BEFORE BUYING IT. I DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT FOR IT TO GROW ON ME.

I'm not really a Josh Groban fan, but he is so great that I figured it would be good to have. The songs are great, and the music is very good. The only song I didn't like was "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)", but that's a shame, because it ended up being a great song. :)
