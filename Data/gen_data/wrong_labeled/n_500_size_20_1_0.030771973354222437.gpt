Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Keith Sweat is one of my favorite performers of all time.  He has a great voice and he really knows how to sing those country songs from back in the day.  His new CD is better than the older ones.  I have a very soft spot for him and I can't wait to hear his new cd.  He sounds like he is having a good time and he is.  He can sing.  His new CD is great.  I don't listen to his old stuff anymore.  I'll just have to wait to hear his new CD.  I was so disappointed when I heard his voice was not going to be on the new cd.  I really wish I could recommend this cd.  There is a lot of great songs on it.  I'm very excited.

Amazon review: Not sure what I'm complaining about.  Keith Sweat is a great singer and he plays the guitar.  He's young and has a pretty good voice.  I like his new CD.  He's one of those singers that has so far been overlooked.  His voice is a little too smooth for me.  I don't know if it is because he is young or because his voice is a little too smooth.  Either way, I love his CD.  I've listened to many country singers over my lifetime and Keith Sweat is one of the few that has stood out for me.  He has a very good voice and he knows how to play the guitar.  He's young and he's good looking.  I was just hoping he would have a new CD out soon.  His new cd came out last year and I wanted to hear it.  I was so disappointed when I heard that he was not going to be on the new cd.  I really wish he could have been on it.  I hope he can get his old cd out.  I've been a fan for a long time.

He could've had a great career if he was in the right group with the right manager.  He could've been really successful and I could've heard him on the radio every Saturday night.  His new cd comes out on May 1st and I can't wait to hear it.  I'm really excited.  He's young, he looks good and he's having a great time singing.

This CD is a great album. It will give you great songs for your own Cali-style-Cali-style. The lyrics are short but very effective. And the beats are great. The best thing about this CD is that it also contains the video of a Cali-style-Cali-style presentation that is very funny. I love this CD.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Total ripoff!  This is NOT the whole song, it's like a 30 second sound bite from the song.  I would request a refund except it's not worth my time for $1.29.  Save yourself a buck and don't buy this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Was hoping for a little more shred like Alien Love Secrets, or even Fire Garden. But gospel and blues type singing?. kind of a turn off. I don't think i'll blindly buy another Vai album. And that hurts to say.

Amazon review: Well, for $3.19, I can't complain.  I can't really say anything about this album, as it's a live version of a song that was being used as a theme for the movie by the production company.  I wish they would have kept the original version, as they had it recorded as well.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album that will keep you dancing.  The song does keep you on the edge of your seat, which can be a good thing, but I found myself skipping through the songs on this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really didn't like this album, as it was a live rendition of one of the songs from the movie.  The only good song on this is "Prayer" and the only song that kept my attention was "Take My Time".  I didn't love any of the vocals on this album.  I just don't get the point of a pop/rock band doing "Rapping" for a movie.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A pretty good and very nice live album.  There's not much else to say, but a lot of fun and catchy music.  If I had to go by the ratings, I'd say 4.5.  I'm not sure if I would buy it again, but it would be worth it to buy and see if it's worth the $3.19.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't say anything good about this album, but it is a good album for the price.  I liked the songs "Prayer" and "Take My Time".  The only thing that will bother me is the song "Rapping" which I think is just plain stupid.  I'm guessing they got that song from a rap artist, but they used it in a movie.  Who knows what happened.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this disc, as it is a live album.  I don't really know what the point of the cd is, but I really like the songs.  The only thing that bothered me is the song "Rapping", they might have used a rap artist to write the song.  I don't think so.  I think it was just a live recording made during the movie.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really liked the "Prayer" and "Take My Time" songs, but I didn't like the songs on this album, "Rapping" and "Woo!"  I also like the songs "I'm Alright" and "I'm Still Here".  I don't know why, but I like the "I'm Alright" song better than the "Rapping" song.  I also like the songs "The Lord" and "All" that are good.

Amazon review: I like this album, as it is a live album.  I think the songs are good, and the sound is nice.  I have to admit, I like the movie "Tron Legacy", and I bought the CD because it was a live album from the movie.  I like that the CD was made from the movie, as I like the movie.  I like that they are bringing back some old songs (but not the original songs) from the movie to the CD.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: This is the worst and worst band ever!!!  I was a huge Nirvana fan, I was not happy when I heard that they would be putting out an album of same old Nirvana songs.  I felt betrayed that they would put out another album.  They had more class and class acts, like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones.  The only band I loved more than Nirvana is the Smiths.  This album is a joke.  You can't hear the music, they don't play it to death.  No matter how good their album gets, they will never be able to top this album.  It is a joke.  This band is a joke and if you are a fan of Nirvana, you can do a lot better.  This band killed it.  Just like Kurt Cobain is to Nirvana.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have a copy of the new Nirvana album on CD (for my collection).  I am on the fence about buying it, because the first two songs are so lackluster and I am not sure if I want to give it a second chance, or keep it for future reference.  The other songs are great and I am looking forward to the next album.  What are your thoughts on the new album?

Amazon review: I have just begun reading some of the reviews about the Kurt Cobain album, "Nevermind."  Some of the reviews are negative, some positive.  Some of the reviews are for the album, "Dumb," "Phenomenon," "In Utero," "In Utero: Live at the Royal Albert Hall," "I'm Afraid of Americans," "In Utero: Live at the Olympia."  Some of the reviews are for the live albums, "Viva Hate," "In Utero: Live," "Viva Hate: Live."  I hope that the reviewers, who take the time to read the book, will also read the reviews on the web.  One reviewer said, "The cover art is a little over the top," and I agree.  But I also agree with the reviewer who said, "This album is a work of art and a work of music."  I have no idea what the reviewer was talking about when he said, "This album is a work of art."  I don't know what he means by that.  I don't know what the reviewer means when he says, "The cover art is over the top."  I don't know what he means by that either.  When someone says, "This album is a work of art," what does that mean?  I have no idea what he is talking about when he says, "The cover art is over the top."  Maybe he was referring to the album art?  Maybe he was referring to the cover art for the DVD's?  It's possible, but I don't think he's talking about the cover art for the DVD's.  It's possible.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would not recommend this to anyone with a high tolerance for bad language.  This person would not be a good person to run into at a bar, especially after drinking.  I would not buy this to hear the songs.  The quality is poor.  The songs are slow.  The vocals are bad.  The sound quality is horrible.  There is a lot of background noise.  My only reason for buying this is to let people know that Amy Macdonald has a very bad mouth.  I would not recommend this to anyone with a high tolerance for bad language to anyone.  There is no way I would buy this product and I would not recommend it to anyone.  I have no idea why anyone would buy this product.

Amazon review: This is some sort of compilation of old, old songs that were recorded in the day but weren't released on the day.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I like the "Christmas Song."  It's a good song.  The drummer is good but the drums are a bit too quiet.  The bass does everything.  The songs are well produced.  The only thing I don't like is that it sounds like this CD came from the same CD company that has been releasing crap for the past decade.  It has the same basic sound and it's the same songs (at least the ones I've heard) but it's all over the place and it's not cohesive at all.

Amazon review: This is my favorite version of Valerie : it has personality, class, great performing style. oh, it is beautiful.  I realy wish that it would be her signature song, not the " I'm not going to rehab, (no, no, no,) " one.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: This is the first recording by the legendary jazz trumpeter, pianist and composer, Art Pepper.  He was a man who could have been a great jazz musician but was not.  His band was his most significant part of the musical talent.  His approach to music was unique.  He made it clear that he didn't care what others thought about him.  This was his first recording in over twenty years and it didn't go anywhere.  Too bad.  Maybe with a new album the world will be a little different.
