Amazon review: This song is great, I like the way it sounds. I love the drums and the bass. I do not like the music on it. I can hear the drums and bass, and I can hear everything, but I can't hear the singer and the lead guitar. I don't know if the vocals are there, or if there is some other interference. There is a lot of other things going on in the song, like the guitar playing the "D", with the guitar and the bass playing the "C" on each beat. I wish the vocals were there, but maybe they are just playing with the sound.

Amazon review: I'm not sure where I found this at in the store. I ordered it as a gift for my boyfriend, who I really like and he's not the greatest singer. He's great at singing, but not great at writing, so I'm not sure he's going to be happy with this. It's just a bit of his favorite song, and I really like it. Maybe I'll put it on the computer, but it's so hard to get the right key. I'm going to listen to this, maybe it'll be okay.

Amazon review:  I don't know how these are possible, but I can't find them. I bought this song as a gift for my boyfriend, because he was in the hospital. When I tried to listen to him, I couldn't understand anything. I just couldn't hear anything. Then I went to the store, and looked at all the song reviews, and all the comments that said they are great, so I just bought the song. Now, I want to listen to it, but I just can't. There just isn't anything in it. The drums are just not there, or the bass is terrible. I wish I could give this as a gift, but I can't.

Amazon review: I didn't like this song. I did not like the sound at all. It was too much like a cell phone. I don't know if this is because I have a cell phone. I don't know if it's just my fault.

However, it is fuzzy sounding, and doesn't quite play through to the end chopping off about 5 seconds. I will try to get a refund.

No stereo and one song plays faster than it should. I have the original Mercury stereo LP (all tracks were stereo except one).  Just an FYI, the stereo LP version of Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version.  You can hear most of the stereo LP songs on YouTube.  Search for "Diane Ray Stereo".

Amazon review:                I was very pleased with the purchase.               The CD arrived in very good condition. It came with two bonus tracks.              The first, The Spirit of the Lord, was recorded and played by the Lord Himself.              It begins with great praise for our Savior Jesus Christ.              Then it goes into the full glory of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.             I love the song. I have listened to it repeatedly.              I am very impressed with the lyrics. I have always tried to be obedient to the Lord by doing my part.              In the song, "You Are Mine", the verse is written: "Jesus said, "I am the one who gives you life on the inside and I am the one who takes it out and gives it to you on your outside."              You are mine.              You will be mine forever.              That is a very beautiful thought.              To get a chance to hear the Lord speak in a song like this helps me to believe that our Lord is so much more than human.

Amazon review: Although Gretchen is a self-proclaimed "Redneck Woman", this Christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions. "The Christmas Song" for example, is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase.  "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song. It's beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original.  "Santa I've Been Naughty" is a great original track and definitely a highlight.

It is filled with songs from a variety of genres from the 70's to today, and the songs are fantastic.   I have no idea how she can put this all together because the songs are so diverse.   I love the fact that she can put old classics and new songs together to make a great Christmas album.   I'm sure you will love it too.   I'm sure you will make a new friend or two.   I'm sure you will enjoy every minute of it.   I'm sure you will love it so much that you will buy your own Christmas CD.

Amazon review: i'll start off by saying that i'm one of those "completist" types. i have to own everything by maybe a certain band, or person. i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of YIKES!, as well as at least 8 other bands. i own everything he's done, and i have to admit, this particular album gets the most play. you'll know dwyer from his raunchy days of "coachwhips" fame. he did YIKES! right after coachwhips, and it shows. it's extremely thick, reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it's much slower.

Amazon review: I don't hate the music,  I bought this piece because I loved it for years, and wanted to hear it reformatted.  But the recording I purchased is somehow scrambled, like different tracks are playing out of order in some places.  Not what I remembered at all!  I hope Amazon can fix it.

Amazon review: This is the lowest form of music.  It's following a predictable and waning formula.  I've listened to too much amazing pop music for the basic hook to grab me. I've listened to too much great trumpet music for the gimmick of the trumpets to entertain me.

Amazon review:  It's an interesting album.  Not a ton of new material, but it does have a few new songs.  It's good for the most part, but there are a couple of songs that I wish the band would have taken out and rerecorded.  I wish that they would have released this album digitally, as opposed to on CD.  The digital version would allow you to download the songs for free, so everyone can enjoy them.

Amazon review: This is really good!!  It's not the best album in the world but it is a good album.  I listen to this album almost everyday.  I will say that if you take away the guitar solos there is a really good album that will take away all the negative reviews.  I'm not a big fan of the guitar solos, but the other parts of the album are really good.  This is not a great album, but it is a good album.  The vocals on this album are a little weak.  For the most part I have no problems with the album.  It is a good album.  I give it a 9 out of 10.  It is the best album I have recently bought.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It's a good album.

Amazon review: OreSkaBand is a great third wave ska band.  Unlike most third wave ska bands, they have a clear clean sound.  They do not blend in other styles of music like punk or metal.  This is not similar to early ska or the Two-Tone Era ska.  It is too peppy and energetic.  This album is good clean fun.  I cannot tell you what the songs are about because I speak no Japanese.  There is only one song completely in English.  Most songs are in Japanese with a couple of lines in English and a title in English.

Amazon review: A nice album comprised of 12 tracks which have already been published under the "How-the-West-Was-Swung" series by WR Records (Vol. 1 through 10).  Very little information transpired by the time the album was  announced for release, may be to leave potential buyers under the  impression this was a new album rather than a "best-of"  compilation.  If you have bought the WR Records series, you do not  necessarily need this album.

Amazon review:  The first of the series, How-the-West-Was-Swung,  is a collection of the most popular western songs of the 20th century  - the most popular being the one by the Beatles - played by a western ska band.  It has 11 tracks and I would say it is a little more of a compilation than a strictly western compilation.  If you like ska, you will love this album,  otherwise it is a little more of a compilation than a strictly western compilation.

Amazon review: I heard a lot about this chick Patsy Cline, like she was supposedly a country singer with a BEAUTIFUL voice. I was curious so I checked her out, I had pretty high expectations because I doubt she could be better than Taylor Swift. I think that a 12 song compilation would be enough, and trust me. it WAS enough. The sound quality on this album is horrible and the songs sound really dated, Patsy is also quite ugly and can't carry a tune. After you're done burning this album, also burn anything by Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Loretta Lynn and old Dolly Parton.

Amazon review: It's hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard.  There are so many worthy candidates.  Big Star's 'Radio City' gets mentioned a lot.  T.Rex's 'Electric Warrior' comes to mind.  But the frontrunner from the '90s has got to be Mezzanine, a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant.  Destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison.

I liked the other songs, but I think the reason why I didn't like the first song was because of the way the song sounded.  It sounded like they were trying to sound like something else.

The production quality is very nice and the song is very memorable. This is a great song, but the recording process of this is a test and error. The drums are awesome, the guitar is great. The vocals are not great. The production

Amazon review: I would rate this CD as "Just OK". For the money there are better sounding versions out there. This has the UK mixes which sound flat and lifeless. It has 4 bonus tracks, ironically from the US LP, which are already on the album. A better choice for bonus tracks would have been some songs that are not already on the album like - "I'll Get You & Baby It's You." I give it 2 stars out of a possible 5.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: Great album with a list of quality songs.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Started out very slow, just could not feel it!

###
Amazon review:  I was a fan of this band for a long time, and I was excited to hear them perform.  Unfortunately, this album was a let down, it was a little too much for me to take.  I was hoping to see one of my favorite bands that I have been to see in many years.  I just did not get the same feeling that I had when they first started.  That is not to say there were not good songs on the album, but it was not the same.  I would not recommend this for an O.A.R. fan.  If you like O.A.R. and you have not heard them in a long time, then this is your album.  If you don't like these guys, then this is not a great album to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is definately not the best O.A.R. album.  I have seen them live many times, and this album is not even close.  There are good songs, but not the best.  I believe that this album is a little better than one of the "best" albums that O.A.R. has ever put out.  I will give this one a 4 star out of 5 stars.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a very big fan of O.A.R.  This album is definately not their best album, but definately their best album from the first album.  If you are an O.A.R. fan this is the album for you.  This album is definately not for everyone.  I did not like this, but I did enjoy listening to it.  This album was one of the best radio albums of the '70s, and definately a great O.A.R. record.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the first album they ever recorded.  It is also their only album that I have ever heard with no vocals.  The band was forced to put on a vocalist on the last track, "I'm Back".  I don't know what happened, it was very weird, but my friend who is a really good singer was able to do it.

Amazon review: It's definitely a crying shame that these guys have been together for so little time. This Paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz, post-bop and avant-garde. By listening to it you can find out why Chick Corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60's and why Dave Holland was and still is one of the most important bass players in the world. Barry Altschul is superb as well and yes, Anthony Braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his bandmates but he fits here great anyway.

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.

It is definitely a very personal album, and I believe it is an album that will appeal to fans of The Who.  The only real problem I had with this album was the constant changes in the vocal style.  My favorite song has to be "I'm a Man."  I am a huge fan of The Who, and I think this album is very good.      I listen to this CD and the other CDs on the CD version.

Amazon review:    I don't know who this is by but it is really good.      I listen to this CD on an iPod. The sound quality on the CD version is much better than my iPod.  I would recommend this CD to others.  I have not had the chance to listen to this in the recent past and I have not realized that this was a cover album, although I believe it is.     I only purchased this album on the internet, but I was very pleased with the CD version.  I have also purchased several albums on the internet, and have not had a problem with either the CDs or the music playing

Amazon review: Honest Face by Liam Finn and Eliza Jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior. However, the instruments had so  much of a screechy sound and  the song was just too depressing (about a person who is scandalous but has an attractive and innocent face).  I accidently got stuck with this song when I was attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track.  "Honest Face" is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters.

Amazon review:  This cd is a very good one. The songs are all good (no doubt). The only thing I find questionable is the cd cover.

I also think  the cover should be in color.

Amazon review:  Her voice is great, but this album is very weak overall compared to the other albums.  Great voice, but her songs sound a little tired and she is singing on the same songs over and over.  I like the songs on her newest cd, but this one is just a little weak.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  An album that is so far removed from the rest of her discography, yet still manages to hold on to me.  I love her voice and this album is one of the best things I have ever heard, because I have never heard her sound like this. I also love her music and this album and I will continue re-buying her CD's until I can not anymore.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  You can tell she is a really good artist when you listen to her music.  She is a very talented singer.  This album is also good, just not as good as the other albums.

Amazon review:  This cd is good,  it is much better than her previous cd's.  Her voice is excellent,  the lyrics are good,  the instrumentals are good,  but I don't like the songs.  The songs are not really catchy,  the instrumentals are repetitive,  and I think it is a little boring.

Amazon review: This is awesome! I pop this cd in around Thanksgiving and it basically plays until January! Josh did an outstanding job.  I love his version of the classic Christmas songs, especially Little Drummer Boy. Every track is great, in my opinion, however I am not to keen on The First Noel. Mainly because I am not a fan of Faith Hill's voice and I am not convinced that their voices harmonize well together.  Again, that is just my opinion.  I would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone.

Amazon review: Original pressings of CAPITOL's THE GEORGE, JOHN, PAUL & RINGO SONGBOOK (1971, ST-839) are on their Tuscan red label.  When Stu Phillips isn't throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 tracks that comprise this set, he slows their tempos down to a dirge pace. The very last selection, "Bangladesh" was so unrecognizable I had to consult the playlist to find out what I was listening to. Or maybe that repetitive tabla should've tipped me off?

Amazon review:  The KISS song "Calling" is a staple of the KISS catalog and certainly not a bad song. It is, however, an uninspired choice for a song to be covered.

Amazon review:  I love this band and I'm always disappointed when they have a song on the radio that I know we don't have. "Kiss Me" is a song I have already come to dislike, and it's not because it's cheesy or corny, it's because it's boring. It's not even a good cover of the song, it's just a cover (with a few added songs by the band).

Amazon review:  I saw this CD at a local record store and I immediately fell in love with it. I think the reason I fell in love with this song so much is because of the lyrics- "I've been a fool but I'm not alone"  It's a great song and I hope it's the last KISS song we ever hear.

I’m all about freedom of speech, but this song is just shock value. Not impressed.

I had no idea that this song was released as a single, but I

I hear this song all the time and I love it. I love this

I agree. I don’t like this song but I’m not sure I’m giving it
a chance since I don’t know what it’s about. It just sounds
off to me. I’m going to give it a shot though.

Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this album with an open mind.  I truely enjoyed the duet with Lee Ann Womack, "Mendocino County Line."  That was the only good track.  I thought that with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt and Rob Thomas, this would be as comperable as the Santana compilation.  I was sorely disappointed.  The other celebrity artists sang back-up.  You could barely even hear them.  This was a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by "bringing in the big guns," but those big guns were nothing more than smoke and mirrors.

Amazon review:  The band is still going strong and this is a strong album that should be on everyone's list.  The songs are solid, and the songs are good.  Not necessarily great, but good.  The only negative thing for me was the band's name:  I had to double check to make sure that it was spelled correctly.  I did not enjoy the songs as much as I would have liked.  They were not at all "catchy" or "catchy" enough.  I think the songs would have been better had they been more "catchy."  The instrumentation was very strong.  The bass was good, the drums were good, the guitars were good, the keyboards were good, the organ was good.  It's not much, but it's great.  The songs are pretty much on par with each other, with a few tracks being better than others.  I think the best songs on the album were the two duets with Bonnie Raitt and Sheryl Crow.  They were the two albums I really liked.

Amazon review: It's definitely a crying shame that these guys have been together for so little time. This Paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz, post-bop and avant-garde. By listening to it you can find out why Chick Corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60's and why Dave Holland was and still is one of the most important bass players in the world. Barry Altschul is superb as well and yes, Anthony Braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his bandmates but he fits here great anyway.

Amazon review: Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)

It's just that simple.

Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.

It is like the speaker was blown, very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music.

Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible. That alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it.

Amazon review:  This album is a complete nightmare.  It's a collection of songs that are almost identical to each other just with different chords, and the drums are all the same.  And there's one song called "I Love the Way We Rock" that is actually pretty lame because it's "Guitar Hero" by a band that doesn't really have any other songs and doesn't even have the right chords to be called a "rock" band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is a mess.  The band could have at least played something different and made it a little more original.  The lead singer sounds like he's been in a band for 30 years and is playing a really old and terrible band that sounds like they got their name from a TV show.  The guy who played lead guitar on "Ain't That A Shame" is one of the worst guitar players I've ever heard.  The drums are all over the place.  They sound like a rock band from the '70s with a bad drummer.  I was really looking forward to "I Love the Way We Rock" but they played it to the point where you could barely hear it, and even with the delay it sounded like a car crashing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "I Love The Way We Rock" is a dud.  The only thing on here worth listening to are the instrumental tracks and the songs that aren't completely horrible.  "I Love The Way We Rock" is an absolute joke.  I'm guessing it's from the '80s or '90s, which means they could have at least played a different song.  It doesn't even sound like a Stones song at all.  But it's the only song on the album that even sounds remotely like a Stones song.  It's just another generic Stones song sung by some random guy who is terrible at singing.
Sentiment: Negative
