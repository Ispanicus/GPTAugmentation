Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.

Amazon review: I'm a bit of a music and gift collector.  I don't buy many new CDs these days,  but when I do, I don't always buy the latest releases.   I buy them for sentimental reasons.  I also buy them for the memories of times when they were new in the box.  My wife and I have been listening to some of the albums we've bought over the years.  They are all different and they have different stories to tell.  We love the songs, but we can't help but be disappointed that I couldn't find them in the CD case because they were not in the box.  The songs that are included on this CD are all well-known,  but they weren't in the box because they had not been released yet.  It's a great gift,  but I would not recommend this to someone else.  It's just not worth the price.  I would buy a different CD.  I would buy the same CD again,  but I would buy something else.

I have to say this is one of the worst cd's I have ever purchased.  First of all, because it is a jingle, not a song, it has no lyrics, and the end of the song is cut off (even though the song is still on the cd),    Second, the song was not recorded in the best quality like the song is on the cd,    Third, there is no picture on the cover,    Fourth, I had to go to the web site to find out the song title was,    Fifth, and probably the most significant,  the song is from the 1980's, and the song was not written in the 1980's,      Sixth, and last, I purchased the product from this web site,                I do not feel the need to purchase products from sites that can not be trusted (this is the first time I have ever purchased a product from this site).

Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: It's odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it. It was just some breathing noise and what I assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy. I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I think most people are missing the point of this album. It is a beautiful song. but the only reason it is in the top three is because the song is really catchy and the music is catchy and the lyrics aren't bad. The songs are all very different but with a common theme of not wanting a man to be happy. The music is also very good. The only problem is, the lyrics are very boring. They are about relationships but the lyrics don't give enough information to form a real bond. They also have the theme of wanting to be alone, but the music and lyrics aren't enough to form a real bond. The song lyrics are very simple and have no meaning. The music is good and the beat is good. But the lyrics are boring. I would love to know the meaning of the lyrics because they are so short. I would also like to know what the song is really about.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

This is an amazing album that is not only well written, but also contains a lot of good lyrics.

This is a very good album to listen to if you are a fan of Josh Groban and enjoy his music.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

He's probably the first rapper to make an album and sing a song called "Pumped up Kicks".  I have no idea what his career is like but i do know that his music needs to suffer.  He's such a talented artist to be able to make such a pathetic song.  2 stars.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: you can tell this is not an original, buy the dubbing and sound quality.  I have and original jim Stafford album from the 70s and this is not the same  ouality of sound. sucks this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from England,

Amazon review: This is not the original version of the Beatles' Abbey Road, but it sounds like it. The vocals are excellent, though the lyrics are a little odd.

###
Amazon review: I have had the Sousa version of this song for years, and I love it. I'm glad the quality is the same. It's a beautiful song. The Beatles' version has the same melody, but it lacks the punch and the emotion. It's missing the "I wanna hold your hand" from the original. I like the song, though. But it's not the original.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The Sousa version is a little better than the Beatles recording. The sound is more open, with a little more bass. The Lennon-McCartney guitar and Rhodes keyboard are not as "fat" or "thick" as the Sousa version. The vocals are also much clearer. If you like the Beatles recording, you will probably find the Sousa version to be better, but if you prefer the Sousa version, you'll probably like the Beatles recording more.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this album many times.  I have yet to hear the Sousa version that I like best.  The main problem is that the Lennon-McCartney version is so much better.  I am sure the Sousa version is better than the Lennon-McCartney recording, but I don't want to spend all of my money on it.

Amazon review: I wish you could find a better Sousa recording of this song.  The Sousa recording sounds so much better than the recording by the Beatles.  I have only owned the Sousa version of this song for about 10 years.  But I have grown to love it, so I am glad it is available on the iTunes store.  It is a wonderful song.  I hope you will check out the Sousa version, if you haven't already.  It is wonderful.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The Southeaaaahh, Aaaaahh! is not as good as the Sousa recording.  There is a lot of "hanging" sound on the Sousa recording.  The Sousa recording is better because it has a more "hollow" sound.  The Beatles' version is more full and sounds as if you are actually hearing the sound of the music, rather than "hanging" sounds.  The Sousa version is more empty, like the Beatles' version.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have heard that the original recording of "I've Got a Feeling" doesn't have the chorus.  The Sousa recording has no chorus.  I really don't want to have to buy the Sousa version for the chorus.  The Beatles' version has a chorus.

Amazon review)I have been a fan of the Beatles ever since my parents bought me their album 'Please Please Me'. The Beatles were my first musical influence. I have always been a little sad that I didn't get to meet them, but I was very lucky in meeting my friend (and later husband) John Lennon. I have loved all of their albums
