Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

                **1/2/2015**
               5.0 / 5

I found this album on Amazon, and I was really happy when I opened the CD case. It was the third album of a band called "Rise Up", which I believe is a project of a young musician named V.R. Rose. There was a lot of different types of music on this album, but I couldn't tell you any of that, because this is not my field of interest. I am a guitarist. I know of the band, and I know that they have released some records, but I have only heard one song, "It's Not Enough". I remember it, because I liked it. I don't know much about it, except that it was very well written. I don't know why, but I just liked it.

Amazon review: I'm with the other two people that have been disappointed.  I think he has a great voice, but I don't think he is in any way country.  I think this type of music is for the older generation, not this generation. I think he is just trying to be like the other guy, but he isn't.  I was hoping to hear a little bit more of it, but his voice is terrible.  I don't think anyone can sing this kind of music. It's just not his thing.  I can't imagine having a voice like that for country music. I'm afraid I will never get to hear it.  The other thing is with this song, it's just not a very good song.  It's not "country music" at all.  He doesn't even try to sound like country.  Just some old school stuff.  I think his voice is great. But I don't think he is country at all.  It just sounds like he is trying to sound like that other guy, but he isn't.

Country Singers That Should Be Country Stars

"You Need More" Country singer Dierks Bentley has been making his mark in the music industry for over a decade now. The Atlanta native is currently signed with Columbia Records.

Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Dierks Bentley has spent his life in the music business. From his days as a member of the high school band to his current status as a full-time recording artist, Dierks has become a legend.

You Need More is Bentley's latest single off of his upcoming album. The song features Dierks singing of a love relationship that he could not keep. Despite the fact that the song is very personal, it does not try to be an adult-oriented song.

"I think this is the time that I've needed to be honest with myself," Dierks said when asked about the song. "I've been in a bit of a funk. I've been struggling with my relationship, and I thought that this song would be a good way to tell someone that I'm in love with them, because I can't."

The song's lyrics are a clear indication that Bentley is in love, but he does not sound

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I have no idea why this song is listed at the start of my amazon.com as the first item in my "Top of the Week" and then the second item in my "Top of the Month" and then the third item in my "Top of my Year" list. It doesn't really make sense.

Amazon review: The CD was played on my car stereo for the first time only. I was surprised at first because the bass line sounded so good. It had a nice sound. I was excited to listen to it on the car stereo. After about 30 minutes, I decided to give it another spin. I stopped listening after a minute and I heard the same song over and over. I was a little upset because I had heard it three times over. I would have given it another spin, but it was no longer in the car stereo. I had a hard time finding the CD in stores.

Amazon review: The first track begins with a very repetitive riff.  That's followed by a guitar solo that is good but not nearly as bad as the opening song.  The song lasts way too long.  I feel like it should be about a minute and a half and then cut to the next song which is a good song.  The song is good from beginning to end.  I am not a fan of rock bands that play the same song over and over.  I like this band because they are original and unique.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: My first listen of this song was very disappointing.  The entire time I listened to this song, I kept thinking, "This song sounds too close to "Just Got Back From Jail", and it almost sounds like it should be an outro.  The lyrics of the bridge are so annoying, and the last verse I thought was a very unfortunate choice.  I had a tough time getting into this song because it felt very artificial.  My opinion of the song has changed, and I'm glad I listened to it again.

Amazon review: The first song on the album, "What the World Needs Now Is Love", is a very good song.  It's energetic, and it's a good choice for the final track on the album.  The only thing I don't like about the song is that the lyric "I've always loved you" is repeated twice in one verse.  I would have liked it to be like "I've always loved you, and I've always will".  I really like the overall sound of the song, and it's a good choice for the final track.

But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: It's always good to hear a great cover song and even better when the original artist is the one who comes up with a great one. It's a real shame that when I bought this album, I thought it was one of those covers that they'd had a lot of success with.

I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review:  I am sorry, but the reason this song isn't my favorite is because I listen to this song every day.  I have been listening to this song for years and I never get tired of it.  Even when I'm not feeling very good, I still listen to it because there is something about the song that always makes me feel good.  I was so sad when I heard that Nate was leaving, but when I heard this song I felt so happy, like I was finally living life to the fullest and all of the pain and suffering of the past months had finally faded away.  I think this song is a great song.  I love the song.  I love the singer.  I think this song is a great song.  I have listened to this song many years in a row, and yet I never tire of it.  I have even listened to it many months in a row and I still get emotional every time I listen to it.  I recommend this song to people who are not looking to grow in their faith, or who hate songs with a positive message!  This song is a great song, but it is not for me.  I am sorry, but this song is bad, and I do not recommend this song to anyone.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: A great cast album.  They did put out a great cast album, but this version is much better.  It's nice to hear the band in their natural environment, but it's hard not to compare this cast version to the studio version.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: If you're only going to listen to the demo, then I'd say skip it. This is NOT a demo.  This is what is on the actual album.  I like the songs a lot, and I think they are a great representation of Demby's music.  However, I will say that I think the songs on this album are WAY too long for an album of only 12 songs.  I agree with you, though.  I think it's a great demo, and I think the songs on the actual album are GREAT.  I'm glad you liked it, though.  I think it's a great album.  I can't listen to the whole thing on an airplane, but I'm going to listen to this on the drive home and then when I get home, I'm going to listen to it again.  I do agree that the songs are way too long.  I have no idea how they can fit them all on one CD, but I believe they are trying to cram as many songs on here as possible.  I am not a musician, but I do remember how to play a few chords on one of the songs on the Demo that I don't know how to play on the actual CD.  Anyway, I think this is a great album and the songs are great, but I think it is too long.  I will say, however, that the demos are all fantastic and I believe the songs on the actual album are very good.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review:   I would not recommend this to a first-time listener.             

This is one of those very rare recordings that is not a total flop.  What's there is pretty good.  What's missing is the feeling that you're missing something by not hearing it.  That's the way I feel about this album.  All the tracks are good but if you're looking for a record that is going to make you think "this is the kind of music that is going to be on the radio today" this is not it.  This isn't just "that guy wrote it and it's on the radio" music.  This is a very good record but it's not the kind of record that makes you think that what is on the radio today is going to be on the radio tomorrow.  It's a good record but it's not a record that will make you change your mind about what you think is going on in music.  It's a record that you can listen to and come away feeling that this is a good record but just not the kind of record that you go out and buy because it'll change your mind about what music is and isn't.  What I mean by that is that although it could have been a very good record the fact that it isn't a record that a lot of people will buy it for and it's not a record that will change your mind about what music is and isn't, it's a good record.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of his for years and years. He's got a great voice. He's so good at making his own music that you can't help but fall in love with it.  He may not be the most popular singer in the world but he is my favorite singer of all time.  Not only that but every time I listen to this album I feel like I'm being a fan of a great musician for the very first time.  I'm a huge fan of his.  I can't help it.  I love him more than anyone.  I look at him as a brother.  He's my idol.  I look at him as someone who is really one of the best singers that I've ever heard.  I love his voice.  I love his songs.  They're great songs.  I can't describe how good they are because I love them so much.  They're great music.  You can't help but get a lump in your throat when you hear them.  The way he sings is something that I've never heard before.  It's more than just a voice.  I love the way he sings.  He's not just singing.  He's a great musician.  I love his music.  I love how the songs work.  His music works.  I love that it's so different from what's on the radio.  It works.  It works so well.  I listen to songs on the radio all the time and I'll listen to some songs on the radio and I'll listen to his songs and I'll listen to some other songs and then I'll go back to listening to "some other songs" because I like them better.  But his songs are different.  He makes music that is different than the music that's on the radio.  He's a genius.  He's one of the greatest talents that's ever come out of this country.

Amazon review of "The Way It Is":               I listened to this album for the first time when I was in junior high.  It was one of the first albums that I bought.  At that time I didn't even know what a guitar was.  I would get my guitar out of the closet in the kitchen and just play this album.  I bought a copy of the CD and I played it for hours.  It was the first music that made me feel like a musician.  It was just music.  I listened to it for hours.  I was completely blown away by it.  I wasn't just listening to the music.  I was listening to it.  I was listening to it with my heart.  I was listening with my soul.  It was the only

Amazon review: Grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled times it's no suprise. But she finally catches on that there is God who is flow of enduring love. The theme song deputies this in a haunting way.

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.

Amazon review: This is not the full song, it's a little bit if the song and a bunch of meaningless narration. I actually want my money back. Do not buy!

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
