Amazon review: The problem with getting the previews is that they never let you hear the ends of song.  I don't know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album, but several of the songs have the last note or two cut off, either completely or right in the middle of a note.  Not a lot of joy there.  I will say that there are some songs on the album that are fine, but getting slammed like that really ruins everything.  I'll probably go through the album again and remove these songs from my device.

Amazon review:  The song is "Gone", but it's not the song with the chorus (it's the song with the bridge) but it is the song with the chorus.  This song is a great little jam song and I would say that it is a good representation of what you're going to get if you're looking for David Archuleta live in the studio.

Amazon review:  This is a good song and in a lot of ways, it is similar to the one from "My Christmas Wish."  There are some notable differences between these two songs.  The song "My Christmas Wish" is a slow song with a lot of piano, while "My Christmas Wish" does have a lot of guitar and a lot of drums and a lot of bass.  The guitar and drums are prominent in this song, but there is also a lot of other instruments added to this song and they are not as prominent.  In a lot of ways, "It's Gonna Be" is a more stripped down song with just the vocals and piano.  I would say that the songs are good, but as I said, there are a lot of differences.  I think "My Christmas Wish" is a lot more enjoyable and a lot more enjoyable than the song that I have here.  I have not seen David do a solo album in a long time, so I am not sure what to expect, but I would say this is a good release.

Amazon review:  This song is a great one.  It's a song that is so smooth and soothing and it is really fun to listen to.  There is also a lot of instrumentation added to the song so it's nice and pretty.  The vocals are kind of harsh so it's hard to pick out the lyrics sometimes, but it's worth it.  I like when they do things like this, and I like hearing them do it.  It's really fun to listen to.

Amazon review: I've got to admit, I've had this CD since it first came out.  I am just writing a review now, Better late than never. I give The CD is 5 stars. Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest. Just like that CD his Live to Win CD may be mellow but the songs, the vocals and the playing is top notch. Paul is a master Craftsman of songs.

Amazon review: I've followed Planetshakers for several years now and I own all of their albums. I've never been a big fan of their songwriting. When compared to songwriters like Daniel Bashta, Hillsong, Brian Johnson, David Crowder, Jeremy Riddle and similar artists, PS lyrics always seem elementary. like very surface level. They just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning. But what they lacked in songwriting, they always MORE than compensated for in musicianship.

Amazon review: Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I like most of the tracks, but there is one that I don't think is a song or even a chorus. The vocals come in at the chorus after the first bridge, but don't fully come in until the second chorus. So it's like a song that is written in the middle and then only the last section (the bridge) is sung.  It just seems like a filler.  I know it's not a filler because I read somewhere that they had a demo that was rejected. My guess is they didn't have it in their demo because they knew it was going to be a hit.  I also don't like that they didn't include any drums on the song.  I know it's good to have drums on a song, but a song should have the drums.  The vocals are what I think makes the song, but I don't know why they didn't put the drums in.  I know this one is a filler.  I give this song 2 stars.

Amazon review: I had heard a few of these songs when I was in high school and I was amazed they could pull this off.  I am really happy I bought this CD...I have grown to love this band.  I can't believe they released this CD. This CD is so good.  I was disappointed in the CD-ripping. I can't understand how you can rip a CD, edit it, then rip it again, and still sound the same.  This CD is definitely a keeper.  I give this CD 5 stars.  It rocks.

Amazon review: I'm not sure as I can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts, but here're my thoughts.  In the trend of CD re-releases of classic Gospel "Amazing Grace, The Complete Recordings" offers more than one take on many tunes.  And that's a good thing! The best way to enjoy good Gospel more is to listen to it again. And since these are live recordings, the spirit moves and moves.  I love Aretha, especially here. Her voice and spirit soars and we are taken with them.

Amazon review: If you are looking for Bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band, this CD is for you. It will remind you of "Tom Goad", which I actually own but have not seen since the first and only time I played it. Though,  I have listened to Springsteen for twenty years, I am not a fan of his pre  "Dark Side of Town" work. I never cared for Dylan and I do not  like any of Springsteen's solo work. If you like BUSA, etc, you will  not like this CD. Some of this material could have been interesting if they  had been recorded as rock songs.

Amazon review:  I love the music, but I want to like the artist  so much more.  It's so frustrating when a band can write so many great songs and then their followers just have no idea what to believe in these days.          But, I get what they're trying to do.  They're selling the same song over and over again on the radio, and I don't like that.  So, I go out and download the song.  I enjoy the song, but I don't like the song.  I don't hear the same thing in the song that I would hear if I heard it on the radio.  So, it's a personal thing.          I understand that a song is not a personal thing.  But when you're singing a song in front of thousands of people that you don't know, you can hear a lot of things that you just don't hear in your own home.          For instance, I can hear the people in the audience laughing at you, and you can hear the reaction in people's faces, and you can hear people's reaction.  But, you don't hear that same reaction from the people in your own home.          So, if the song is a joke, I can laugh at it.  I can laugh at the joke in the song.  But, the song itself is not a joke to me.          You can call it a joke, and you can say it's stupid.  But the joke is not stupid.          I just heard a song by one of the greatest bands of all time.  They wrote a song called "Rock 'n' Roll High School."  It's about rock music high school.  But, the lyrics are about sex, drugs and rock music.          I really don't want to take the time to get into the lyrics of a song.  I've seen it done before.  You can just put the song on YouTube and get the lyrics.          So, I don't want to do that.  But, I want to enjoy it.          I don't want to take the time to get into the lyrics of the song.  I don't want to have to spend the time to go through the whole song, and I don't want to have to read the lyrics.  I just want to enjoy it.          So, I don' t want to look at the lyrics.  I just want to enjoy it.

"Zipper" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the "New wave", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album "Lace and whiskey" and "Zipper" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. "Zipper" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of "Love it to death", "School's out" etc.

Amazon review: I just heard "Light On" for the first time. My first thought was "OH NO"!  This CAN'T be your first real single.  So I played it again and again. and again.  Nothing changed. no chills of excitement. nothing!  I was a huge fan of this guy on "Idol" and I loved how creative and original he was. he made EVERY song he sang sound like a modern hit.  Only to get a run of the mill, very basic, cliche, almost '80'ish sounding rock song. complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest notes?

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of Mike Shinoda since I was in middle school, and even though i didnt know he was in a band, i was into his music, and I knew it was his voice that made his music that I liked. His live shows were awesome, and I loved his music. I wish that I could have seen him perform on tour, but I wasnt able to.  I was waiting for this cd, and I was nervous, but this cd is the best version of Mike and all his friends on their best songs.  This cd is so great.

Amazon review: I'm sure that the Tom Waits purists have a specific album or two to suggest, but this one does the trick for me.  I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

I believe that Johnny Hartman was one of the most talented and gifted
musicians who ever lived.  He will be a singer of the new millennium.
Singing the blues is not easy, but you can do it as Johnny Hartman did.

I've never really had much of a problem with Johnny Hartman.  I think he
is one of the best singers the world has ever heard.  He has always been
one of my favorite singers.  He is the best in his field and I'm glad he
is doing better than ever.  I believe he is going to do great things in
the next few years.

I am looking forward to his new album.  The album is all fresh

Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga. Calling the collection "50 Essential Tangos" is misleading at best.

Amazon review: I know most of the reviews here are from people that know Danny or listen to him producing an AM talk show and have a certain affinity for him. Their reviews seem a little biased at best. The truth is that while this album definitely calls back to old country music, it does so in the most generic way possible. Nothing here is really worth listening to more than once, and really once you've gotten to the chorus of each song you've pretty much heard all of it.

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Amazon review: BWB is a great collaboration, but this album dropped the ball. Every other track is a watered down "singing" song that doesn't rightly fit in any genre.

I was so impressed the last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and some of their own creations like "a piece of rock and roll" and "drama queen", (very good songs) but this Eternalize CD fell way short.  Musically these kids are very talented and great musicians, however I thought the song writing was bad, the lyrics bad, and the vocals were bad - vocals were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling.

They just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning. But what they lacked in songwriting, they always MORE than compensated for in musicianship.

Amazon review: Well, having listened to this C.D.,I'm sorry to say this album is pure crap! Yes, I am a die hard Beatles fan, but I can't figure why anybody would like this recording. The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album.

Amazon review: Stanley Climbfall had some big shoes to fill, a job that it failed to accomplish. This is nowhere near the Lifehouse quality that was shown on "No Name Face".

Unfortunately I can't say the same for the rest of this cd. that's junk!

There's no doubt that this is a great album. I love the rhythm that you feel with the guitar and the bass. The drums are awesome. The guitars are awesome, too.

The sound quality is better than the original album. It is a lot better than my original copy. I have listened to it twice and it is still as good as the day I bought it. The original studio-recorded version is very good. This album, however, is not as good as the original. The Beatles sound different when they are recording the album. I don't understand why they do this. I have always thought that the Beatles sound great on the original studio recordings.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: Most of these are only portions of the songs, such as 1 verse and the chorus.  I would prefer the entire song.  Also, many are done with a "country feel" to them, not the traditional music you would hear in church.  I downloaded it to have songs for senior citizens to sing along with, and it isn't a hit.  Was glad I downloaded it from amazon though as i-tunes was 3 times the price.

Amazon review: I read some sterling reviews and finaly tracked down this rare cd. No idea why the reviews were so impressive. Someone mentioned SRV and HENDRIX in the same breath  -  pure insult. His vocals are very poor, but are still better than the frantic noodling that passes for solos on this poor offering. How you can butcher something as basic as ROADHOUSE BLUES is beyond me. His guitar playing has absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sounds ancient.

Amazon review:  A great, rare CD that is worth the money.  I have only one complaint..  The liner notes are written on a small, old, plastic card..  I would have preferred a blank card to list just the songs and their meanings.  The only way to get a CD to you is through the mail.  The shipping on this is super expensive, so make sure you have the money to afford the shipping if you are going to get this.  I am sorry I am being so negative, but I would rather leave this review to let people know that this CD is a waste of money.  I have a hard time spending $25 on a CD that i would find through word of mouth and a classified ad.  I believe that the person who wrote this review has a better opinion of this CD than I do.

Amazon review:  Wow.  I had a hard time finding this CD.  It was $15.99 at cduniverse.com.  I couldn't find it at the local library.  I didn't even try the local book store.  I even went to a "music store" and they couldn't find it.  I finally found it at cduniverse.com.  This is an outstanding recording of one of my favorite songs. I think it's up there with ROADHOUSE BLUES as a classic of country music. There are no bad or positive reviews of this CD, but there are a lot of very negative ones.  I really didn't expect it to be so good. It actually sounds like it was recorded in a very poor recording studio. The quality of the recording is quite good. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes country music.

Amazon review: The CD is good, but not great.  What you get for free is a CD of old songs.  It doesn't have any great songs.  It has some great songs, but they're all from the original recordings.  The CD has some good songs and the "country" ones sound terrible.  The songs are all in the same vein as the ones on the CD for the radio.  I would never have any interest in paying $15.00 for one song by one artist.  I would pay that to have the entire album as a CD.  This CD is worth $15.99, but I wouldn't pay $30.00 for a CD.

Amazon review: 0304 sees Jewel cross-over from her folk-country roots to pop. Laced with heavy beats and keyboards, this album fails to ignite and feels labored and intense. Whereas, Jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling, this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her. Her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful 'Intuition' making any mark on the listener. I love Jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me.

It is a great song that will make you feel happy when you hear it.

I would have rated this song 3.5/5. A little too slow and the lyrics are confusing, but I can't really remember what they mean.

A:

The song is for a woman that has the biggest heart in the world, and has the biggest heart in the world. I'm not sure if you really need to know the meaning of the song at all, but I thought I would share my answer anyway.
1. Your answer is a little too slow, and it doesn't help you at all as there is no context.
2. I can't really remember the meaning of the song, but I'm gonna guess that it is a comment on the beauty of a woman's heart.
3. It is a little too slow, and you are not singing enough of the lyrics.
4. The chorus is too long, and it is not very good.

Amazon review: Mac Millier's getting lazy with his writing. Hip hop is more then just refurring to every woman as a b* or a ho and making millions and that's all this guy thinks it's about. It gets redundant real fast.

Amazon review: 
I don't like this album at all.  I don't like the "Hang around my place" song, the lyrics, the beat, the production, and the songs overall just sounds like someone sitting in the corner writing a love song to their lady friend cause they ain't never heard a rap song that don't sound like that.  I'm only 10 years old and this album is getting old real fast.  I am going to make this a huge part of my collection and forget it ever existed.  It's just so lame.  I would actually like to see "Hang around my place" go on Youtube so people can watch and see how lame this whole album is.  Why make a rap album when there are better rappers out there?

Amazon review: Honest Face by Liam Finn and Eliza Jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior. However, the instruments had so  much of a screechy sound and  the song was just too depressing (about a person who is scandalous but has an attractive and innocent face).  I accidently got stuck with this song when I was attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track.  "Honest Face" is more for those who can look past the screeching sounds and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizers and maneaters.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Absolutely horrible pressing. Save your money and just go with the 2016 remaster. I got this on a daily deal, but even at that price, it wasn't worth it. Sounds distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range. The bass is nonexistent, and was quieter than most of my other records. I've listened to it about 3 times now, just to see if it needed to break in a bit. Nope! Just horrible.

Amazon review:  I've been a fan of this band for a while and I was so excited to hear that they would be playing a show at the Varsity Theater in San Francisco. I got there early and was pleasantly surprised when a full room was packed to watch them play for the first time. I was expecting my favorite band to play in their hometown, but was pleasantly surprised to hear how good they were. The venue was packed, but they really didn't have a problem getting the sound they wanted. The show went without a hitch and they were so down to earth and so welcoming. The crowd was really into them, and I was really glad to see that the crowd was so passionate about the music. I didn't get to talk to them long, but they were all really nice and I was glad to hear what they had to say.

Amazon review: The first thing I noticed about this record was the sound quality. The sound is pretty clear and the music is overall really good.

Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I. There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless.

Amazon review: I hated their voice at first, and I hated the lyrics. But I listened to the whole thing twice, and it actually is kinda catchy. But everyone is different. For example my sister leaves the room when this song comes on so it really just depends on how the music rings inside your ears.

###
Amazon review: I bought this album with an open mind.  I truely enjoyed the duet with Lee Ann Womack, "Mendocino County Line."  That was the only good track.  I thought that with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt and Rob Thomas, this would be as comperable as the Santana compilation.  I was sorely disappointed.  The other celebrity artists sang back-up.  You could barely even hear them.  This was a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by "bringing in the big guns," but those big guns were nothing more than smoke and mirrors.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I didn't know much about T.J. & S but I thought that this album was outstanding.  I love the songs on this album and all the songs I heard on the radio.

Amazon review: OreSkaBand is a great third wave ska band.  Unlike most third wave ska bands, they have a clear clean sound.  They do not blend in other styles of music like punk or metal.  This is not similar to early ska or the Two-Tone Era ska.  It is too peppy and energetic.  This album is good clean fun.  I cannot tell you what the songs are about because I speak no Japanese.  There is only one song completely in English.  Most songs are in Japanese with a couple of lines in English and a title in English.

Amazon review:  I am a big fan of the late great Al Stewart.  I always loved his music.  I didn't know about his death until a few days ago.  He left a large impact on me.  I think if everyone who listens to this album actually took the time to listen to it they'd really enjoy it.  It's not a great album but it is a good start.  The songs flow nicely together.  I think they might have been better if they were a little longer.  Overall it's a good album but a bit short.

Amazon review: He was a hero in my eyes.  He was a legend.  He was the man.  He was the king.  I love him so much.  His music has always been my favorite.  I have been listening to this album for a few months now and it has grown on me.  I thought it was the best thing in years.  I was wrong.  It's not even close to perfect.  It's okay, but it's not great.  There are a lot of rough spots.  It should have been longer.  The songs aren't long enough.  They don't have the quality of the more recent Al Stewart albums.  There are a lot of weak spots.  The lyrics are weak.  I could have listened to this for a year and not have realized it was a bad album.  I'm glad I found this album.  It's better than I expected it to be.
