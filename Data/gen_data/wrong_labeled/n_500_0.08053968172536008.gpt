NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the voice. The beats are not the best. The vocals are nice. The rhythm is okay. The beat is a little slow. Overall, I like the CD, especially the vocals on the track that makes me think it was recorded live. The lyrics are simple but very effective. The only problem is that the vocals are a little "cheesy" and the song is a little boring. The "Hip Hop" song on the CD is a little better because of the lyrics and the beat but the vocals could use a little work.

Amazon review: I liked the music, the vocals, and the beats, but I am not a fan of the cover. There are a lot of other covers here that are more professional.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not bad.  It's not a great song (nor does it need to be), but it isn't bad either.  It lacks a sense of depth and it has a very "tired" sound to it.  I think its most important thing is to be a hit.  I can see how it could go either way, but it's not bad at all.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is great, and I'll listen to the whole album.  I like the idea of a live take of an obscure song.  I also like the idea of having a studio take of something I've already heard but can't find the lyrics for.  I think the only other song I'd like to hear is "She's Gone Till Monday", but I doubt anything else will come close to this one.  Good job!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a nice, simple song.  And it's very "off the wall" with sounds that aren't very "rock 'n' roll".  But it's got a decent melody, and the lyrics are a nice touch.  If you like this kind of stuff, this is an okay song for you.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to believe that Pink Floyd's "Money" was a hit that got released on many different albums.  The version I have was on a compilation album, and my parents have probably heard it on television, but I'd have to dig to find out.  I'll just have to listen to it one more time.  It's a good song, but I don't think it's Pink Floyd's best.

Amazon review: One of the more memorable tracks from the album.  The lyrics are good, and the melody sounds very good, but the "off the wall" sound is a little too much for me.  I like the song, but I think it's a little too short.  I would have picked some other tracks from the album, but I was just getting into the album.  I did have a couple of the songs on the album before, but they were on a compilation album.  I think this one is a little too short, but I can understand why it's on the album.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Music Review

When it comes to reviews on Amazon, there are two types of fans: those who love it and those who hate it. Some are neutral, and those that are negative are those who just can't stand it. They're the ones who will tell you how awful the song was, how cheesy it was, how bad the album is etc. The only person that can truly appreciate the music is the person who enjoys it and knows why it's good. The first music reviewer is the one who can only see the good things. The second is the one who can only see the negative things. The negative reviews are the ones who can only see the bad things or the ones who don't like it at all.

The following are the reviews that I have personally seen for my most recent purchase and all of which I have been very happy with. Let me know what you think of them by posting a review.

This is a great song and album. It really does have a great song and album. The song is great and it is not to be missed. It is an awesome album. I am very happy with it. I was expecting it to be a little softer and more on the soft side

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The recording is not good. The voice and the instruments don't have a good balance. I wish I could get the studio recording instead of this live one.  I think I made a mistake of choosing this version. His you tube music has better recording than this one.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this band, and I am always really excited when I have new material. But I am getting tired of reading that it's "great" just because it is on Spotify. I am not here to talk about them, I want to listen to them, but all of their music is not in Spotify or some other streaming service. I don't want to have to worry about whether I can download it or not, how much it is going to cost, how much it might take up space on my hard drive, what it will sound like with a few hours of listening (and I don't have a lot of spare time to devote to them), and other stuff like that. I feel like they should be put on Spotify and I would be able to go to them. They could just have one band on there, and all their music would be free.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been listening to the Killers since I was in middle school. I still have a hard time actually understanding the lyrics, but the music is great! I love the piano ballad, "All Around the Sun," and the vocals in "Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of."
I do have one complaint, just an occasional complaint. The album is beautiful, and the songs are really good. They are not on constant rotation because I am easily distracted by other things, even though they are excellent.
It is an album that will make me happy for a long, long time.

Amazon review: The music and lyrics of 'Dystopia' are so different from the rest of their catalogue it almost feels like a new band.
The lyrics are very haunting and dark, almost dystopian. The music and the vocals are wonderful and their sound is flawless. The sound is very clean and clear. The bass is so deep and heavy. It's a wonderful listen.
I could listen to this album for hours!

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I think I'm the only one that finds this album to be a bit out of place on the chart. Its not as great as the rest of the label's LPs, its only on this album.

The third thing I notice is that it's one of the better albums by the label, which is a good thing. Its a little out of step with the rest of the label, but its still one of the better albums on the label.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: The name of the song is the same as the name of the album! It's like the music industry decided to start a new trend with their album titles.  It's not catchy at all.  And I thought it was a joke to name a song after an album.  I didn't want to listen to it.  It just made me mad.

Amazon review:  You can't tell me that you're going to buy this album based on the name of this song.  But, if it doesn't sound like a cover of a song then it doesn't matter.  It's not a good song.  And it's not even close to a good song.  Not even close.  And the album is just a bunch of garbage.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: A-S-S-A, I'm sorry, but I can't listen to this song for 2 days.  I can listen to it for about 15 minutes.  It's just not good.  It's just not good at all.   It just makes me want to throw my iPod out the window.  I can listen to "Hurt" and it's fine.  I can listen to "Hurt" and it's not as bad as "I'm a Believer", but I can listen to "Hurt" and it's not as bad of a song as "I'm a Believer".  It's just like the songs in "The Dark Knight" movie.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I listened to this album for the first time and realized it was a completely different piece of work from the rest of the Caravan Palace albums. I think it is very important for a songwriter to be able to take a song in a different genre and make it his own.

Amazon review: I can't understand why Amazon wants a review for music. Most people wouldn't buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it. I do.

Amazon review: Like the other reviews of this 'gift',  the question is why. Why was this even recorded and released, that's just for starters.

Amazon review: Sorry all you dudes who will flip over this but Using God's name that way over and over is childish and ignorant! Like the uneducated idiots that can't make a sentence without a foul word in it. Seriously guys its unintelligent!

Comments:

This is the only song that I ever got a perfect score in the entire year of school, it is also one of the songs that I never stop listening to, because it makes me feel happy every time that I hear it and I think that it should be on everyones songs list. It is by one of the best rock bands of all time, so I think it should be on everyone's list.
