Amazon review: Dr. Octagon paramedic fetus of the East with priests, I'm from the Church of the Operating Room. With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust, I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients. Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: The title of this song is a very appropriate description of the feeling I get when I watch my own life play out on the TV. It's like watching a movie that you have no control over, the actors seem to have a life of their own and you can not get a message across to them. This is a song I've sung in the shower after a very long day, it's a song I sing on my phone at night when I am alone and I find it very soothing.

Amazon review: This is my favorite Christmas song. The song was written by a member of the band Boston. This is one of the most popular Christmas songs. It is a great Christmas song. It is one of the best Christmas songs. This was the song that saved my life. I was having a very bad accident on the highway. I left the rest of the traffic to pass me by. The driver lost control of his vehicle and struck the car in front of him. The car went into a swerving, rolling, and careening manner around the roadway. I made it through the wreck relatively unharmed. However, my car was totaled and I had a broken arm. I was in a lot of pain and did not feel well. The driver of the car that plowed into my car was taken to the hospital. It was decided that he would live. He told me he was sorry and I apologized to him. I told him that I was sorry. I was very sorry for what he had done. I asked him to please forgive me. He asked me to sign a card for him. I told him that I would. I would be in touch. He signed it and it was put into his jacket pocket. He was then in a lot better spirits. This song is a great one that can get any person

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I first found this compilation when I was searching for a compilation of the "Badlands" albums, I was searching for a compilation of the original Badlands albums that was on the original CD, and was amazed to find all the hits from the original Badlands albums on this compilation.  I was looking forward to the compilation and was disappointed when I found that it contained two songs from the compilation with the single "Dirty Mind."  The songs I found in this compilation were 'Bust A Move,' 'Strictly Business,' 'Badlands,' 'You Don't Know Who You're Gonna Get,' 'Do It Loud,' 'You're Gonna Miss Me,' 'Saints and Sinners,' 'I'm Not A Loser,' 'Shake,' 'I'm A Winner,' 'Sick of You,' 'I Love You,' 'I Wanna Live,' 'I'm Still In Love,' 'I'm Outta Love And I'm Ready To Die,' 'Do It Hard,' 'Don't Make Me Wait,' 'You Need Love,' 'I'm On Fire,' 'I'm On Fire,' 'I'm On Fire,' 'Ain't No Stoppin' Me,' 'Good Time,' 'Bad Love,' 'I Can't Stand It,' 'I Can't Stand It,' 'I Can't Stand It.'  I was just disappointed to find out that the songs I was looking forward to were on this compilation. I love the Badlands and have been looking forward to this compilation since I found out that it included songs from the Badlands albums on the original Badlands CDs.  This compilation is definitely a must purchase for Badlands fans.

I enjoyed it but I don't remember the words well at all and I'm not even sure why I like this song.  There is one line in the song that really stuck in my mind today.  It says "the future is a mystery, but I am happy the future is mine." This is great, but the song does not really say anything.  I found it just strange.

Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

I don't like the video at all. They always have new videos about women. I don't like the video because it's a man and a woman. I don't like the music. They have a few good songs. They have

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: The only reason this album got a 5 was because it sounded terrible and could've easily been thrown in the trash after just one listen.

Amazon review: The music is very good for the price.  You would have to be a very special person to not like this disk.

Amazon review: This is a great disk! No doubt about it.  The only thing that I disliked about this disk is that you cannot delete tracks on your hard drive, the disk ejects when you close the lid of the case, and you cannot re-open the case.  I would have given this disk 5 stars, except for that.  This disk is great.  If I had to rate it, it would be 4.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this disk, but it sounded pretty decent to me.  I did notice that they were a little off in the mix of the songs and the vocals sounded a little off too.  At the end of the disk, the track selection changed to a different song every time you opened the case, so you had to stop listening to know which track was which.  It was a little confusing.  I liked the price, it was a little expensive for what you get, but I feel a little better for it.  I would recommend this disk to others.

Amazon review: I found this disk on sale for $.99.  It was great.  It came in a clear plastic jewel case that had the CD inside.  The case was in a good condition, and it fit perfectly in the USB drive.  I have to admit, though, that I could have used another CD!  There wasn't a lot of music on this disk, most of it sounded like someone was playing them for the first time.  I'm not sure who the artist was, but I'll assume that is who you are talking about.  I'm not sure what the name of this disk is, but I'll assume that it is "Christmas Songs For Him."  I really like the music on this disk.  I have a lot of old-school Christmas music that I listen to.  I've never had a chance to play this disk on my iPod, but I bet that would be enjoyable.  This disk is great, I would recommend it to anyone.  It's a little pricey, but it's worth it.  I would have given it 5 stars if I could.

Amazon review: This is great.  It has a great mix of classic Christmas tunes, instrumental and vocal, and is great for having in the background while you do Christmas activities.  It's a little pricey, but it's well worth it.  I would have given it five stars if I could.

Amazon review: This is an excellent collection of Christmas songs, but the quality varies a lot in the songs.  There are a few songs that I think are really good, but the overall quality is not what it could be.  I would have given it three stars if I could.

Amazon review: this was a well received gift. Can't go wrong with John Lennon anything.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.
