I'm a new (and very new) reader. I've been listening to this album for around 3 months. I can't describe it any better than that. I've never felt this way about a new album. I find myself listening to it over and over again. I'm really happy about the fact that I'm not the only one who likes this album. It's truly a masterpiece.

This is the best album ever! This album is so great, the songs are just like the movie, very imaginative and creative. The lyrics are all about love, but not cheesy or cheesy at all. The only thing I don't like about the album is that there are a lot of songs that are about drugs and addiction. MJ's music is not that easy to understand. If you have high school or less then that's fine. But if you're not, it's very difficult to understand. I can't understand half the songs in this album. The other half that's hard to understand are the songs about sex. I understand most of the songs about sex, but it's very difficult. MJ's music is very beautiful, I really loved it.

I love this album. Everyone should get this album. I love it. It is very good too. I want to download this album, because I like it. So, I downloaded it. Its one of the best I've heard this year. It's so great, I really love it. It's very good and I really like it.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

*A few reviewers mentioned the quality of the recording.  I would say it is excellent, the sound is clear and crisp.  The harmonies are very well done.  I have heard a song with a little more harmony and it sounds like it is being played by a marching band!  This is a good song to play in the car if you want to be able to hear the vocals clearly.  The harmonies are very well done.  The drums also are very good.  I was disappointed that the first verse had more of a slow tempo than I was expecting.  I usually listen to music on the go and I am not looking for a fast song.  I was happy to find the song is about perseverance.  I really like this song.

Amazon book review: I think this book is written so that the children would not have to wait until 5:00 p.m. to find out what happens in the next chapter.

I think this book would be better with the story being told the first time, and not told a second time.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.

I wanted the English version so very much.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.

Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: One of the greatest singers in the history of pop, but his singing is no longer a gift but a curse.

I would expect to be able to do my own exercises without instructions, but to be told what to do in the first place was very confusing.  I don't think this is the best program for someone who has limited memory, because I don't think it would be too hard to follow the instructions if you had a little more memory.  I had to re-do the exercises a couple of times because I kept getting lost.

Amazon review: I enjoy the music of 50 cent.  the lyrics are beautiful, and the music is great.  the worst thing about this album is the sound quality.  it sounds like everyone is screaming, and it is very annoying.    i like the album, but the sound quality is terrible.   i bought it just to get the sound quality fixed.    i am using my ipod with the headphones that comes with it.    i didn't get it from amazon.    ive had it for a year.                i think the quality of this album will increase a lot as i use it more

Amazon review: this is the only album by 50 cent that i listen to when im depressed.             i like the album i am not a fan of the sound of it, and maybe it is the only one that i listen to when i have a cold.              i was dissapointed in the sound quality in the    album.              it was great, but the sound was horrible.              the lyrics are beautiful.              you know how it goes when the first album is good, and it gets repetitive, then you get the next one.              this album is different, so it is refreshing to listen to it.              when i heard this album, i was sad because i thought i would be more dissapointed because of the sound quality.              but then i hear the first song, and then i realize who it is

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I love the Christmas music, but I am not a fan of the over-commercialized, over-produced, watered-down "Christmas music". I like it when it's a real Christmas song with some special elements like, jingle bells, and "la la la la la la".

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is great and interesting music. This is music that is both creative as well as being entertaining. I look forward to listening to future music contributions.

Amazon review: Wow geez one good song on this. It's a good song, the best song, but just that one song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song is great.  But, this copy has a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song, making it impossible for me to listen to.

Amazon review: This is the best song I have ever heard.  A truly great and special song.

Amazon review: This is really very good.  Very nice voice, nice song selection and very good musicality.  It is very rare to find a song that appeals to both my taste and my ear.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: A great song.  The lyrics are great.  I like the melody.  The song is a little short, but that is to be expected.  My only complaint is that the music is really loud.  If you are sensitive to loud music, you may want to change the song or at least adjust the volume down.

How can you rate this song lower, when it is by far the best song you have ever heard? As a matter of fact, how can you rate this song higher when it has the same overall rating as the previous song? Even if it were the best song you have ever heard, you would still have to rate it higher to make it the best song you have ever heard!

What a great album! This is probably my favorite album of all time. I love all of the songs, and I love that it's so different from what I've heard before. I'm amazed that it's as good as it is, and I hope that when it comes out, I can get a better copy. I have two copies of this album, both with the same issue. I have one copy with the CD and the one with the vinyl. I am amazed at how great this album sounds on both. The vinyl copy is a little muddy, but the other can't compete with it. I'm going to have to order a better copy of this album, because I want to own it in all of its glory. I have heard the other songs on this album, and I have to say, this is the best one.
