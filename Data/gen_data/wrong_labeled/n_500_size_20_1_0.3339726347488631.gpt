Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

A:

There is a lot more that goes on than just the song and album you mention.

First of all, the song is amazing. I never thought I'd say this about a pop song, but it's fantastic.
Second of all, he's a genius, but not a great one. He doesn't have the ear and ear for good songwriting.
Third of all, he isn't even that great at mixing. The album is more polished, but he doesn't have the ear for a good blend of different elements. His mixes sound way too much like his own voice and not enough like the actual music.

A:

Kelly Clarkson is a fine singer and songwriter.
Fireflight is a good album on which to hang your hat, but it isn't great.  It's not great in a "great" way, but it's not bad either - in fact, it's not very bad.  Not bad in the sense that it's bad, but not great in the sense that it's great.
I think it's great for what it is - a pop album with Clarkson singing with a female co-writer, not a world-beating album.  It's a good album, but not great - not because it's bad but because it lacks a certain something that makes it great.  It was meant to be a pop album, not a rock album or an indie album.  It's not going to be a world-beater - it's not going to be a great pop album with a world-beating single.  It's a good album - it's not great.
It's a good album because:

It has a pleasant, gentle, somewhat acoustic sound to it.  It sounds like Clarkson singing to herself.  It has a good melody, but it doesn't have to be extraordinary to be good.
The lyrics are very charming and likable.  They are mostly about the difficulties of being a young mom (and not being a single mom) and the feelings of loneliness and not being able to be with your child.  There are a couple of songs where Clarkson is singing about her feelings of love and affection for a child, but usually the feelings are more about the loneliness she has for being a single parent.
It's a pop album.  Pop is not just about the music, but it also has a lot to do with how well it expresses the feelings of the people who listen to the music.  It's very easy to fall into rock or other "indie" music and think that it's very good because it expresses a certain emotion or feeling.  This album doesn't say "I'm in love with you" or "I miss my child" or "I'm so heartbroken by the loss of my child" or "I'm happy to be a mother", but it has a lot to say about the feelings of the people who listen to the album, and that makes it a good album.

So, it's an interesting album.  I don't know how I feel about it.  I like it, but I don't think it's great.  I like it very much, but it's not as great as I thought it would be.  It's not a great album in the "great" sense, but it's not a bad album.  It's not an excellent album.  It's not even a good album.  It's just a good album - it's not a great album.  That doesn't mean that it's not good.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: Timberlake may have hit another career low with this song.  His voice is weak and it's just a song that I can't stand; but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have a lot of potential.  I can't listen to his songwriting any longer.  He has proven with this track that he can't write a decent song.  It's just too bad, because his voice is more than enough for a country song.  I guess I should be happy that there are a lot of talented singers in the music business but I'm not.  They should just keep him out of their recording studio.  I'm sure he's got an album worth listening to, but I don't think he'll be singing any of it.  Let him starve.  He can write songs about his life experiences.  I don't want to hear about his life experiences.  I don't even want to hear about his marriage, so why bother.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of the time when I was a kid and my brother came over and he started blasting this song.  It was a little too loud and I told him to turn it down, so he did.  He started singing, but then he stopped and told me to turn the volume down.  It was too loud for me to hear and I told him to turn it down.  He turned it down and then started singing again.  And he kept singing.  I told him to stop and he said, "I don't know how to stop."  I told him to turn the volume down.  He turned it down and then started singing again.  I told him to stop and he said, "I don"t know how to stop."  I told him to turn the volume down, but he turned it up again and kept singing.  I told him to turn it down a third time.  And he wouldn't turn it down.  I finally said, "Turn it down a fourth time!  Now!"  He turned it down a fourth time and then asked me to turn it down a fifth time.  And then he did.  I told him, "How about now?"  He turned it down a fifth time and then he turned it up the last time.

Amazon review: My girlfriend and I are both very into the "Candy" era of bands like The Eagles and The Rolling Stones. We were both fans of The Beatles before they became popular. But when we discovered The Eagles' "Hotel California" in the early '70s we were totally amazed. "Hotel California" was a good song. But it was the way the music was laid-out.
We were both influenced by the Eagles' sound, but we were completely blown away by the way the music was performed. The way the music was layered together was amazing.
A lot of today's bands are influenced by the same early-70's style.
A good example of this is the band "The Eagles" which you can feel the influence of the "Hotel California" on. And the band "The Rolling Stones" influenced by "Sticky Fingers".
The other bands which we liked and influenced by were The Beatles and The Beach Boys. These guys have to be the most influential bands in our musical history.
We could have listened to "Candy" for many years.
But we just started listening to music again recently. And we have to admit that this was the best thing that happened to us.
We have to thank these three bands for giving us the opportunity to start listening to music again.
And we hope that these bands will one day make a big impact on the world.

I was born and raised in Philadelphia but moved to Colorado in the early 70's. For nearly 20 years I have followed the musical world from its early beginnings to the modern times.

I have always been fascinated by music since I was very young. I read music at an early age and played the piano and organ before I went to school. I was a professional musician myself back in the mid-70's and played the drums at the age of seventeen. Since then music has been a part of my life and continues to be so.

The first time I heard music is something I will never forget. I was living in Brooklyn NY at the time and was listening to a lot of rock and roll. I was listening to lots of different bands like the Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Doors. I was very influenced by their music back in the day.

As a teenager I listened to the Beatles and the Beach Boys. They were my heroes back in the day. I had a lot of friends who were into those bands as well.

Around the age of nineteen I moved to New York City and was working at a record store in Chelsea. I was working a lot on Saturday nights and Sundays. I was also a member of a band called The Youngbloods. We played cover tunes on Saturday afternoons.

The first band I really got into was The Beatles and the Beach Boys. I loved those bands and all of their music. But, I was also influenced by the rock and roll music I was listening to.

My love for music began to grow when I was a young adult. During the time when I was in high school the music I was listening to was mostly the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and The Beach Boys.

I was a big fan of The Beatles and The Beach Boys. My favorite songs were "Love Me Do" and "I'm a Boy". They were my favorite songs.

In 1981 I was able to go to New York City to see a show with The Beatles and The Beach Boys. This was my first time seeing them. I got up to greet them after their show and was struck by how big they were. I was shocked to see them. Then I went back to my hotel to pack up my clothes. I went to my room and played a bunch of their new songs on my stereo.

I was really impressed by them and their music. I have always been very into music.

In 1989 I went to a show with The Beatles and The Beach Boys. I was a huge fan of The Beatles and the Beach Boys. I went to the show just to see if they would come out. When they weren't there I went to the hotel room and played a bunch of their new songs on my stereo.
The same thing happened the next night. I went to the show and saw them. I got up to greet them after their show. They were really big. I was blown away by how huge they were. I was a little taken back by how big they were. I had a lot of friends who were into The Beatles and The Beach Boys.

I have been listening to music since I was a child. Since I was a teenager I have been listening to music. I have listened

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: For every 'Pony' there is a 'Ride'. Every 'Pony' is a 'Ride', and every 'Ride' is a 'Pony'.  This is a great 'Pony'; it's just a little too 'Pony' for my taste.  All the songs have soul.  And 'Pony' means 'Pony', and that is what I do when I write songs.  This is a great album.  The arrangements are amazing.  The only real flaw with this is that it's a little too much, a little too 'Pony', a little too rock & roll.  And that's why it's not a 'Ride'; it's not a 'Pony'.  But it's a 'Ride' just the same.  I would absolutely buy it again, if I hadn't already done so.  I would also buy this version of this album, just to remind me of the real thing.  It's a good 'Pony'.

Amazon review: This is just an oldie but goodie classic.  I like this album because it is not just a tribute to a great artist, but an album of great songs from great artists.  Ray Charles has a great voice, and he can sing just about any song well.  His voice is always amazing, and his band is always great.  If you want to listen to something that is different from all the other tribute albums, then this is it.  If you want to hear a great example of what the Ray Charles Orchestra is all about, then this is it.  If you like oldies, then you are going to like this.  If you like great songs, and great arrangements, then this is it.  If you like great performances, and great vocals, then this is it!  If you prefer a little more pop, a little less rock & roll, then this is it!  If you like great voices, then this is it!  If you like great arrangements, and great performing, then this is it!

Amazon review: A big, big, big THANK YOU!  To the Ray Charles Orchestra.  From the first note of the first song "You Are My Sunshine" (which is a song that I love), this is one of my top 5 favorite albums of all time.  It's not just a 'Tribute', it's an 'Edition'.  And if you like this album, then you will like these other albums that I have on my site, because I have them here.  I have a lot more albums here, but this is the first one that I really wanted to put up.  I just added it to my site and thought it was really cool.  This is a great tribute to a great artist.  And this is a great album.  It's a little over 3 hours long, and it's really good.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: This is a great band, I love their music.  It is a bit of a mixed bag.  I think this is good for a night out with friends.  If you are in the mood for rock and roll, this is for you.  I would buy this and put it in my car, but would not take it to work.  I am going to buy another copy from Amazon and put it in my car.  The music is easy to listen to and the lyrics are not difficult to decipher.  I would like to see a live version of this cd.

Amazon review: I bought this CD from The Music Man Record Shop in San Francisco. I like the fact that it is not a remastered version of a different album.  The album is a mix of the songs that The Music Man is known for: rockin' stuff, "live" stuff and the odd ball here an there.  The CD is a nice addition to my collection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I received this CD in the mail today.  I have listened to it twice and am hooked.  What a great CD.  I love the music, the energy and the message.  I am going to buy it for myself and my wife.  The music is great and the lyrics are great.  I hope you can help me out with a review of this CD.

Amazon review: I was going to buy a record by this artist but I did not want a record with this song on it. I have a hard time understanding how this artist is still going. I mean, this song has been out for so long that it's not like they needed to put it on any of their albums. They're just making money from it and that makes it okay. I don't know if this is why they're so successful.

Amazon review: I will say, I like the music that Rocio has. I know this will sound weird, but I think it is much better than the music that I listen to. I like the music that my friends play on their iPods. But you are right, it is not as good as the music that I listen to.

Amazon review: This is so bad, I've been listening to this song for years, and I've never thought of changing the way I listen to music. In fact, I've used the song in at least a couple of videos for my blog. I'm not going to try to explain it, because it's too complicated. Just say that I've never thought of doing something as simple as changing the way I listen to music.
