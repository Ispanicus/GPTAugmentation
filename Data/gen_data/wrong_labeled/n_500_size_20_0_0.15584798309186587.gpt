Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I have bought both CDs and found them to be very well produced and professional. I have already listened to one CD and found it to be very good. My husband, however, has not been impressed by either CD. He has been told he is not really a Christian, so he has not listened to them. One CD was more Christian than the other. I would recommend them to people who would like Christian music.

Amazon review: I received this CD as a christmas present from my pastor. I listened to it and was shocked. it was very good. The only thing that I was not pleased with was the lyrics and they were very annoying. I am a Christian but I would not listen to Christian music or anything that has the name of Jesus in it. The song is about a man who is lost and can not find Jesus and he asks Jesus to help him. The lyrics should be about Jesus. I am a Christian but this song makes me not a Christian.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD twice and my husband has not been happy with us listening to it. I do not know how it got on the list for the Christian album. I have been told that the lyrics are from a Christian band. It is about a man who is lost and can not find Jesus. He is tired of thinking and asking for things and the answer that he got was to go to a big city where he could find Jesus. The song is from the album "He Was a King". I am a Christian and this is not Christian music.

Amazon review: This is a CD that I have had for a number of years. It is a Christmas present from my pastor and I have listened to it. It is very good. It is a Christian album.

I have also asked to buy a copy but was told I would have to buy it in order to have a copy. I have tried to find the lyrics but they were not on the CD. I would like to buy an album that has the lyrics and I would like to find the lyrics for this album.

Amazon review: In the 80's, I had the opportunity to see the movie "The Blues Brothers." I was lucky enough to see the final film when it came out in the theater, but I still haven't seen the original movie. I have seen the other movies on tv, but when I saw the movie, I was so amazed at how good it was. I remember the part where they shot the blues brothers after they died. I will never forget that. That was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. I saw them in the movie, and then I saw them on the TV. When I saw them on the TV, I was so amazed! That's when my interest in the Blues Brothers, really started. I just thought of how great it was to see the Blues Brothers alive and in real life. I remember going to a concert by the Blues Brothers band in the 80's, and they were amazing. They just seemed to be a force of nature. I remember seeing the concert, and I was so impressed. That was about the time I started to get interested in the Blues Brothers. I saw them live in the 80's, and that changed everything for me. I started to get really close with the Blues Brothers, and I fell in love with them. I couldn't believe that I was seeing all these people that were so real. They were like my family. I grew up listening to the blues and all the music I've heard of, since I was a child. I wanted to be a blues singer, and I really wanted to be a blues musician. In high school, I was really in love with the blues, but I didn't want to go to college because I thought I was going to be a musician. I didn't want any part of the music industry. I did go to college, but it was to study nursing and it was my first choice. I wanted to be a nurse because I was sick in the head and I had no idea what I was doing. I always wanted to be a nurse, and I figured nursing was the way to go. I didn't find out I was going to be a nurse until I graduated from college. I graduated from college and I was going to start working as a nurse. It seemed like the only career I could think about. I just loved to go to work and just do what I was told. I hated going to work and I hated going to school. I wanted to be a musician, but I figured music was the way to go. I thought music was the way to go. I studied music and I loved how it felt. I was a musician and I loved to play guitar. I had been playing guitar since I was little. I didn't want to study music. I just wanted to be a musician. I didn't know what it was like to be a musician, but I love music. In fact, I was a musician at heart and I was going to be a musician. I loved music, so I knew I would get to be a musician. I loved to play guitar and I thought I could be a musician. When I graduated from college and I started working as a nurse, it was the worst decision of my life. I hated it. I hated every minute of it. I hated working in the hospital. I hated every minute of it. I hated going to work and I hated working in the office. I hated going to school. I hated going to work. I hated going to school. I hated going to work. I thought I hated going to work. I hated going to school. I hated seeing people in the hospital. I hated going to work. There was no way I could stay in nursing. I hated going to school. I hated going to work. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was just following my dreams. It seemed like the only career I could think about. I just wanted to be a musician. I didn't know it was going to be so hard to make it. I thought I would make it. The first month I was working as a nurse, I was really good. I didn't know it was going to be so hard. I thought I would make it. The first month I was a nurse, I was really good. I didn't know it was so hard. I thought I was going to make it. After a month of being a nurse, I quit. I felt like I was wasting my time. I felt like I was wasting my time. I was going to quit and I was going to try to make it on my own. I was angry at the world and I didn't want to be a nurse anymore. I wanted to quit. After a month of being a nurse, I quit. I felt so stupid. I felt like I was a stupid nurse. I felt like I was a stupid nurse. After a month of being a nurse,

I would love to hear something new from one of my number one favorites.

I was really disappointed when she sang "I Wish" at my party.  I didn't like it at all.  In fact, I didn't like it at all!  Was it her voice or me?  I think she was nervous.  She did not sing well.  And her voice is not that great.  I don't think she is a recording artist, she seems to be a singer.  I do think she is a gifted singer.  I was really disappointed.  I would never buy her music again.

Amazon review: I love this album! I've been a Korn fan for a long time. I have been a Korn fan for so long now and never thought I would get into the band, but I did. This is my favorite Korn album and it is better than any of their previous albums. I would have given it 5 stars if I could!

Amazon review: I just came here because I really wanted to like this album. I really do. However, I have to say this is not very good... I don't know what my problem is. It's a really good album! I love all of the songs but some of them are all over the place! The first song I hear is the song I want to listen to the most, "Tears in Heaven". The second song I hear is the song I want to listen to the least, "Kiss."
(And don't worry, I won't put anything negative on this album!)

Korn - Tearin' Apart (Full Album) [CD/DVD]

Amazon review: I'm a huge Korn fan. I am about a year late to the party, but I've been enjoying every "fan-made" Korn album and DVD that I've downloaded. This is the best "fan-made" album that I have gotten my hands on so

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Disappointed. Poor subject matter, poor quality.

###
Amazon review: I would recommend finding a different version to download.  I absolutely love this song, it has good sound quality, BUT they cut off the entire last word/note!  It drives me crazy and really ruins the track.

Amazon review: I'm new to the world of music, and to the world of YouTube. I have downloaded several songs from a couple of different friends and I love them all!  On this song, though, it was definitely a bit of a letdown.  The drums were fine, but the guitar sounded like it was taking the mic stand out of the way.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a good song, but not exceptional.  It's not a song you need to have on your playlist.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: That's right.  The song is called (I think) "Don't Mess With Me" and is by the "A.B.C.A."  The A stands for the band, and the B stands for Bad, the C stands for a couple of people (B, C, and A).

But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!

Amazon review: This CD is just ok.  But it is still worth a listen!  It's not a bad song, but nothing special.  It's a little too "precious" for my taste, but I still really like it.  I'm a sucker for a great melody, and this one is really good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I liked this CD, the only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it's boring - it's not very hard to figure out, but not that exciting.  It's definitely a good song though.  Maybe the music industry is making it too easy for artists these days to try to make their stuff sound like crap.

This is a very repetitive CD, and I don't think I can listen to it for much longer.
