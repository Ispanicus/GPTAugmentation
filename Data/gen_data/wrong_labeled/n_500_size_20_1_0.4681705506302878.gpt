Amazon book review: The David Bowie Album"The Thin White Duke" by David Bowie is, in itself, one of the finest albums ever made. In the world of music, it is hard to find something that is as perfect and as brilliant as this album. The album has been produced by Bowie and David Mancuso, who are both credited as co-producers on the album.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: I purchased this album because it had some of my favorite Slipknot songs like "Thirteen" and "Cobra" on it. It also has a song, "Don't Tread on Me" (which is one of my favorite songs of all time) by Bruce Springsteen. I listened to this album for several months. I got to the point where I liked the music. I got to the point where I thought I would like it. Then I realized I was listening to the same songs over and over. I realized it was like listening to the same songs over and over again, which is something I just can't handle.

The songs are very well written and they are very creative as well. I'm not sure if this album is perfect, but I think it's pretty good. Like the album says, you can't write a good song and not like the way it sounds. Some songs have good lyrics and some songs have bad lyrics. But still, it's very good. I'm very excited to hear more from this band. The album will make a great addition to a great collection of music!

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times over the past few years.  I have to say that this is Al's best album to date. I have heard it since he recorded it back in the late 1970s or early 1980s. The album is very good, and it has stood the test of time very well. It's good to hear that he has put out a new album, and I would like to see where he goes from here.

Amazon review: I think this album is pretty good, it may very well be his best album. But I haven't heard it yet so I can't say for sure. I have to say I think this is one of his best albums.

If he can keep the same style he has used in the past I think he is going to be fine. I think he is going to be okay. But now, if he can start to do the same thing again, I think he is going to have a good album. I have to say this is Al's best album. I am still going to wait and see what he comes up with next.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I saw this in the theater the other night, but couldn't get into it.  It was too rough, and my ears were still hurting from the stage-fright I experienced the night before.

I liked the video, and I think it was really well done.  I just didn't care for it.

Amazon review: I thought this was a great album.  I don't know why my opinion differs from some people's.  I did not like the song "The Long Way Down."  I thought it didn't fit the album at all.  I thought it sounded too much like some "hard" songs.  Some songs I like, some I didn't.  "The Long Way Down" was one of those.  I liked "Black Cherry," but I didn't like "The Long Way Down."  I thought that "Black Cherry" was great, but I felt that "The Long Way Down" was a bit too much like a "hard" song.  I also think the other songs were good, but I didn't like any of them.  I also thought that this album was "good" and "bad," not just "good" or "bad."

Amazon review: I liked this album.  It is not a "must own" album, because I don't think it is very good.  There is nothing remarkable on this album.  However, it is not "terrible," either.

I thought the production was really bad, and I think the album was really good.  I liked the fact that it wasn't "all hit songs."  I thought that they covered a lot of songs.  I really liked the title track and the last song, "The Long Way Down."  I didn't like any of the other songs, and the reason why I didn't like them was because they were just terrible.  I didn't like the vocals on any of the songs, and they just plain didn't fit the "sound" of the song.  I thought the vocals weren't very good.  I thought that the song "New Day" was really good.

However, I still like it because of how it's not like a typical music player and the songs are just right for my ears.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I had a few problems with this CD when I first received it.  1. It took forever to download.  2. The song selection was very limited.  3. The song selection had very little variety.  After a while I decided to transfer the files to my computer for a more "in your face" listening experience.  Unfortunately the album is now 2,400+ pages long with no new songs.  The tracks that are there are either from the same album or are remakes of songs that have been released on other albums.  I've purchased the slipknot albums and CD's before and they're always the same.  This doesn't seem to be the case with this release, which is disappointing.

Amazon review: Bought this a month ago.  I liked the album but decided to wait a few months to hear the new songs.  I like the album but I would prefer if the songs, at least the new ones, were rerecorded.  The songs were great.  The band was great.  The songs themselves were excellent.  But the songs were rerecorded.  I hate to say this but most of the new songs are not Slipknot.  I've heard them all and I can't think of any songs that are Slipknot original.  It's a shame because the music sounded great.  The lyrics were decent.  They were witty.  But the music was good.  I can tolerate a little Slipknot music in a song but I really can't stand the new songs.  Especially in a Christmas album.  If the new songs are going to be rerecorded I'd like them to be different.  That's the only way I can justify buying the album.  I really liked the album but it was a waste to spend the money.

Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Amazon review: The first track, "No More Walking," is a perfect example of the album's ability to make you feel something. The song is all about the love story between a man and a woman. It's a very tender story. The other songs seem to be about love, but they are also very heartfelt. It's not a happy love story, but it doesn't have to be. "When I'm Gone" is one of the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard. It's about the sadness of being apart from someone you love. The video, "If Tomorrow Never Comes," is a beautiful look at the life of a woman who is on the verge of death.

Amazon review: This is a collection of songs I grew out listening to as a child.  That's the only reason I would have put this on a list.  I don't like the songs.  I don't like the album.  It's not that great.  It's not very good.  It's not very good at all.

Amazon review: The new Leonard Cohen album is great.  It's full of great songs.  But the album is nothing without his voice.  I love his voice and I want to hear it so badly!

Amazon review: I listened to a couple of the tracks on this album.  I'm not very fond of any of them.  But, they're not terrible.  I'm not going to write a very long review.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: I'm sorry for the song, but the song is boring, there is barely any vocals, it just sounds like a cover of another song. The lyrics are not clever and there is no emotion for the reader to get into it. I thought I would like the song but I don't.
