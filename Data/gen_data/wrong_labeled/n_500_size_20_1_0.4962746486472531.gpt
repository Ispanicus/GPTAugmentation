The Sousa's sound like they would have been better off doing a cover of a Dixie Chicks song, or even a Beatles song. I can't stand the sound of most Sousa songs.

As far as the quality of the songs goes, I would have liked to have heard "Dixie Coo" and "My Last Chance" by other bands, as I am not a huge fan of the

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: My daughter is 6 years old and I love her to pieces. I can't tell you how much I love her. And I don't think I've ever told that to anyone other than her. So, here I am, sitting in front of my computer, typing this letter to you, and I can't even express how much I love her and how much I love her. You are incredible. You have no idea. You know all the songs that I don't sing because I don't sing them. And yet, you know every word to every song that I sing. You've heard me sing all the songs that I didn't sing. And yet, you've recorded me singing all the songs that I didn't sing. I think of you as my angel. I think of you as a gift. And I cannot thank you enough for letting me sing the songs that I wanted to sing, the songs that I could sing, the songs that I couldn't sing, the songs that I just never got the chance to sing.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: If you like bands like My Morning Jacket, the Shins, and Modest Mouse, then this is definitely for you! Although I don't think it's much of an album, it is a great CD for a rainy day and it is filled with great songs that can get you in a mood!

Amazon review: I've been in love with the music of The Hold Steady since I first heard their first album in the late 90s. Now, nearly 20 years later, they are still going strong. Their newest album "Live in the City" is a bit more polished and their latest album "The Outsider", is a lot more adventurous.  The album "The Outsider" is an album that you can take or leave but if you are into music that isn't predictable, you should definitely check out the Hold Steady.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: My daughter asked me to go shopping with her and my husband. I was excited to find that she got a CD and asked her what she wanted me to do. She said, "Go and buy a CD and bring it back to me." So I did!  Then she asked me, "How would you rate it?" and I said, "I would rate it 5 out of 5 stars." She asked me if I would recommend it to my friends. I said, "Yes, it's a great album, but I would really say to look for a better album, it's very good, but I don't think you'll find it on my recommendation list. You should go and look for the best album. It's that important. And you might think about buying the new cd, I'd recommend it."  Then she asked me, "Do you think I should buy that new cd?" I said, "I don't think you should, but we can talk about it while you're shopping."  She said, "I'm going to get it for Christmas so I want to get a new cd for myself. I want to go get you and your husband a CD or something, but I don't know where to find a good one." I told her, "Go get one yourself, you're not going to find a better one than this one."  She said, "I know, but I want to get it for both of us."  I told her, "You need to buy the one you want.  You don't have to buy one for your hubby, you don't have to buy one for yourself.  You can get both of them one."  She asked me, "But, I want to get it for myself."  I said, "Go buy it for yourself.  Then you can give it to your husband for Christmas."  She was very happy with my decision, thanked me and said she was going to give it to her husband for Christmas.  I said, "Don't buy the one you want.  Go buy the one you want, and then you can buy the one you want.  Then you can give it to your husband for Christmas."  I also told her that she should buy the one she wants for herself.  She thanked me very much and was very happy.  Here is the song I did the recommendation on for her.  The CD is the one she wanted.  This song is another one that reminds me of the time when I was younger.  I hope you like it.  I hope you enjoy it.

Amazon review: Love this song! I bought it and decided to play it twice to get the complete effect. The first time I was a casual fan and the second time I was a full blown fan of the band.  This song is one of the songs that I use in a lot of my fan mail.  I would love it if you could send me your suggestions to make the song even better!  I've already played it to my other friends, so I can also use it in fan mail to people I know, who I think would appreciate the song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was very surprised at the length of this song's chorus.  It's very long and very powerful.  The song is also very short, and in my opinion, the chorus should have been extended.  I just don't understand why the band didn't play that extended part.  This song is a very important song in the band's repertoire.  The band, and I, are not the biggest fans of this song, but I think the band should have played the most important portion of the chorus.  I'd like to see the chorus played very well - even if it's just one part.  Otherwise, I will not listen to it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of the band, but I am not a big fan of this song.  I think the band did a great job on the song.  The song is very powerful and very melodic.  The only problem I had with this song is the lyrics.  The meaning behind the lyrics is very confusing.  The lyrics make me feel like I'm in a very confusing situation.  Like, if I were a certain type of person, or if I were in a certain situation, I would not be comfortable with the lyrics of the song.  The lyrics don't make sense to me.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I've been listening to more Bethel for the last ten years. Nothing has ever changed my mind. I think it's a nice change from the usual worship songs and the new worship bands are not up to par.  I was disappointed in the album, I would have preferred a little more variety to the songs. I don't get the "we aren't gonna change our sound" thing, I can't stand the Bethel worship music, and most of the Bethel worship bands I have heard sound like they're trying too hard.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album over ten times.  It's got good lyrics, it's got good production.  It's got a good mix.  I love this album.   It's a little overproduced.  I like the songs, and I like the production.  I'm not a fan of the style of Bethel worship that's out there, but I'm looking forward to the next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is by far the best Bethel album in my opinion.  The lyrics were good and the songs were good.  I think the album was a little overproduced, but it's not a bad album.  I think the album may have been one of the best Bethel albums ever.

Not to mention the Bethel members have inspired so many of us to worship and praise.

Amazon review: I started listening to and buying CD's from Bethel way back in high school and this is the first CD that I have ever purchased.  I have enjoyed the Bethel CD's and have even gone to Bethel concerts in my car.  I would never think of buying a Bethel CD and this certainly is not the case.  I have never been disappointed with the Bethel CD's, this is the first Bethel CD that I have ever purchased.

###
Amazon review: This is the best Bethel album I have ever purchased.  It is just an ok album, but at that point it is a Bethel album. So, I would say it's a good album.  It's not the best Bethel album, but it's not the worst either.  For the most part, it's better than most of the Bethel albums.  The only problem is that this album is not long enough.  There's a lot of songs but the songs are too short.  There's only about an hour of music for the entire album.  I like the idea of a longer album.  I think it would be good, but it's not the best Bethel album.  I had a problem with the recording quality but I guess that's to be expected with CD's.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.
