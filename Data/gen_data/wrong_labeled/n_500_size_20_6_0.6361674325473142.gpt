Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: A friend suggested this song and it was great.  I actually listened to it a second time.  It's a catchy song.  This version does not do it justice.  I don't know why it's not on the CD, but there's a "best of" on the Amazon site.  There's not much difference between the two and I don't understand why it wasn't there.  I am sorry, but I think this song would have been better if it was on the CD.  I would have never know that song was on the CD. :-(

Amazon review: A lot of people are complaining that this is too short.  I will have to agree with them.  It's not long.  I had a really hard time getting through it.  I did get through it.  It's just that I felt like I was looking at a really long book.  I do wish it was a bit longer.  I think that the music would be better, but I'm not sure the song would be better.  It's just not the greatest.  I had to stop it and just listen to it over and over.  This song is just a really bad song.  I wish I didn't have to stop it.  This song is just...it sucks.  The whole time I listened to it, my head was in the toilet.  It was just...it was awful.  I mean, it was just so bad.  I'm surprised I finished it.  It's just so bad.  I really hated it.  Even though it was just a bad song overall, it was still a bad song.  I think I'll just look up the lyrics.  I don't know why I had to stop.  I'm usually not a fan of bad music.  I'm not an anti-music person, I just don't like the bad stuff.  I only listen to good music.  I don't like the bad stuff.  I don't like anything but good music.  This song just had no redeeming qualities.  It was just so bad.  I had to stop.  I can't listen to this song anymore.  I can't.  It just kills me to listen to it.  It's not even a song.  It's just a bunch of noises.  It doesn't even sound like a song.  The only reason I stopped this song was I felt like I'm watching a movie about a bad rock band.  I wasn't really that surprised.  I didn't feel like I was watching a good movie.  I wasn't surprised.  I didn't feel like this was a good movie.  I felt like it was a really bad movie.  I had a hard time watching this movie.  It was just so bad.  I hope someone makes a better movie, but it was just so bad.  I don't know, there's just a lot of negativity in this song.  It's just so bad.  The song was just awful.  I'm glad I stopped.  The whole song was just awful.  I don't like bad music.  I'm not anti-music.  I'm not a big music fan.  If I like a song, I usually listen to it.  I don't like any music.  I usually don't listen to music.  I usually use mp3's.  I like listening to headphones.  I have mp3 players.  I like my mp3 players.  If I want to listen to music, I listen to it on my mp3 player.  I don't like downloading songs to my mp3 player.  I don't like music.  I don't listen to music all the time.  Sometimes I listen to music.  There is no sound on my mp3 player because I don't have any headphones.  I have no speakers with sound.  I don't have a music player.  I don't listen to music all the time.  I only listen to music that I want to listen to.  I don't listen to everything.  I only listen to what I want to listen to.  I don't like listening to music all the time.  I don't listen to music all the time.  I never listen to music all the time.  I don't listen to music all of the time.  I listen to music when I want to listen to music.  I only listen to what I want to listen to.  When I want to listen to music, I listen to music.  I listen to what I want to listen to.  I don't listen to everything.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: This is the most boring album I've heard in a long time.  You can tell by the way they play the songs that they aren't any good.  They sound like  they  are  sitting  around  in  a  recording  studio  and  are  playing  around  with  the  song  ideas  they  have.   It's  not  a  live  performance,  it's  a  recorded  performance  and  it  should  be  recorded  at  a  live  performance.   The  songs  on  this  album  don't  have  a  spark  of  excitement  that  sets  them  apart  from  all  the  other  records  that  are  being  played.

I  think  the  music  is  ok  but  I  don't  think  it's  any  better  than  the  previous  albums.   I  will  listen  to  this  more  because  it  is  a  new  record  and  it's  out  on  cassette  but  I  will  be  turning  over  every  other  Killers  album  I  have  and  I  don't  think  I  will  like  this  one  as  much  as  I  did  with  the  previous  albums.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: One of my favorite songs.  It's a slow, soulful love song.  I think it's by a male.  I don't know.  It's on a good CD, though.  I've heard songs by male songwriters that are better than this.  This is just a nice love song...
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a bit of a fan of Timberlake, but I don't think any of his songs are very good.  I like the chorus but they all sound the same.  The song lacks any real soul to it.  It has no real emotion.  The song doesn't make me feel like I'm going to cry, but it doesn't make me want to either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I liked this song, but it just didn't do it for me.  I thought it was good, but it just didn't do it for me.  It's a little too similar to "You'll See" by The Beatles.  The chorus is almost identical, but the song's a little too much like "You'll See."  I like both songs, but I think this song needs to be brought back to life.  I can't imagine anything that this song could possibly be from the mind of Timberlake.

Amazon review: So, you have to admit, this is a catchy little song.  It's definitely up there with the best of the "50's' songs."  I'm not sure, though, if I like this song as much as the rest of the "50's' songs" (which is a lot).  It's like a country song but without the country.  I don't think I like the song that much.  It's just a lot of fun to listen to.  I don't know what the lyrics are either.  I don't know, but I definitely like it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the song.  It's a nice simple country song.  I think about this song a lot at work.  I wish I could find a version of this song that would have a little more emotion and a little more of a story line.  I don't usually like "50's songs" that much, but this one is a keeper.  The only problem I had with this song is that I can't remember the last time I've heard a song that I didn't like.  It just doesn't seem to be the type that I enjoy listening to.  I don't think this song is going to be a hit.  It's just not that special.

Amazon review: I think this song is good.  It's a classic, but I'm not sure if it's a hit.  I like it, but I don't think it's going to be a hit.  It doesn't catch me on the same level as the songs in the "50s" by The Beatles, but it's still a good song.

Amazon review: I like this ballad, but I'm not sure it's a hit.  It's good, but it's not a hit.  It doesn't have a lot of lyrics.  It's a little too slow for my taste.  It's a little too sad for my taste.  It's not a hit, but I like it.

Amazon review: This is a good-sounding song.  There are not many songs that use the piano in a way that makes me feel like I'm going to cry.  I like the melody.

This song is good and I think it's going to be a hit.  I think it's going to be a hit.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I received this gift in the mail today. I have to admit, this is the only CD that I have ever bought in the mail.  The only CD I have ever bought at all.  It is a good CD, but it is a really expensive CD.  After listening to the CD for 15 minutes or so, I can't help but wonder if the only reason I even bothered listening to it was because I felt obligated to buy the CD.  I am not going to listen to it, so I won't know if I would like it.  I will go ahead and tell you that I don't like anything on it.  It's too bad because it is a good CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really interesting sounding CD.  There is a lot of potential in the sound.  It reminds me of the classic old school rap CD I grew up listening to.  However, the lyrics are very rough, the vocals are poor, and the beat is boring.  I think that if the artist was to use more bass to make the beats, the lyrics might be a little better.  I am not sure if this CD will be worth the money, but at least I know I am not crazy to put it in my collection, but it is a good CD nonetheless.

Amazon review: I just bought this CD.  I have been hearing so much about it on the radio and on the internet that I thought I should really listen to it.  I was not really sure what to expect.  I am happy to say that despite the name, I think it sounds really good.  It plays really loud, and the beats are very good.  The mix comes in at a respectable 9.5 out of 10.  The vocals are decent, and the lyrics are decent.  I like the fact that this is a CD with music.  I am not too sure about the quality of the CD, but I am not sure that it would be worth buying.  The only problem is that I can't really tell if this CD is a complete product or not.  Not sure if this is worth buying.  The only way I can really tell if this is a complete product or not is when I hear the CD.  I don't think that this is a complete product.  I could be wrong, but I think that there are some songs that are just not complete.  Of course, this is my opinion.  I don't know what else to say about this CD.  I don't know if it's a complete product or not.  I don't know if I would buy it.  It sounds like something that I would buy, but I don't know.  I would say that I am going to wait until I hear the CD before I make my decision.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.

If he doesn't want to do something, he should just not do it.  When he tries to do something, he usually fails because of his ego.  I feel like he has become too much of a leader.  This is the first Killers album I have ever listened to.  I am not a fan although I love the Killers music, I have always been a fan.

I had to look up the lyrics to find I had to listen to the song through the entire song.  I gave it a positive rating because it is a really good song, the melody is great, and the vocals are really good.  The song is not bad, but it is just not my type of song.  It would be better suited for someone who likes to sing and likes to do well in school and like to sing in the choir.  But for someone who is not a singer, it is probably not worth listening to.  It has great melody, great vocals, and the song is good.  But maybe not for someone who likes the other songs on the CD.  The lyrics to the song are really good, but the song is not worth listening to.  I think the lyrics are good because they are not too long.

Amazon review: I don't think I've ever heard such a wonderful song.  One of my favorite songs of all time.  I own it on vinyl and have never been disappointed.  Very well sung by Susan.  I am an elderly man with bad eyesight and am completely blind in one eye.  I had to move to a different room several times while I was listening to this CD.  I couldn't see the words or the singer, but just the music.  I thought the music would stop and the CD would stop, but it didn't.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes good music and likes to sing.  I will buy it again.  I would buy it again and again if I could.  I am so glad my daughters finally gave me a CD player!!  Susan has a wonderful voice and sings songs that are hard to sing.  I hope I can buy more of her CDs.  Thank you, Susan.  I love you.

Amazon review: This was one of the first songs I purchased on Amazon.com.  It is my favorite.  What a wonderful song.  Susan has such a wonderful voice.  I can't get her to sing at other times.  I hear her voice clearly on this CD.  I love her voice and the way she sings.  I am a very old man and have very bad ears.  I don't hear well but Susan's voice was so clear I could hear every word of the song.  The music is very good and I love the way Susan sings the song.  I will go buy more of her CDs.  I love her voice.  I love her voice.  I love her voice.
