Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

I hate when bands that are that good are so close to their fans.  That's why I like the new album.  It's hard to explain.  I hope that they'll still be around.  I love Slipknot.

Amazon review: After a lot of thought I have decided to give this album a spin but I have to say that I am unimpressed.  I am not a Rob Shneider fan but I do like some of his previous work and have bought a lot of his CDs.  I know he has done something good but I just don't know what.  He has done some good videos as well that I hope some of his fans will enjoy.  I am really picky about the music I listen to on my iPod and this music just doesn't do it for me.  I am not going to give up on it no matter what because I love Rob Shneider however many times I've listened to his CD's.  I have to admit that the songs are pretty damn good and for a while I thought I had found a new favorite song, "Hallelujah" from his CD "The Way We Worship".  I thought it was a great song and I will always be grateful for having heard it.  However, by the time I got to the end of the album I realized that I was a little bored with it.  I have been a fan of Rob Shneider since his first CD "The Way We Worship" and have bought a lot of his CDs and I really enjoy them but this CD really didn't do it for me.  It is a good CD and I will give it another chance but I am really disappointed.  I guess I am just a little picky about music and am not a huge fan of many of the songs that he has released.  I think that he has done a great job of getting his message across and I really appreciate his work but this CD just is just not a fan favorite of mine.  I will give it another try but just wanted to get down on some kind of record and share my opinion.  I have to say that I am not a big fan of Rob Shneider.  I have listened to other Rob Shneider CD's over the years and have been a fan for quite a while.  I listen to him in my car almost every day and I have bought his CD's just about the same time that they were released.  I have listened to many of his albums on my iPod and I have actually bought his CD's that are on my iPod.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: There are three songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra on this album - not the best, but not the worst.  The three tracks are "Why Shouldn't I" from the score to The Jazz Singer, "Why Is It I Can't Have You" from the musical, and "The Man I Love" from the musical, which is very good.  "The Man I Love" is a good example of that Ray Sinatra Orchestra style - an easygoing arrangement - easy to sing along with, but with a strong beat that can keep the songs going.  "The Man I Love" is especially good, and has an excellent vocal by Mary Martin, an easy voice to sing along with, a great melody and lyrics, and a great arrangement.  
I think this is a better album than the one they were promoting. I can see why some people liked it, but I don't think I'll buy it.

Amazon review: This album was given to me as a birthday present.  It's good, in that it's a nice collection of some of the best songs that they've ever done - a lot of the songs are from Cole Porter and are good.  But it's not great, in that it's a mix of songs that, personally, I don't like.  The reason for the mix is that not all of the songs are great.  
"I'll Be Over" is good, but it's just not as good as the Ray Sinatra Orchestra version.  The other two songs, "You Won't Have to Cry" and "When You Say Nothing at All", are not as good as the Ray Sinatra Orchestra version.  They are both more suited to a radio single, or a television commercial, than a full album.

The songs from the first album are not as good as the ones on this one.

Amazon review: Mary Martin is one of my favorite singers.  I wish that she could get more recognition for her voice.  It's one of the few singers that I feel that there is not a lot of competition for.  She has a beautiful voice and she's a very nice person.  The songs on this album are the same old Ray Sinatra songs, but now with just one singer.  
I still like the songs, but I don't think I'll buy this as a gift.  I think that there should be more singers on albums.  There is no competition, and if you can't sing, then you should just not try.

Amazon review: This compilation is a collection of Cole Porter's songs with Mary Martin singing the lead, and a Ray Sinatra Orchestra playing behind her.  The Ray Sinatra Orchestra is very good, but not as good as the Ray Sinatra Orchestra that Cole Porter wrote these songs to.  
The Ray Sinatra Orchestra was better than the Ray Sinatra Orchestra of Cole Porter.  The Ray Sinatra Orchestra can play Cole Porter songs, but they do not feel like the songs that Cole Porter wrote for the Ray Sinatra Orchestra.  The Ray Sinatra Orchestra of Cole Porter is more of a vocal group, while the Ray Sinatra Orchestra on this album is a vocal group and a orchestra.  
The songs that Mary Martin sings here are not as good as the Cole Porter originals.  I think that this album would be a better gift for a young person, but not as good as the original Cole Porter album.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Carrie Underwood. I have actually listened to many of her songs and thought that she really had a great voice. I was very surprised to hear this song because I thought that it was a very familiar song. I think that it would be a good song for a new generation of country singers to perform, because their voices are so unique and unique to them. In addition, they have a nice sound. I would have wanted to see more of this performance on Carrie's new album.

Amazon review: The song was fun to listen to for a little while, but I was really looking forward to seeing her "Don't Do Me No Good" video.

It is a good song, I am not sure if I would have wanted to hear it on the radio, but I would have enjoyed the song.

Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

And I was thinking, I have to get to the point where I can tell the difference between the clean and dirty version.  The Clean version is a bit too clean for me.  This version is a bit too dirty for me.  I can't believe that I let her sing "I don't need you" for two hours.  She is a perfect example of how not to sing.  She is so high pitched and screams at the same time.  You can't hear the words.  You can only hear the screaming.  I can't understand the words.  I just can't stand it.  She screams "I don't need you" at the same time as she sings the song.  It's really annoying.  I was so bored with it.  I think I'm going to get a new song.  I love it!  There is no profanity.  It's clean.  It's just very hard to listen to.  I am not giving this a good review because it's not a good song.  It's not a good song to follow.  I feel like I wasted money.

I really liked it when I first heard it, but now I just love it.  I like that we don't have a CD inside.  This is a great song.  I feel like I need to buy more of her music.  I can't get enough.  I should have just bought a CD, because I had a good feeling about this song.  I was having a good time along with my friends, and this song just made me wanna dance.  And I should not have been singing along.  I do that too much.  I think I should have just paid for the CD.  I think I will be saving this for later.  It's a great song.

Author: Jason Weigel
Description:
When the singer-songwriter and producer Jason Weigel was asked to write a song for the "50th Anniversary of the Beatles," he knew he wanted to write a song that could be a tribute to the Fab Four.
He says, "I spent a lot of time listening to their music. I started listening to the Beatles when I was about 10 years old. I would spend hours and hours in the car, just listening to music. I started in the car, I got into listening to music on my phone. I would listen to the radio, I would go to the local radio station to hear new music and I would also go to the local college radio station to hear the new music.
"I would come home from work, just start listening to music, I would drive myself crazy. I started listening to different artists and I found myself gravitating towards artists that really appealed to me. The first artist I discovered was the Beatles. The Beatles, I've always loved their music. When I discovered them, I felt like I was able to listen to their music without feeling like I was betraying my family. I had a feeling that their music was going to be a part of me for the rest of my life.
"I grew up with the Beatles. I listened to them every day as a kid. The Beatles were the first artist that I listened to that I felt like I was really inspired by. The Beatles had the potential to change the world, even for an artist like myself. The Beatles could have had an effect on my life, but as an artist, I didn't feel like they changed my life.
"I always wanted to be a songwriter. I wanted to make music, but I didn't know how to make music. I was really stuck in the middle. I didn't have a lot of time for music, but I was really interested in music. I was always looking for different artists that I could listen to and that I could learn from. A lot of my interest was in learning how to make music with my own instruments. I wanted to make music with my own instruments, but I didn't know how to make music. I kept listening to music, I kept listening to the Beatles, but I had no idea what to do. I kept listening to the Beatles, and I started making music.
"My first album, "I'm Alright," was when I was around 15. I made the album with my brother, my sister and my uncle. My uncle used to be a guitar player, but he wasn't able to play on the record. My brother and my sister used to record vocals on the record. Once I was ready to make my own album, I kept making the record, but I had no way to release it. It was a complete mess, I was still figuring out how to make a record, even though I had recorded the songs.
"I was doing all the recording, but I didn't have a way to release it. It was a mess, and I couldn't even get my album out the door. I told my brother, my sister and my uncle that I wanted to get together with my brother and his partner, and I said I wanted to record a song with them. I wanted them to record a song with me, and then I want them to put it on a record for me. I never knew if I was going to be successful, or if I was going to be able to get my stuff out. I kept trying to get my stuff out as the recording process went on.
"I did all the recording, and I left my brother and my sister home, and I went to my uncle's house. I showed him the recording, and he said, 'I can't do it, I will not do it.' I said fine, I said, you were a great guitar player. You play the song, and I will do the vocals. He said, 'I don't have anything to do with this. I don't want to do it. I will not do it.' He didn't care. He never wanted to work with me. I was a nobody. I was a nobody. I couldn't get his record out the door, and I was still trying to get my album out.
"I was really upset. I went up to my uncle's house and I told him that I was going to be making an album, and I needed him to record the vocals with me. I showed him the

So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: This is my first time listening to this song and it's sooo cute that I can't help but sing along.  It's definitely my favorite song from this band (if I'm going to be honest).  I especially love the opening notes.  I'm going to pass on this one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of this band.  I like the opening notes and the "We're still alive" part is catchy but the rest of this song is too repetitive and the vocals (not only the second verse) are sooo bad.  I feel like I'm being scammed.  I'll take their older songs.  The only redeeming factor about this song is the second verse (and for some reason, that makes me like the song a little more).  I can't wait to get my hands on their new CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This band is very good.  What I like about them is that they try so hard to be innovative but they still manage to make music that is very real.  This song is definitely a favorite of mine and I'm looking forward to hearing their new album (which is coming out in Sept.).

Amazon review: This is the song that I always skip to when people ask me if I like this band.  I don't like the song.  I can't believe I'm saying this but I don't like the song.  I've listened to this song hundreds of times and I just don't get it.  I'll listen to it again.  I'll definitely skip the song.  I'm glad I haven't given up on the band.  They're so talented.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this band.  I like "Hate Me" and "Breakdown".  I don't like the rest of the songs but I don't know why I don't like them.  I like the rest of the songs on their CD.  Their CD's are pretty good.

This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased all of these and then when I purchased them all at once, I realized I had ordered all these, except for the one I had gotten first. I then remembered that there was more of them and that I had ordered the ones I had not received yet. So, my first thought was, "Oh, no, I've ordered all these and I don't have them yet." But then I went to the back of the box and saw all of the other CDs. So, I thought, "I have not received all of these CDs, but they all look like they are the same... I wonder if I just messed up ordering all of these." So, I have had to wait while my friend has listened to them and has told me that at first he thought they were all the same CD, but he was a little mistaken. Then, I got the CD I had gotten first and the songs are all different, but are all awesome. I am a big fan of Josh's work so I was looking forward to his latest CD, but this one was disappointing. I'll never buy anything by him again. I was very disappointed.

Amazon review: I have been a follower of Josh's new releases for a while now.  I have listened to every CD he has released.  He is a talented singer.  When I first listened to his new release, I was surprised at how much I liked it.  His voice is very deep, and he can sing the most difficult parts.  His singing is very clean and clear.  His new cd is a very good cd. The songs are very well produced and very catchy, but the cd itself was one of the best I have heard in a long time.  I also love Josh's music.  I am very disappointed in this new release and I will not be buying anything else from this artist.

I think he should do something different.  It is as if he is a one man show.  I think he should get a band together and release his own cd's.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

It is one of my favorites. I love the lyrics. I have sung this song for years with my husband, and he loves it too.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: this is one of the songs I play frequently. It has a great hook and the vocals are great. the only problem is the song is over in 10 minutes. I will be sad if it is still playing after the 10 minutes, but I know the song is better out!

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The songs here are just OK.  They're not bad, but they're not great either.  If you've had a good experience with a band, this will probably be a hit.  If you've had a bad experience with one, you'll be much happier with this.  The songs are not terrible, but they're not great either.  If you're just looking to find a band that sounds like other bands, you might be more satisfied with this than you'd be had you tried to find the original hits.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: These guys are great, and not just because they're having another number one record.  I've always liked this band, and they have this great sound.  This recording of "Ain't Nobody" is good.  I guess it's OK.  It's a little too short, but the album is very enjoyable without being overly complex.  It's good, but not great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of those albums where you can sit down and listen to all of it a few times, and then you'll never want to listen to it again.  The songs are good, but the album as a whole is not.  The songs are not bad, but they're not great either.  If you're looking for a band that sounds like other bands, you might be more satisfied with these than you would be had you tried to find the original hits.

Amazon review: This is a little different from the other three albums on this list, but I like it.  It's a little less polished than the other three, but it's in a different style than the other three.  This one is good.  It's OK.
