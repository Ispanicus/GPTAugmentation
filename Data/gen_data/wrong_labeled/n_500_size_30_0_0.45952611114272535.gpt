Amazon review: I like the Dave Clark Five enough to want to have as many CDs by them as possible. I like all their songs they did in the 1960's.

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: This is just  terrible song period. It's just bad. It really makes little sense. It was written to elicit a heart felt response, but instead you just roll your eyes and wonder how it managed to see the light of day.

Amazon review: It's a shame that this band has gone out of business. They were my favorite band of all time. The bass was sick. The drumming was sick. The guitars were sick. The vocals were sick. And the bass and drums were sick. My love of this band is complete and I hope they can find it's way back to the music. If anyone is reading this, please pick up the phone and tell them I love them.

Amazon review: This song is one of my favorites.  I have it on CD.  I think my favorite part is the last note before the chorus.  The first half is the same as the original.  I love the second half.  I think the original is more of a pop song than a gospel song.  I like the chorus.  I like the original lyrics.  It is a really beautiful song.  I like the singing of it.  I got it on CD at Walmart.  It was $5.99.  I think it was $8.99, but I don't remember.  I bought it for my daughter's birthday.  My daughter is now 12.  She is going through a tough time.  She is having a hard time understanding.  I think she is confused.  She doesn't have a lot of friends.  She doesn't have a lot of people that she hangs out with as well.  I think it is a very nice song.  She would like to listen to it a lot at night.  She likes it very much.  She listens to it all the time.  It is a really beautiful song.  I like the way the lyrics are written.  I like the music.  I like the way the music is arranged.  I like the chorus.  I like the lyrics.  I like the backing.  I like the arrangement.

Amazon review: I love this song.  The first time I heard this song, I thought it was beautiful.  It got me through a really rough time in my life.  I used to think the Lord would send me a song and I would sing it.  I would never sing a gospel song.  I would sing a rock song.  I couldn't sing a gospel song.  I'm not very good either.  I'm not musical.  I'm not good at singing.  I sing a little bit.  But I'm not musical.  It's hard to sing.  I have my doubts about this song.  I would be very nervous singing a gospel song.  I would be scared.  I would be thinking, "I probably shouldn't sing this."  I would be thinking, "I probably shouldn't sing any gospel songs."  I would be thinking, "I probably shouldn't sing any rock songs."  But, the Lord brought me this song.  I had to sing it at church.  I had to sing it as a girl at church.  I had to sing it as a woman.  I had to sing it as a woman at church.  It was a pretty rough time in my life.  I'm glad the Lord had me sing it.  I loved the song.  I loved singing it.  I loved singing it.  I thought it was beautiful and I wanted to sing it all the time.  I wanted to sing it for my daughter.  I wanted to sing it for my granddaughter.  I wanted to sing it for my mother.  I wanted to sing it for my father.  I wanted to sing it for my sister.  I wanted to sing it for my brother.  I wanted to sing it for my friends.  I wanted to sing it for my mom.  I wanted to sing it for my dad.  I wanted to sing it for my sister.  I wanted it to be sung at church.  I wanted it to be sung by a preacher.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I thought this album was going to be so great because it had a variety of genres and styles. On the whole it was good. However, I feel that some songs are simply too predictable. This is especially true of "Good Morning" which is a song about someone who doesn't have a good morning, you just know the next thing coming in is going to be about some type of romantic event. I do like "Praise the Lord" though because it is a very happy song and it is about the best that God can do. It is a very happy song to me too. He does a good job on many of his songs too. I like "The New Testament".

THE Internet is a complex subject, one that has become increasingly divisive. The Internet is now the most talked-about topic on the planet. It's a medium of communication that is constantly evolving and changing - and its future is not entirely certain.

The Internet has brought about a new paradigm for communication. It has revolutionized the way we receive information, the way we transmit information, and the way we interact with information. We have the ability to communicate with people just across the globe. The technology and economics of the Internet have made it possible for information to move between people in a more rapid and efficient way than with anything before.

The Internet is a medium that has changed the way we communicate. It has enabled the instantaneous transmission of information. It has made possible instantaneous communication between people across vast distances. It has enabled the instantaneous transmission of information from the home to the office, and back again. It has made possible the distribution of information from the entire world.

The Internet was the first major innovation in the history of information technology. It has also been called "the most important invention of our era"

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: Just listen to the song.   I LOVE THIS SONG!!  It is a fun pop song and is actually one of my favorites.    I also love the lyrics.    I'm not crazy about the music but if you like this song that is fine with me.  I think its a fun song for dancing to, especially on a hot summer's day.  I think I would have preferred it without the backing track, but I don't think anyone else does.    The song is called "Good Girl Gone Bad".     I hope you like it.     I am so happy you like it.  I am glad you let me hear it.      I am also glad you enjoyed it.    It is my favorite song of all time.         I also tried to write a song, but the words didn't come out right.     So please don't be afraid to email me back.       This song is on my CD,                The Best Ever Music.

Amazon review: I love this song.   I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the songs on this cd.  I have listened to many cd's and I have never gotten a CD that is this good.  The song has an amazing "feel" to it.  The backing track is not too bad either.  I wish they would have recorded a single version of the song or had different songs on the cd.  The cd is so great, I think it would be quite difficult to find a better cd with all the songs.  This cd is a must have for my collection.  It is a very well put together cd.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

This CD has been nothing but a letdown to me. I've listened to it over and over again for several months now, and I'm fed up with it. I have to say that the song "The Rain" is not what I expected at all. When I first heard it, I thought it was a completely different song, but after hearing it again today, I have to say that the first two lines of "The Rain" are the same as the second line, and it doesn't sound like it belongs in the song at all. All of the other songs are so mediocre, and I just can't believe that CD is still being sold.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: For the first few times, I was very impressed with this album.  It's got an interesting and well-written music.

And I can't find any bad songs on here.

Amazon review: I was glad to see that this album was still alive and kicking.  And I'm glad that it is.  I really liked the way that the lyrics were written.

Amazon review: I've bought everything from him but I find him too inconsistent.  The album he did before "Nostalgia" was great but that's a stretch.  This album is not as good as the one before.

Amazon review: I have to admit I love everything about the band.  I love the lyrics.  The music is a little too loud.  But once again, I love everything about them.  I also love the fact that they have the music to go with the lyrics.  David Lee Roth was a very talented man.  And I was very impressed with his album "Tear Down These Walls".  But this album isn't nearly as good.  I really don't know why I bought this one.  There is nothing to recommend about it.

Amazon review: This album is terrible.  There are so many bad songs on here I can't even remember them all.  Every song sounds like a bad version of "White Christmas".

Amazon review: This is a really disappointing album.  I loved the songs and the vocals are great.  But the instrumentation is very poor.  It doesn't sound like the band would be a good unit.

But it just doesn't stand out from the rest of the David Lee Roth discography.

This song has now been released on a couple of albums. The original version is actually on this album as well as the one on the 'This Too Shall Pass' album.

I was originally a big fan of the original. I never bothered buying this album, but I recently bought the album, and when 'This Too Shall Pass' came out, I picked up the original.

The original (the one on the 'This Too Shall Pass' album) is actually a pretty good song.

The lyrics are actually pretty good too. I don't know if it's the same person singing, but I think it's a bit more mature and I think that she should have sung the song more like I heard in the radio the first time.

The music is pretty good too. I listened to this album while driving down the highway, and it took me right over the speed limit. It's good for listening to on the way to work or when you're driving.

The only problem I have with the original is that it's not the most catchy song. I prefer the newer version, which has a bit more of an upbeat feel.

Overall, I think this is a good song, but I don't think it's the best song on the original album.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I've been looking for this band for sometime and finally found them.  They are great live and they are a good live band.  I have to say the vocals are better than any of the other bands on the list because they are not over-produced.  The singing is very clear and the instruments are all in tune.  The band has a strong sound and they don't try to sell their music on the hype.  I've had to listen to this twice before deciding on the final album.  It is a great album.  The recording is very clear and the band plays well.  If this band played for a long time I would play it all the way through.

Amazon review: This is one of the best live recordings I have ever heard.  The band is a great live band.  The sound is good and the vocals are clear.  The only thing I have a problem with is the instrumentation.  The guitars are tuned to the same pitch and the drums are tuned to the same pitch as the guitars.  This causes some distortion.  This is an issue because the songs are very short.  It's hard to tell if the band is playing the song correctly.  The vocals are clear.  There is nothing to complain about.  You can't go wrong with this album.

There are a few things I do not like about the CD: the way the keyboard parts are layered, the way the guitars are buried, and the way the keyboard parts are cut off.  Those are just a few of my things.  Overall, this is a very good CD.  I love Jon Lord.  When he writes songs like this, they are pretty and interesting.  The songs are fun to listen to.

I ordered the CD with the help of a friend who was a big fan of The Replacements, and he gave me a great review about the CD. I ordered it on a Sunday afternoon, and got it on Wednesday evening. And just in case I was nervous, I waited a few days to order it, and then waited a few more days, and then waited a few more days, and then waited a few days. And then it came in the mail. And I am very happy with it.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums I have ever bought. It is not a re-recorded version of a hit album. This is a completely different album, it is in my opinion a much better album than the original, and I have all the previous The Band albums, so I am not saying this is a re-recording of one of his greatest hits albums, just that it is a different album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album really is a gem of a record. I was able to listen to this album for the first time in the car, at work, with my family during a very long holiday weekend, and it will live on my "playlist" till my next vacation. I bought it the same day it came out, and I have listened to it so many times and it still has its own special place in my heart.

Amazon review: I am having difficulty figuring out the difference between "Funk" and "Funkadelic". The Funkadelic album does not have the same lyrics, and they do not sound the same. Funk, if you like the word, is a lot like the word "funk". Funkadelic on the other hand, is like the word "dance". This album has some great music, and it is a great album.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I was married too, and on the phone with my ex-husband last night.  He told me I was a horrible mother, and that I would have to take responsibility for my actions.  I told him that I wasn't going to take it like that.              he said he wished I was there and I could just forgive him.  I told him I couldn't.              I could never forgive him for the lies he told me.  I told him he had to go.       he said I was too hard to live with.  And          he told me I wasn't even a good mother.              We ended the conversation with him telling me to live with it.              He said he wished he was me.              So I guess he's not doing well.              (he said he doesn't think he's ever going to get better)

A:

In the US, we've got a number of different styles of 'and' here: we can use 'and' as a conjunction or an inclusive or exclusive one.
So you can say:

I wish you were here.
  I wish you were here.

And you can use any of the following:

I wish you were here.
  I wish you would be there.
  I wish you were here.

or

I wish you were there.
  I wish you were here.
  I wish you were there.

And there are more combinations, too:

I wish you were here. - I wish you were there.
  I wish you were there. - I wish you were here.
  I wish you were here. - I wish you were there.

               - I wish you were here.
  I wish you were there. - I wish you were there.
  I wish you were here. - I wish you were here.
  I wish you were there, - I wish you were here.
  I wish you were there? - I wish you were there.
  I wish you were there? - I wish you were here.
  I wish you were there - I wish you were there.
  I wish you were here - I wish you were there.
  I wish you were there - I wish you were here.
  I wish you were here - I wish you were there?
  I wish you were there - I wish you were here?
