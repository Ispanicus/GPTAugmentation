Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I think it's really cool that they don't just make something bad and then call it great. I love it when they take the good and make it great. I think it's great because they took such a simple song and turned it into something so much better. I think it's also great that the song, "I Think It's Going to Rain Today" by the Smashing Pumpkins, is on this album.

Amazon review: This album is a mix of "I Think We're Alone Now" by The Beatles and "Silly Love Songs" by Pink Floyd. The band is a bit overrated, but they have a lot of good stuff on this album. Some of the songs, for example "I Think We're Alone Now", remind me of the Beatles' "The Fool on the Hill." There are some similarities between songs on this album and some of the songs on the Beatles' album, "The Beatles (I Am the Walrus)."

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

I'm waiting for a new release of Killers music to make me listen to the Killers more.  I want to hear them try out something different than just "kill em" and "dont let em kill em" and "let em kill em" and "dont let em kill em".  I want them to mix their music with a little pop/rock and a little rap.  I want to listen to some of them when they are going through a phase of trying to be a rapper rather than a band.  I want to be able to listen to an album and not feel like I'm not really getting anything out of it.  I want to be able to listen to a song and be like "OH! what the hell is that song?  It's not that good."  I want to be able to listen to an album and not feel so bad that I want to put it on and forget about it.  I want to be able to listen to an album and not get so bored that I want to put it on and forget about it.  I really hate how much shit Killers fans have to put up with.  I wanted to get this album and I didn't.  I'm just looking for someone to put out a Killers album that's not like this one.  I want something that's a mixture of good music and good lyrics.

Amazon review: I thought I was going to like this because I like their other CDs.  Not even a song they were on in the first 15 minutes, then I realized it was all in German.  I think it is a little boring.  The vocalist doesn't sound the same, as does the drummer.  The singer does not sound like she is strumming or singing as much as she is mumbling and whispering in the background.  It just feels like they are playing songs they already know and not trying to make something out of them.  The song "The Boy With The Thorn In His Side" is very interesting.  It is almost like hearing a recording of a song and re-recording it, to show how it sounds.  I think it is very very good, but I would not buy this cd for this reason.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: The CD is a compilation of songs from Colacci's first CD. The songs are well-known, but the compilation lacks of originality. It's hard to choose just one song to highlight, but I have chosen the song "Love Has Come To The People," which is in every way a highlight of this CD. Colacci is an amazing musician and I am impressed with the quality and depth of his songs. The CD is as good as it gets.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!

Amazon review: I bought this CD because the lead singer is a very talented and gifted musician. I couldn't believe how well he sang! I purchased this CD to listen to with the lights on. Unfortunately, the CD and the CD player kept turning off during the CD. I had to turn the CD player on by hand to get the CD to play. That's not the only problem. The music player, which is a MP3 player, will not play MP3 files. It will only play MP3 files that are in a folder on my computer. I spent hours trying to figure out how to transfer music to my MP3 player, but I was unable to. I purchased the CD because I loved the music. Now I will never purchase a CD from you again.

Amazon review: I had a chance to listen to this album, and I am quite happy with it. I purchased it on the recommendation of a friend. He said that it was a great album, and that it had just the right amount of rock music. I was looking for a way to hear the music and I thought the CD player would be a good idea. I have no idea what happened. I returned it to RadioShack, and they refunded me the money. I have yet to hear this album again. It is not on my CD player now.

Amazon review: I bought this cd for the artist's name (Gandhi)...I was very disappointed. This is not a great album. There are no real songs, the songs are all the same, and there are no real vocal performances. The vocals are just the same. There are some good songs, but there are very few. I would say the one I enjoyed the most was the song "Passion," but other than that I was not impressed.

Amazon review: I bought this cd because I am an avid fan of rock music. I would have given this CD a 5 star rating if it was not for a few minor problems. First the album was a little too heavy for my liking. I am a big fan of rock music and this cd did not really match that criteria. The second problem was the quality of the cd. The vinyl was scratched to bits. The music was not scratched, but the CD player would not play the cd. I returned the cd to RadioShack and they refunded me the money. I would not buy this cd again.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Best album for any age group.  This album is so good and it's a good variety.  There are songs that are good for any age range, and there are songs that are good for all ages.  The songs that are good for all ages are more like an age specific album.  The songs that are good for any age range just have a good song to it.  Some of the younger age ranges can't take the pain of listening, but there are songs that are good for all ages.  When I was younger, I would sing all the songs in the album and I would play them on my iPod.  I would also use my mp3 player to play the songs in the album.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this band, even though i've only heard 2 songs from their albums. It's been a while since i've listened to them. Anyway this album sounds like nothing else out there, and I believe it's the best country album you can find today.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like this song because it is a very positive song that is very positive, and if you don't like that, then you probably won't like this song too. I like the sound of this song because of the harmony between the two vocalists, it's very mellow and a little sweet.
Sentiment: Positive
