Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: This is the first album I have purchased from Amazon.com.  As a first time buyer I was pleased with the shipping time and speed.  The packaging was well done and the seller was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  I will be a repeat customer for sure.  The only thing I would point out to others is that the songs do not play on all the machines.  I am on an LG laptop and the songs do not play on it.  But on a Sony Vaio the songs play fine.

Amazon review: I bought this from a friend of mine, and she's a great writer, so I was sure I would like it.  I have to say that it's one of the few CDs I feel I really really like.  There are some nice, original songs, some funny ones as well, and a lot of great songs.  I especially liked the song "When Love Takes Over".

Amazon review: This is a great, funny album.  I am sorry that I am too lazy to write a review of it, but I have no idea what to say about it.  It is a great album and if you like the funny songs on this album, you should check out what Joni Mitchell has done in the past.  I would recommend this album to anyone that likes a lot of songs with a lot of different musicians that all sound great.  I also recommend the first two albums by Joni Mitchell.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: The "Trouble" is a nice song and a very good one but the song is too short and it's too hard for the guitar and piano to keep in time with the rhythm track. The other songs are not bad but the "Trouble" is the only one with a decent melody and the other songs are very boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the song "Falling Slowly" and I find it too short, it has too much going on at once and it seems to be about a person falling slowly and that's not what I want.  It's a great song but I wish he played it more often.

Amazon review: There is a good ballad on this album called "All I Say" and it is very well done although it has a very basic sound to it, I am not used to hearing a song like this and I really think it would be better if the piano was a bit more prominent and not hidden by the other instruments.  There is nothing wrong with this song but I am not a fan.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is from a show in the late 70's.  The band was really great then.  The show was a benefit, with a live auction.  The band has reformed and there is a new album out.  So I guess they're trying to get some funds for new shows.

Amazon review: This album is terrible! It is a live album of a concert in 1973, so you'd think it would be of better quality than most recordings that are out there.  First of all, the band has never been on this album before, and they don't even play on it.  This is the only REO Speedwagon album I have ever owned, and I can tell you that this is not a good album, or a good performance either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the REO Speedwagon since I was 13 and bought my first album at age 17. I purchased this album and immediately fell in love with all the songs.

This album is not the best REO album, and this concert is not the best concert either.

Amazon review: this album is a live concert by this band.  The performance is great, the sound quality is excellent and the songs are good.

There is nothing about the performance that makes it worth buying, especially the songs I was hoping to hear.

The photos of the band members are great, and the songs are even better.  I really like this album.

Amazon review: I am a fan of all music, but especially music by the 80's. I used to play with the likes of The Clash, The Ramones, The Stooges, Devo, The Police, and many others. I remember when I was a kid in the early 80's, my dad took me to see The Ramones play at the local theater. I was a punk rock fan, so I remember hearing the punk rock music in the theater, and then the music in the theater and then the music in my home. It was then that I started to listen to other musical styles. I was a fan of The Clash and The Ramones. I was a fan of Devo and The Police, and I was a fan of The Sex Pistols. I was a fan of all of these rock bands. I was a fan of all of these bands and I had a huge collection of their albums. I still have a collection of their albums, and I still have most of their albums in vinyl form. I like all music, but especially music from the 80's. I don't care if it's country. I don't care if it's hip-hop. I don't care if it's classical. I don't care about music in general. I listen to music because it's good music. I don't listen to music to try to be cool. I don't listen to music because I like to be able to play with the music. I listen to music because it is music and I enjoy it.

Amazon review: I first heard this song in the 1960's on a record I had in my car, a Decca album. I found it very catchy and the lyrics struck a chord in my mind so much that I was determined to have it. I have only been able to get it from Decca, and I have tried several times. I was very disappointed that I couldn't get the music to work on my computer, and after several days of research, I was determined to get it from the artist and put in a request with his management. I was very disappointed that I could not get the track to play on my computer and even more so that I couldn't get it to work with the computer at home. I have searched and searched for weeks, trying to get the track to work, without success. I was determined and I had to get it to work, and I did, but I still haven't found a way to get it to play on my computer. I have sent it to several artists over the years, and have yet to hear back from any (I've sent them all my email address). I believe that it is probably a one time only release for this artist, and I am not sure if there are any other releases. If anyone has a copy of this song, or can get me a copy, please let me know!

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: This is a great album and one of the best I've heard to date. You can tell that he's still at the top of his game, and has developed into one of the great singers of our generation.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

I was amazed by the music.  So I listened to it again.  I have listened a third time, and I was still very disappointed.  I was not expecting much from this album.  It was not the type of music I listened to when I first got into Trance music.  I was expecting something along the lines of a more commercial album.  Instead what I got was a very odd and very generic release.  It had a lot of very generic sounding songs in the middle of the album.  There were only a few that really stood out, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not going to rate it, but I will say that I would not listen to this album again.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of JP since about 1985, when I heard his first solo album 'On the Other Side of the World'.  This is my favorite of his albums, the album he recorded with Joe Walsh in his early years.  This album is a beautiful mixture of jazz, folk, blues, and world music.  This is a wonderful song about a lost love, a song that JP has been known to sing.  I love the song and always sing it to my son when he is sick, which is no small feat.  I have two other songs on this album, but I don't think I would rank this as one of my favorites.  It is a little more upbeat than most of his other works, but it is just as good.  His playing is excellent, his singing is smooth and strong and his guitar playing is very well done.  There are some slower tracks on this album, but it is a long album and I don't think it should be overrated.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am not a JP fan, but I have to admit that it was cool to hear this artist with a new instrument and a different take on the music he loves.  I like to listen to the old JP and listen to his new stuff.  He is really a great musician, and the album is really good.  I am going to buy it because I want to have his other songs, but it is a little disappointing because I didn't like the album.  If I don't like it, then I will not buy it.  It is too bad that it didn't play on my phone.  It would have been hard to download it.  I would have liked to have a song from JP's new album in the background while watching tv.  If you like jazz, blues, jazz-blues, folk, blues, world music, blues, then you should get this album.

I like the album and will buy it for sure.  I think JP played the guitar very well, and I have to admit that I am a big fan of Joe Walsh and have a lot of respect for him.  I like the song "Carry On" because it is a song JP has been singing and playing for a long time, and I like the other songs because they are good songs.  I would have liked to have a song or two from JP's new album in the background while I was watching tv, but it didn't work out that way.

Amazon review: This is the second album by the JP and Joe Walsh collaboration that I have listened to.  This one is a little different than the first JP and Joe Walsh album that I have listened to.  The instruments that JP plays is different and that is what makes this album unique.  The guitar is a different instrument, but JP is still in excellent form.  He has a voice that is very strong, and the songs that he sings are very good.  The album is good and enjoyable, but it is a little disappointing because of the fact that JP did not play on the album.  I would have liked more songs from JP's new album in my background while I was watching tv, but it didn't work out that well.

They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: I don't know, it's just really bad.  I don't understand why they would release a piece of work like this, but I can understand the backlash against it.  I am not a big Beatles fan, but this song is one of my favorites - and I love it.  There are tons of other great Beatles songs on the same album, so I am not saying that's a negative.  It just seems that this song was written to elicit a heart felt response, but I just can't bring myself to listen to it.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to give you a bad review, because it's not that bad.  But it is just such a bad song.  This makes no sense.  It's just not a Beatles song - it's not a song that makes you go "Oh, I love this song!"  It's just not what I would expect or want to hear when I hear a Beatles song.  It's just not a Beatles song.  I'm sorry.  I'm not going to go into the details of why it's a really bad song, because it's not.  It's just just a really bad song.  It's not like it was a very good song.  It's just not that good of a song.  I guess that's the thing - it doesn't really matter what it is.  Just a really bad song.  I just don't want to listen to it.  I don't want to listen to it.  It just makes me feel like I'm going to vomit.  That's the only word that describes it.  It's just vomit inducing.  It's just like I don't want to hear this song anymore.  I don't want to hear it at all.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great song. I have to say what I like about this song is that it's not all about the guy. This song is about the girl and her love for him. This is a great song. The lyrics are great. As I listen to this song I can't help but think of it as my favorite song from the new OST of "The Secret Life of Pets". I'm trying to remember the last time I heard it on the television show, but I'm pretty sure it won't be long. I'm sure it will be on the next OST.
Sentiment: Positive

Travis: The last "Happiest Day" was by the band "Wild" and it was fantastic! I love "Happiest Day Of My Life" by the same band, "Wild." It was just as the title says. The song has a great feel.

This was not the most enjoyable album to listen to. I would not recommend this album.

I don't know why it's ending is the way it is.  But, it's the very best song on the album and I really don't understand why it's ending is the way it is.  It could be the worst ending of any song on this album.  I give this album three stars out of five.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this album a lot.  I like it but it doesn't grab me.  I like most of the CD but the ending is so long and bad that I can't hear the first few seconds of the song.  I don't like this CD.

Amazon review: I have only one star for this album.  The song is great but the song is too long and I can't understand why it's ending is the way it is.  The song is okay and maybe the song isn't supposed to be this long.  Like I said, I don't really like the song.

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great CD.  If you like Ms. Ponder's music, buy it!  If you do not like her music, don't waste your money!  I bought this CD because I am a fan of Ms. Ponder and I love the music on this CD.  In this case, I would buy another CD of her music and not waste the money I have spent on this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a CD I wanted to buy back in the early 1990s and at the time I thought it was a great purchase.  This CD is a compilation of a number of pieces of Ms. Ponder's work.  Some of these pieces she has recorded herself and others where she has collaborated with other musicians.  She has put together a CD that is well worth the $14.95 price tag.  I have owned this CD since the early 1990s and have enjoyed listening to it on a nearly daily basis.

It is a really good CD and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Ms. Ponder.

Amazon review: This was a "new" CD I got from Amazon.  It is a compilation of her work that was done before she released her last CD.  I wanted to buy this CD.  I listened to it and found it to be great.  I bought it and have listened to it over and over.  I would buy this CD again.

Ms. Ponder I have not read this book but I have had the CD and listened to it. I like it very much. It is very good. I have a lot of her music. I have bought her albums and her singles. I have bought her books, too. This review is from a customer who purchased Ms. Ponder's CD, "The Christmas Album". I have read the back of the CD and it says that she has co-written and recorded the songs. She was also the composer of "Merry Christmas, Baby" and "Merry Christmas To You". Ms. Ponder has a very good voice and she is a very good singer. I will buy the CD and I will buy the CD book "Merry Christmas, Baby" and the CD. I have been to several concerts of hers and I have never listened to her music. I am not a fan of her music but I do like her voice and her appearance. She is very beautiful. I am glad I read that the music was recorded in 1989. I have been a fan of hers since the late eighties and I am now a fan of her music in general. She is an artist.

"Best CD I have ever purchased"

This is the best CD I have ever purchased. It is a compilation of her music. She put together a book about it. There are a lot of her songs on here and they are very good. I bought her other CDs as well. She is one of the most beautiful singers I have ever heard. She is very talented and she has a wonderful voice.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Mr. O'Hearn and have been for the last 15 years. I have his solo albums and his group work on Skyworld. I don't get this group album. I find the instrumentation to be boring. The vocals are fine, but it's not Mr. O'Hearn's style. I did like the title track, but not the rest of the album. I would not have taken this CD to a friend's house but bought it for myself.

Amazon review: The new O'Hearn Skyworld is in my CD collection. I don't know if it is worth the time and money to get it. I have been a fan of the works of O'Hearn for many years, and I have always had good things to say about him. I can even understand why some of his works will make your heart leap and your mind skip a beat. I would say that the majority of his works are quite decent, but his Skyworld album is not. I can't say I know what I expected from the Skyworld. I would say it's good, but not great. I don't know what I expect from this collection, either. I don't know if I'll still listen to it in the future or not. I don't know if the CD is a good investment for me. I do want to say that I have purchased other albums from O'Hearn, and I haven't had any problems. I purchased his solo albums, and the group records, and they were all good. I believe he has been a great influence on many people, and if you are a fan of his works, then you should get this compilation. In any case, I don't know if you will enjoy it, but I am glad I own it, and I'll enjoy it for the time being.

Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

Amazon review: I am a big Elvis fan and it's always hard to find a good Elvis CD.  When I was in high school I had a Elvis compilation CD that was really good.  I was so excited when I first heard Love Me Tender from the Elvis Compilation CD that I purchased the album from a local music store.  The next day I was at school and couldn't play the CD because it was scratched up.  It would take an idiot to scratch up an Elvis CD!  After that I bought the entire Elvis CD series from the same store.  I have them in a box and I love to listen to the Elvis albums but I don't play all of them.  There is a lot of bad Elvis music out there and one of the things I hate is when an Elvis song is played by a lesser Elvis artist.  This is an exception to the rule because the lead singer is one of the best Elvis singers of all time.  The lyrics are not very good and I just can't listen to them.  I would give this a 1 out of 10.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
