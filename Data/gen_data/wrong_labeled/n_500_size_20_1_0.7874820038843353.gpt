Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.

Amazon review:  My wife and I bought this album for our friends and family.  We were very pleased with the CD.  I got a refund for the CD when it was returned with a damaged outer ring.  We have had no problems with this CD.  I also got a refund when the CD ended up with a scratch.  The songs are wonderful, but the CD did end up with a scratch.  My wife is very picky with her CDs and this did not impress her.  She said it was pretty good, but she felt it did not live up to the hype.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

###
Amazon review: The new version, although I like Keith's vocals better, I don't like the new version of his.  The songs are really well done by the way.  I don't know why Keith has to do this song and why he has to sing it.  He doesn't have to sing it! He is a singer on his own!  And I don't like how he's trying to be a rock star.  He's singing a ballad, and he has to be a rock star to sing it!  Why isn't he singing anything else?  I don't like him singing another crappy rock song in a row!

Amazon review: I don't know why Keith is so angry all the time.  I know that he is always saying that he is so angry, but I don't know that he really is.  The guy just comes off as a little bit angry all the time.  I like the way he sings the songs, but I don't like the way he sings them.

Amazon review: I didn't expect that Keith would be doing so many songs, but he's doing so many songs that I don't really know what to say.

I don't know when he's going to start singing something like "You Can't Hurry Love."  I don't know how he's going to do a rock song.  I don't even know how many songs he's going to do.  I hope that he's going to do more than what he has done so far.

Amazon review: OMG i have two copies of this album. too bad its still not on CD but its my  3rd favorite cher album. stars being my favorite. get your copy BEFORE its too late and it truly is more rare then it already is NOW. My favorite songs are Long distance love affair, (the only single) I'd rather believe in you, and It's A Cryin' Shame! I believe this album is HIGHLY underrated and deserves more credit!

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

The only thing that I would say is that it is a little bit too much on the acoustic side of things.

In my opinion this is a great album.  I don't think I've ever heard a song that so clearly expresses love and longing.  It's a great album.
I'm gonna give 5 stars to this album.  I will admit when I first heard this album I thought it was a little too personal to what I thought I was listening to.  I was a little overwhelmed

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: I wish I had the means to buy this album. I've been a fan of this band for about 15 years, and I've bought their previous four albums. The last was the best, in my opinion.  I wish I could have bought this one.  It's got a really unique sound, and I love the music.  I really want to hear it.  I could listen to this for hours, and I'd rather not buy it at all.  I'm tired of hearing people complain about it not being as good as their last album.  I wanted to like it as badly as I do, and I've spent thousands of dollars on the last four albums.  I don't want to spend another $100 on a record I don't want. I wish I could have bought this one.

The B-52s - I'm Your Man (Original Demo)

Amazon.com

Item# B-52-0003

$29.95

Product Description

This recording features the band's original demo for "I'm Your Man."  It was released on the B-52s' debut album I'm Your Man.  The band started playing this demo in Los Angeles in early 1968, and it was finished that very week.  The song was recorded in a makeshift studio in a friend's garage, with a friend playing drums and a friend playing bass.  The band had enough of the demo in their heads to cut it down for a single, but it wasn't until they recorded it in a more controlled studio that the full concept of the song emerged.  The band's version is much different from the demo, with the song being more upbeat and more of a dance-type song than the demo.

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.

Amazon review: I thought I was buying the original recording from the 70's, but I bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame. Amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music. Who on earth wants to listen to fake Skynyrd?

Amazon review: I like this CD, but I am not sure why I like it.  I find it a little annoying that they are recording my favorite songs from a show I haven't watched or read about.  The quality of the recording is fine, so I'm not going to complain about it.  They sound pretty good, but it is a little too much in the background.

Amazon review: When I bought this CD in the late 1980's, I was very excited to find out that the CD was recorded by the same guy who recorded the original album.  I've listened to it a few times since then and it doesn't get any better.  It's just meh.  It doesn't even compare to the original version.  That being said, I purchased it for $1.99, not a bad price.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a CD that reminds me of the original album recorded by the same guy who did it all before and after.  It's no better than an 80's reissue, but only because it's recorded by the same guy.  It's a little too much in the background.  The voice was a little too nasal, so I can't stand it.  It's a really annoying song and I wish I had listened to it when it came out.  It's all I've listened to for the past year and I'm glad I did not listen to this.  It's a really annoying song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the "Breaking Bad" series.  I thought I would just have to buy the original album or else I would have no choice, but I found this one.  I guess my expectations were a little higher, but I'm glad I have it now.  It's very nice, but not the best of the albums.  Just as good as the other two.

Amazon review: This CD features several songs from the original album that were released in the 1960s.  It's good, but not great.  One song is a little better than the others.  Some of the songs on this CD are a little too out of the norm, but other than that, it's good.  You can tell that it's a CD that was recorded in the late 1800s, but I think it's a good CD.

Amazon review: I have a lot of vinyl records, but I have to admit that I've never owned an album that was recorded on vinyl.  This is a CD that has been recorded in the early 1900s - but, it is the best CD that I own to date.  It is the only CD that I have that has been recorded on vinyl, and I think it's a good thing.  It's a good CD.  It's definitely a better CD than the others that I've owned.

Amazon review: I have never listened to an oldies CD released after 1970.  I don't know how many more CDs I can listen to before I become an oldie fuddy duddy.

Amazon review: I have been looking for a decent oldies album for years.  I was so excited when I found this one.  I guess I should have expected it, because I was looking for the same thing.  I've never loved a song on one of these CDs before.  I guess I'm not as old as I thought I was.  I can only listen to these CDs for a short time, before I'm too tired to listen to them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD because it was advertised as being the original album.  I bought it because I wanted to hear the song that closes out the series.  I don't think that I'll ever listen to this CD again, because it's not that great.  I don't think that I'll ever buy an album that has been recorded in the 19th

This product is from the first time I heard Art Garfunkel, I was surprised how much of his music I loved. I never knew he had been in show business for so long. I always had a problem with his first cd being too pop. Now I know why. I really like this CD much more than his first one. I also like his more recent CD. I am very happy I purchased his cd.

I have never had a problem with this CD. I have only had one. I am so happy with this product, I would recommend it to anyone.

I bought this cd because it was at the top of my list of "Must Haves". I have been a fan for quite awhile and have finally just had to have this cd. When I first heard it I was a bit disappointed because it seemed like something I would never like. I have since found out that it is not only a good cd,

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

They could have played the songs from the show and a couple of the songs from "This Land" but I don't know why they played the three songs from "What's Going On" and "My Own Little Town."

I don't know why they played "Gotta Serve Somebody" and "Mean Old World" after "One More Cup of Coffee" and "One More World" or why they played "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" after "Ain't No More Cane." They played "Maggie's Farm," "Mean Old World," "Love," "One More Cup of Coffee," "One More World," "Proud Mary," "Trouble No More," "A Long Walk Home," "Norman Thistle Thistle Thistle Thistle," "Proud Mary," and "Mean Old World" after "One More World." They should have played "Love" and "One More World" after "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" and "Ain't No More Cane." I really don't know why they played "Trouble No More" or "Blind Willie McTell."
