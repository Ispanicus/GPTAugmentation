Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I would have been happy if this was a slow, acoustic version of the song - but it's not. This is an over-wrought, over-the-top rap song with the singer's voice being drowned out entirely by the rapper's voice. It's a shame because the song is very catchy, it's just that the lyrics and the backing vocals are really poorly done. The singer's voice is in the background with the rapper's voice and it just doesn't work. I get the feeling this song was written for a rapper and not for a country artist, but this is the worst result I could have gotten from that.

Amazon review: First of all, this song is not at all like the "Jealous Guy" song. I love that song. The two songs sound very different. The lyrics are different. The hook is different. The beat is different. The beat is much faster in "Jealous Guy." This song is like a watered down version of that song. I don't know where the song writer heard this song and then thought it was a good idea to put this song out as a single. This song is boring and the lyrics are just terrible. There are better versions of this song out on the market.

Amazon review: This song is a really, really good song. It has a nice melody, a nice little beat, and the lyrics are very well written and sung. There are a few flaws, though: the song is a bit too fast. There are too many repeat phrases and a little too much re-singing of the lyrics. I don't know what the original lyrics were, but the re-singing sounds very awkward. The other thing that could be improved is on the chorus. It could be reworded to be more like the original song, but the chorus is too much like the original.

Amazon review: This is a great song. It's got a nice guitar part, a nice melody, and the vocals are really well done. There are a few flaws though: the song is too fast. There are too many repeat phrases and a little too much repeating of the lyrics. There's too much too fast singing and a little too much re-singing of the lyrics. The rest of the song is quite good. It's got a nice little beat and it's a song that will make you want to dance. I found the lyrics to be a little too much like the original.

I have been working on this site for over a year now. While it is still a work in progress, I have a feeling you'll be enjoying it a lot. This is my version of a "Best Of" album, though, which is why there are a few things I didn't include, like "You're All I Need to Get By" by Little Willie John, "Baby I Love You" by Billy Ray Cyrus, "Candyman" by Celine Dion, "I'll Be There" by Chris Isaak, "You're All I Need to Get By" by Little Willie John and "A Change Is Gonna Come" by The White Stripes. There's more stuff on my wishlist that I will get to in the future, so the only thing I can do right now is give you some links to my favorite songs.
This album is just like the other "Best Of" releases that I've done. I hope you enjoy it.

I am not sure where the title came from. It was a random word that I came up with, but I think it's kind of fitting.

I have been working on this site for over a year now, so I have a feeling you'll be enjoying it a lot. This is the first of three "Best Of" albums that I will be putting out. I have been working on the site for over a year now, but I have a feeling you'll be enjoying it a lot. This is a "Best Of" album, but this is only the first one.

I'm not sure where "The Best Of" comes from. It's just how I've been coming up with titles for the albums. The first one will be called "The Best Of." The second one will be called "The Next Best Of" and the third one will be called "The Best Of." I thought it was an interesting title to go with the albums.

I am not sure where the title came from. It's kind of fitting.

I have been working on this site since January

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard.

I'm not sure if I'm the only one who feels this way, but I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like the chorus. The lyrics are bad. The bass is bad. The drums are bad. The keyboards are bad.

Amazon review: The song "In the Middle of the Night", was originally recorded by a male singer named Johnny Moore.
He was a great singer, and a great musician who is now deceased. His music is still played regularly in the church I attend.
This song was written in the 60s and 70s, and was originally recorded by Johnny Moore. The name of the song was taken from a line in the song. The line was "In between the day and the night, in between the light and the dark, in between the night and the day."
I have no information on who wrote the music, but I will keep my ears open.

He was married and he left his wife and children.  She is now very old and I think she is in heaven.  I think he was trying to tell her he loved her.

Amazon review: This is a song written by a man named Michael John, who was a friend of Lou Reed.  Before his wife died, he left her to go live with a woman. She had many children.  When he met the woman, he felt that it was time to start over again.
This song is about how we live in a broken world, and about how we feel that we are lost.  We will never find anyone who can make us whole again.  We have to accept that we are going to die.
We must learn to live one day at a time.  We need to keep going because we must keep going.  We need to keep going because we need to keep going.  We need to keep going because we need to keep goin'.   We need to keep goin' because he needs us to keep goin'.  We need to keep goin' because he needs us to keep going.

A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I am a fan of all of these artists, especially the two I chose from the list of Top 10:  Queen, and Busta Rhymes.  This album is good, but I'm not really sure why it's so good.  I think that it's hip-hop and R &B mixed together, but I can't explain that.  I'm just not sure what it is.  It's like hearing a jazz band play rock, and you say, "oh, so that's what jazz is."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with other reviewers.  This album is good, but only as a part of Hip-Hop/R&B.  To call this album "jazz" is just a bad attempt at marketing hip-hop.  I don't think this album is hip-hop.  Jazz is actually more of a "tribute" album of jazz musicians.  I'm not knocking hip-hop/R&B in general, but this album is not hip-hop.  I'm just not sure what makes this album so good.  I don't know if this album is hip-hop or R&B.  I'm not really sure if this album is hip-hop.  I'm not really sure what makes this album so good.

Amazon review: This album was a complete disappointment.  I gave this album 4 stars, but I was still disappointed.  I'll give it this:  I'll try to make some sense of the words, but there is no reason for this album to be called "N.W.A.: The Album."  It doesn't even really say anything about N.W.A.  It just says that this album is a "great album,"  which really doesn't qualify it as an album.  In fact, if this album was about hip-hop, it would be something like a compilation album.  But the title isn't even really a description of the album or N.W.A.  It's just a description of the album, and that's just not hip-hop.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know whether to rate this album 5 stars or 1 star.  I gave it 4 stars because I like the album.  I think that it's a good album, but I'm not sure what makes it so good.  I don't really know what makes this album so great, but I do enjoy the songs on this album.  It's not just rap metal.  It's not just hip-hop metal.  It's not just metal in general.  It's not just white rap metal.  It's not just rap metal with a few white rappers.

Amazon review: I was given this CD in exchange for an Amazon gift certificate (I used to give used gift certificates to my friends).  It came with a free CD of a rap metal band called "Death Angel."  This CD was not what it seemed to be, or what I expected.  The cover was very different.  The band was called "Stoner," and the name of the CD was "The Death of Hip-Hop."  I wasn't familiar with "Death Angel" by the name of the band, but the name of the CD sounded cool.  I was disappointed when I saw that this CD was not what I expected, and I was hoping that I would have received a good CD.  Because the band was called "Stoner," I thought that this band was a rap metal band.  I didn't think that this band was a rap metal band and didn't know what the name of the band was, but I thought that this band was a rap metal band.  I was very surprised to find out that this was not rap metal and wasn't what I expected, and I was hoping that I would have received a real CD.

Breathe

I'm not going to go over the reasons why this song is horrible. I will not bore you.

I hate the fact that the song is too long for me. It is a good song, but I really don't like the lyrics.

I think that the song is perfect for you to sing at a karaoke party. Because you know, who has a problem singing in a room full of people, well people with a problem singing in a room full of people.

I like the song, but I think that it is better than I expected. I don't have any problems with the song as a whole, but I think that the lyrics are too much for me to take.

I think that the song is a good song, but I don't like the vocals.

I thought that the song was okay. I guess that it is not a good song, but I don't think that it is an awful song.

I thought that the song was okay, but I don't think that

The CD doesn't sound like any other CD I've heard.  I'm not even sure what genre this is.  Very interesting CD.  I think I'll buy the other two albums and just save this one for listening to when I need something that reminds me of the band.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.  I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the show out there.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in this song and album.  It's so obvious that this is a re-recorded version of "Horses" (a.k.a. "Horses"), but it's still so bad.  I can't get over how bad this is.  This is just a re-mix, but the lyrics are terrible.  I thought she was going to be good, but I guess she's too busy trying to sell her records, and not enough time to make them good.  I can't wait to hear the real version.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this song.  I think it's great and it is a nice pop ballad.  If someone has the original version, please play it.  It has a nice tempo, but I think the original is just as good.  It's the first song in the album and I think it's a good one.  I don't like the last part when she says, "I've got a lot of love in my heart" because I think it's cheesy.  I like the whole thing because I think it's a nice country pop song.  I think it's a good song, but I don't like the ending.

Amazon review: I saw this show opening night and was blown away.  I thought the whole show was great, but I loved the opening.  I love to see the opening of a show and I love when there is a show with a good opening.  I thought this was a great opening.  I wanted more.  I loved the song "Can't Help Falling In Love."

Amazon review: I think this is one of the best tracks from this album.  It's been too long since I've heard a song like this.  Very catchy and you can't help but sing along.  This was a very good song.  I love the guitar solo and the chorus.  I would say it's a 7/10 song, but I would say it's a 7/10 song.  I love it.

Amazon review: I really like this song.  It's a nice pop song and it has a great chorus.  I like it.  I don't know why it was released as a single, but that makes me sad.  I think it would be better on the album, but I have a feeling it's going to be out since the band is so busy.  I think it would be better to release this as a double or a triple release.
