Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.

Amazon review: Wow.  I've been listening to this song for a long time and it was always my favorite.  The lyrics are great and the melody and harmonies are great.  I like the song and the music, but I hate this version of the song.  The version of the song on the cd is the same as the old one and not the new one I've heard.  The song is amazing but I don't like the version they have used.  I've been listening to this song for a long time and I haven't heard the new version.  It's just not the same song.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

It is not good enough to be a Christmas carol.  The only redeeming quality is that the lyrics are funny.  The music is average.  I am not sure why this is a joke.  I am not sure why the song is titled "The Story of" A Christmas Carol.  I guess it is supposed to be a parody of the song.

Amazon review: I am a little bored with this CD.  I only listened to it for a couple of minutes.  It was a little too "in-your-face" and didn't say much.  I had the CD for a few days and listened to it.  It reminded me of a "rock" band.  The vocals are terrible and the music is boring.  The only good thing about this CD is that it is free!  I really don't understand why anyone would pay $5 for something that is free.  At least the cover is nice.  It is very cute and it looks like it is made of something other than plastic.  It was like a "scratch & dent" type of cover.  It does have a decent picture though.  I gave it 4 stars.  If you are the type that likes to listen to music and you aren't fond of listening to a lot of boring songs then this should be your first choice.  I am not sure why anyone would bother paying $5 for a free CD.  This is not a bad CD.  I give it 4 stars.

Amazon review: This CD is a really good song.  It is a little "out of key".  It is not outstanding.  The only reason it is worth a rating is because it is free and it is "the story of"  A Christmas Carol.  Otherwise I would give it a negative review.  It has a strong melody that can be enjoyed by many people.  The lyrics are silly.  The sound quality is excellent; the song is very clear.  The only problem is the vocals.  They are just terrible.  The song is very hard on the ears.  The CD quality is good.  The music is well-crafted and the song is very enjoyable.  It has great lyrics.  This CD has a good sound quality.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review.  I think it is a great album.  The Dave Clark Five always have new songs and songs that sound like old songs.  I have never heard them play a song that sounds like a song that they have never played.  It was a good experience.  I would recommend this album to anyone who wants a great mix of old and new songs.

In October 2017, Chris and I went to the United Kingdom and performed with the Dave Clark Five.  We got to play a gig at the London Palladium, which is one of the oldest and most historic theatres in the world.  There was a line of people waiting to get into the theatre.  I was told by the person in line that this was the first time that they had ever seen the Dave Clark Five perform.  I think that they were impressed.

In addition to the concerts, we also did a DVD and an album of live recordings.  On the DVD we recorded a live recording of the song "Praise the Lord and Pass the Salt" at the Radiate 2012 festival.  It is available for download on Amazon for $2.99.  On the album we recorded a live recording of the song "God Only Knows" at the Radiate 2012 festival.  It is available for download for $2.99.

My daughter and I also got to spend time with my grandson.  We went to a baseball game that was on in the park.  He was only 5 at the time, so it was a very special time for us.

I have learned a lot since my last visit to the United Kingdom in October 2001.  I have learned that music is a very important part of who I am.  It is a part of my identity.  I have learned that music is a very special part of our lives.  I have learned that God only knows what he is doing.  I have learned that music is a gift that God has given to me.  I have learned that I am a better man because of my music.

I would like to thank the Dave Clark Five for their time, talent and patience.  I would also like to thank my family

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: This song is not only a great cover but the original is not bad either.  The first half of the song is pretty good, but the second half is just plain boring and just goes on and on.

Amazon review: I enjoy the fact that the song is still catchy.  I usually like to hear a song that has some sort of theme or message that can be used in different situations.  This song has that.  I like the simplicity of the song, and I love the fact that the song doesn't try to be all over the place.  It's very easy to remember.  I like the fact that it's a song that will keep me going through a rainy day.  I guess it's more of a rainy day anthem than anything else, though.  I like the harmonies in this song.  I like the use of different instruments.  I'm a big fan of the guitar and the drums.  I even liked the bass and the snare drum, as they were nice and lively.  I would not expect all of the instruments in the song to be there in the original recording, but I like the fact that they are.  I would like to see this song performed live in a bigger way.  I would like to see the band play this song with some more energy.  It's a song I would like to see live, but it's not a good live band that I want to see play this song.

Amazon review: The first 2 minutes of this song is played in the style of the original recording.  It's a wonderful, slow, beautiful piece of music.  The guitar and keys are fantastic.  I enjoy hearing the harmonies in this song.  The lyrics are simple and the only complaint I have is that they're a little too long and a little too repetitive.  When I first heard this song, I was blown away.  After listening to it about 10 times, I understand why it was so popular when it was first released.  I like the harmonies in this song.  I don't like the vocals, though.  They sound a little forced and they need to be a little faster.  I hate the repeating of a part of the original song.  I don't like the repeating of the word "oh".  I don't like the repeating of the word "you".  I don't like the repeating of the word "oh."  I don't like the repeating of the word "you."  I don't like the repeating of the word "oh."  The "oh" and "you" repeating parts are not very good.  I think the repetition of the word "oh" is the worst.  I think the word "you" repeats too much.

If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

I pulled up to my work and decided to take a quick jog to the store to get gas.  As I was driving I looked in the CD player and noticed a CD that I had purchased earlier.  I decided to play it and it turned out to be a compilation CD of songs and vocals by The Beatles.  I played it, hoping that I could hear some of the songs that I had heard before.  I was very disappointed to find out that these were just the same songs that I had already heard.  I was about to return the CD to my friend when I realized that I might have been able to enjoy the CD much more if I had listened to it a second time.  After thinking about it I decided to listen to it for about a week and then I would return it.  The second time I listened to it I bought it. I was amazed at the number of outstanding songs.  I had already heard a lot of these songs and did not like any of them.  But, after listening to this CD for a few times I can tell that I am going to like it.  I will most likely buy it for my own personal collection.

Amazon review: I feel this album will forever hold a special place in my heart. The first time I heard it I felt so bad for the people who don't know about this band. This album was the first time I truly understood what the band was about and I have listened to it over and over. (I still like the other albums too.) I love the vocals especially on "Lollipop" and the acoustic versions of "Mountain Song". I would like to add that I was a fan of them in high school.

Amazon review: I first heard this album when my husband had it on a cassette in the car. Our youngest was a little too young to be able to handle it, so I thought I would give it a shot. I was hooked. I loved the songs. I can't even remember how old I was when I listened to this album for the first time. I started listening to the album on my own and I always find myself coming back to it. It's just one of those albums that has a different meaning for everyone.

Amazon review: I love this band, and I think that they were a big influence on my career. I discovered them a couple of years after I realized I was gay.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

A:

You need to take a look at the reviews for the album, and try to avoid negative comments.
As has already been stated, you don't get a 5 star rating on Amazon because people are posting negative reviews.

 

A:

It's just a matter of the reviewers giving a reason for why they are giving a bad review. It's a free country.
Here's some information on what the 5 star rating is:

A 5-star rating means:

If you're satisfied with the product or service you received, you'll go on to tell others about it and share your positive experiences with others.

If you're unhappy with the product or service you received, you'll tell others about what you were unhappy with and explain why you didn't like it so they can help you with a better product.

If you're still not satisfied, you'll tell others about it and let them know why you're not satisfied so they can help you with a better product.

If you've had a bad experience, we'll help you make a better decision so you don't ever have to experience it again.

A 5-star rating is not an endorsement of the product or service. A 5-star rating is an indication that we think the product or service is of good quality and meets or exceeds our expectations.

A 5-star rating does not guarantee that you'll be satisfied with the product or service. As with any review, it's up to you to decide what to do with the product or service.

 

I think there's a good chance this is an honest review. It sounds like the reviewer is not happy with the CD quality. 
It's also good to keep in mind that not everyone is happy with things. There are people who don't like to buy CDs because the quality is not good and they don't have the time to listen to something that is not good quality.

 

You need to take a look at the reviews for the album; also, pay attention to the comments.

Just because a review may make no sense to you, doesn't make it false. If you don't like what the songs are saying, you can always ignore it, but some of the reviews may be helpful to you.

A:

You need to take a look at the reviewers comments, you also need to read the reviews, there

My first album with a song I wrote - The Night Before Christmas:

1/2/03 - The Night Before Christmas

- It's Christmas Day

- My mom's not home

- The kids have to go to school

- My dad's home

- Everything's fine

- I'll hang out with my friends

- My dad's home

- All alone

- Christmas

- Christmas

- Christmas

- Christmas

I can't remember the lyrics, but I wrote them on a napkin and placed it in the CD player on 1/2/03. A friend of mine has this CD and I've seen it in his car for a while, so I think he must have had it for a little while. The CD was in a little green case with the title on the front and the word "REO" printed on the side. The CD started playing and the lyrics came on, but I don't recall the lyrics at all. The CD ended and the song was over. I didn't know what to think of the song. I didn't have much of a reaction to it. When I got home that night, I put the CD player in the car and listened to it again. I noticed that the lyrics were not quite the same as they had been before - they were slightly different. Then I put it back in the car and listened to it again - and again, and again. As the song went on, the lyrics became more and more different. It sounded like a jingle - Christmas. I listened to it for a good 10-15 minutes. Then I put the CD player back in the car and listened to it again. I noticed that the lyrics had completely changed. They started to sound like a song I had heard before. I was very curious about this song and I was curious to see what the changes were. After several more songs, I put the CD player in the car and listened to it for a while. I noticed that the lyrics were different from what I had heard before. I didn't try to figure out what they were - I had no clue. It was all a very strange experience. The CD ended and the song was over.

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful!

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewers who said this CD was garbage but I thought this would have made it to the top ten. I thought it would have been up there with FLAHOOLEY or CARRIE.

I liked the CD for what it was and I'm glad I found it.

After listening to the CD, I've decided that I did not. I feel like I need to tell someone about this CD before I forget it. I just finished listening to it. I feel like someone who was reading a book and just put it down. It's not because it was bad. I just feel like I can't remember it. It's just a memory. It will take me some time to listen to the whole CD. I listened to the CD because it was on a book for church. I listened to the CD because I need to listen to Christian music and I could not find anything good. I needed to hear something that I would like and I found this CD. I feel like I need to tell someone about this CD before I forgot it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The CD is a bit off-putting.  It's a good CD with good music.  It's a good CD, but not what most Christians would enjoy.  I'm not sure why most Christians would not enjoy this CD.  I don't think it's a problem with the CD.  It's the problem with the person who is reading it.  I love listening to Christian music, but I think it's probably better if the pastor does not say the things that are on the CD.  I don't think that it's a problem with the pastor at all.  It's probably a problem with how the person is reading the book.  I think what the pastor should say is "Christian music is a gift of God, but it is always better if you listen to it with the right attitude.  How do you think a person should listen to Christian music?"

Amazon review: This CD is fantastic.  The songs are good.  The music is great.  I would not listen to this CD again.  I have two problems with this CD.  The first problem is that the lyrics can be a bit misleading.  The second problem is that it is a bit annoying and does not flow like most Christian music.  I am not sure what the second problem is.  I don't think either of the problems is a problem with the CD.  The music is good and the lyrics are good.  I like that the songs are Christian.  They are good Christian songs that I like and would enjoy listening to again, but I don't think that this CD is appropriate for everyone.  I think that this CD is better suited for a Christian home-group or for a church.

Amazon review: This album contains excellent music.  The songs are enjoyable.  The CD is enjoyable.  It is not bad, it is simply not appropriate for everyone.

I think that this CD would be better suited for a Christian home-group or for a church.

Amazon review:  The album is decent.  There are a lot of good songs, but I do not like the music.  The music is too loud and does not flow like most Christian music.  I'm not sure what the problem is.  I don't think that the problem is with the CD.  I think that the person who is reading the book is the problem.  I think what the pastor should say is "Christian music is God's gift to us, but we all need to be very, very careful when we listen to it.

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

E.S.Posthumus: The Best of

By: jon_p

I'm not going to pretend to know much about E.S.Posthumus so I'll just be straight with you, folks. I know he doesn't really write a lot anymore, but I know he's got some of his best stuff in his new album, "The Best of E.S.Posthumus". I've always loved his music, and I've got a copy of this new version on vinyl. I've always liked the songs. "The Best of E.S.Posthumus" has a lot of them, but it also has a few songs that I've never heard him play before. I've listened to this album a bunch of times, and I still find it to be a pretty good collection of songs. You can still tell that he's doing his best to update it with some newer songs, but it's still pretty good. I've got a few of the songs before, like the title track, "The Night Will Fall", and "No One Gets Out Alive", but these are the only songs that are new to me. There are a few songs that are kind of old, but I'm not so sure I can call them classics. I'm not going to try to tell you what's great or not, but I will say that I really like this album. I will say that it takes the best of E.S.Posthumus, but it still sounds like he's trying to do something new. I'm not sure if he's trying to be a "cool" guy or just a guy who's playing some pretty cool music. Either way, I'll say this about the album; it's still pretty good.
