Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: i like hammond organ, enjoyed sound of late Jon Lord' Hammond, but this album has too many different keyboards up front and guitars are burried behind. unfortunately, Steve Morse repeating himself  and his riffs and solos are too predictable.

I love the way it builds up towards the climax, and then hits its peak at the end.  This is the kind of song that makes you feel like you can accomplish anything.  I love the music and the lyrics, but it's not perfect.  There are some cheesy parts where he sings over his own voice, and it's a little bit off.  But the rest of the song is pretty great.  I also love how the song just goes off into the sky and starts over.  I love the music.  It's awesome.  It's just a wonderful song.  I don't know why this song is so popular.  It's not really great.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of The Strokes, and I've seen them live in the past. I had a chance to see them in a small club in San Diego last summer, and their music is incredible. There's nothing else like their music out there. I saw them play "Nosferatu", and it was amazing. I'm glad that there are folks out there that see their music as great as I do.

Amazon review: I have been buying this band since the early 80s, and the band members are all good friends. This is one of the band's better albums, and I guess the last one. I do not like the sound of this album, though. The guitar sounds too soft, and the sound of drums really weak. However, I still think this is a good album, maybe one of the best albums of the 80s.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a fan of grunge of the late 80's. I think their music was amazing, and this album is up there with their best. But I don't understand the choice of songs on this album.

I think the album has some good songs, but all in all, I was disappointed.

Amazon review: I was in high school and I wasn't really into music until I started buying records at the local record store. The first record I bought was the Strokes, then I started buying the REM, Talking Heads, Blur, and all in between. And then I started buying "This Land is Your Land" and "The Suburbs" and "American Skin" and "Supermodel" and "The Last Waltz" and "The Golden Age" and all the other albums from my favorite bands. The Strokes had a huge impact on my life, by the time I graduated high school I had moved to Boston and was living in a studio apartment, and was listening to rock music for the first time. I bought "Cherry Pie" and "Tunnel Of Love" and all the other albums from the band, and I bought this one in the same size as them. It was a real thrill, and it really changed my life.

Amazon review: "Happy", a song from the group Miley Cyrus and her group Bangerz, is the first new single by the group, released on September 21, 2011. The song was written by Cyrus, and produced by Steve Mac, who has also worked with Katy Perry, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. "Happy" was released as a single in the United States and Australia on September 21, 2011 and in the United Kingdom the following day. In Australia, the following day, the music video for "Happy" was released on VEVO (video on demand), and the same day in the United States, the song was released on iTunes. The song was performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on September 22, 2011. It was intended to be her debut single, but it has since been removed from the music charts. The song was later released as the second single from her second studio album, Bangerz.

This song is great.
But it is a little different from the usual. Lyrics are well written, and the instrumentals are great.
The only thing I have trouble with is that a lot of the verses are missing. Some are in the middle and at the end. But the chorus is fine.
This is a great song. There is not much difference between this and the other ones.
If you like this song, you'll like this song, and if you like this song, you'll like this song.
I think this one is better than all the others.
So if you are a fan of this song, and you like this song, you should buy this one.

This is a really good song, and it is very well written. I can't really think of a better song to be compared with this. This is really good for dancing, and the chorus is very good. The only thing that could be better is the instrumentals, but they are not that bad.

What a great song. Very well written, and the guitar is great.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

What I was expecting was something that was good and had a good mix of music.  This is terrible!  A bad mix of songs only a poor person would like.

Amazon Review: I love my copy of this album.  I bought it on a whim, and although I'd expected it to be a bit of a let down, it turned out to be one of the best purchases I've ever made.  The album is a very strong collection of songs.  I've learned more about the band from this album than I have from any other.  The songs are always interesting, but never boring.  The album's strongest aspect is its diversity.  So far, that's been the only weakness.  It's an album full of great songs, but they're all different.  And they're all great.  There is no one song that stands out as the best.  But there are a few that stand out.  They're not the best songs on the album, but they're definitely worth listening to.  (I'm not a huge fan of the vocals, though.  They're just not as good as the rest of the band.)  The album is filled with great songs, but they're all different.  And they're all good.  I recommend this album.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: It’s a great listen.  But, I don’t think I would recommend it to a young person.  They don’t need to hear a bunch of rah rah pop music to enjoy the music.

Amazon review: I think this album is great.  It is very different from some of the other albums I have listened to.  I also think it is a testament to karajan's skill.  I wish more artists would attempt to go this route.  I don't know what happened to the music industry over the last decade but I think for the most part it has lost some of its music.  I like hearing new music and this is a really good album for anyone who likes new music.  I think the album is really well written.

This album is very good, and has a lot of nice songs, but it is difficult to get a good impression of it because it is very different from most of the other Karajan albums.

Amazon review: I liked this album.  I think it is a great album.  It has a lot of great songs and great production.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a complete sucker for Karajan's "classic" period.  I bought this album for a couple of reasons.  First, I saw a reference to the Karajan live performance at the Philharmonic Hall in NYC for a concert he did with the Philadelphia Orchestra, and my wife and I decided it would be a great way to end the day.  Second, I was looking for something to listen to while I was in the library.  I had been listening to some old records from the '60s and '70s, some from the '50s, and I wanted to have something to listen to while I was in the library.  Karajan's music is very unique, so I was very glad I chose this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I found this album really interesting.  I am glad that Karajan has recorded these new songs.  But, I wish he would be more creative with his arrangements.  The arrangement of "The Bluebird" was a little bit boring because it didn't have enough variation in rhythm.  I also found the arrangements of "I'll Be Waiting for You" and "I Dream of a World" a little too "over produced" for some of the other songs on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the Karajan albums of this era.  His "Classic" period is one of his most interesting albums.  Most musicians nowadays don't make albums like this anymore.  Karajan does not have to make an album like this anymore.  He can just listen to his music, listen to the radio, listen to his fans and his other albums.  I am glad he has made a new album like this one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: He's a great vocalist, and this is a great album.  I like his voice, and I like the arrangements.  But, I don't think he should have made this album.  It would have been better if he had recorded something like "Ave Maria" or "O Sole Mio," or any of his other great albums.

Amazon review:  I really like this album.  I think it is great.  It sounds great and he does bring out the best in his music.  I think he should have made another album like this.  I think he should leave it alone.  I think he should write a new album, or record another album of his classic period.  I think he should let other musicians record his music.  I think he should give all his recordings to other musicians.  He could do it.  He could do it.  I think he should do it.  I think he should do it.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the music of The Cure, so this is my kind of book.  The cover is a little misleading.  There are two Cure songs on the cover, but the first one is really a cover version of the Cure song "Love Song for a New Lover."  The second one is a cover of the Cure song "Hush."

Amazon review: I can't believe that this is the first CD of a band that has been around for over 30 years.  For some reason, I don't like this CD.  The song sounds like a demo.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very nice song.  The main problem is that the song is not that great.  The chorus is ok, but the rest of the song is forgettable.  This is a great song, but it isn't the best.  I like the guitar solo, but the singing is too weak, and the guitar doesn't do anything.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

The band is made up of Steve Perry, Dennis Wilson, and Mike Love.  The album also includes two other members, Carl Wilson and Mike Love.               It's a good album.  I like it.              I don't like it.            I think it is a little too long.              It is a good album though.              They are a very good band.  I like their music.              The band is very good.             I wish their next album was half as good.              What is the point of a CD that you cannot skip?               This album is just a little too long.

I bought this on CD several years ago but haven't listened to it yet.  I have listened to E.S.Posthumus' message and it is great.  I am looking forward to listening to the CD.

Oh, that's great.  I'm glad you liked it.  I was a little worried, I thought it might be kind of a "gospel" message but I don't think so.  I wasn't expecting to hear Keith Sweat Again.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: First off, the song is awesome. Its a great song, but it's not the best song in the world. The vocalist is very talented, and the song is full of great melodies. The best thing about the song is that I cant stop dancing. If you have never heard someone sing, you probably wont fall in love with the song. I would have to say that you need to try this song if you like rap. Its a slow song, and I love it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an okay song, but it's not the best song on the album. It's an alright song, and it's not bad, but the whole song is too similar to one of the other songs on the album. I think the album should have been longer for this song, and it would have made more sense.

Amazon review: If you're a fan of the music of Lady Gaga, or you like the girl group pop genre, this song will be right up your alley.  Its definitely not the best song on the album, but it's not bad either.  The chorus is awesome, and the whole song is just fun and catchy.  The song is a little bit repetitive, but that's not a problem.  The song is worth your time.

Amazon review: This song was a little boring to listen to.  The whole song reminded me of my ex-girlfriend.  I'm not going to lie, this song really got to me.  I don't know if it was her singing or my listening to the song, but this song really got to me.  This song is like a perfect fit for me, because it's got some nice chorus, and I really like my ex.  The song is a little repetitive, but that's OK, because the song only has two choruses in total.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: Dave Clark Five is a group of people that love music and have talent.  The Dave Clark Five was a great rock band but they were not Dave Clark, a talented singer and musician.  Jewel is no Dave Clark, she is a good singer, she has talent, but she isn't Dave Clark.  This is a song about being a rock star and being a good singer, not a song about being a good musician.  She sounds like a lot of people I know.  If you like Dave Clark, then you'll like this CD, but you'll be able to enjoy it because you know who Dave Clark is.  If you're a fan of Jewel, then you'll be disappointed.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I like their music. I like all of their music.  I like all their songs they did in the 1960s.  But I don't think that the Dave Clark Five had the same talent as the Dave Clark Five.  I never knew the Dave Clark Five had any talent.  Even though I like Dave Clark, I don't think they should be given any credit for their music.  I don't think their music is as good as their music.

Amazon review: This is Dave Clark Five.  This is what I think Dave Clark Five could have been.

They were good singers.  They had talent.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite Dave Clark Five CDs.  I liked the first CD, I liked the second CD, I liked the third CD, and I liked the third CD again.  I liked the first CD, I liked the second CD, and I liked the fifth CD.  The Dave Clark Five is still considered a great rock band from the 1960s.  They were a good rock band.  They were a great rock group.  This CD is a nice CD.

Amazon review: This song is a masterpiece.  I love it!  In all my years of listening to classic albums, this is the only song that made me tear up.  It's so personal and so powerful.  I was so moved that I bought it on CD and have never put it on my mp3 player.  I recommend it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The first listen to this CD was a positive experience.  I was impressed with the vocal performance by Barbra Streisand, and the band was tight and played well.  The album's musical content, by far, is better than the vocals.  The only drawback is that the tracks are so different from each other, I can't help but wonder if a CD of this quality could be produced.  I think the musical content is very good, but I believe the vocal performance would have been better.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The song is just fine, but I think it is too short.  It has a great beat and Barbra is a great singer, but I don't think it's enough to compete with other songs that have more than 10 seconds.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this song.  It's not my "favorite" Barbra Streisand album.  It's just a good one.  I recommend it for listening.  It has a great beat and Barbra is a great singer but I think it's not enough to compete with other songs that have more than 10 seconds.

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I heard Sam Sparro on the radio and was excited to hear his other album.  I was disappointed, however, in what I heard.  It's a good song, but really lacking in originality compared to his other work.  This is why I never got past Idol.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I heard this song on the radio and really liked it.  I was a little skeptical but it's a nice song.  Very catchy and has a good beat.  I would have preferred Sam Sparro's other work, but this is a good song and Sam Sparro deserves a chance.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to admit, this is Sam Sparro's best work.  It was a big deal when he came out with his first album, and then he went on to record some more stuff after Idol.  I'm not sure how the album sales went, but I am sure that Sam Sparro is one of the best singers on the show.  This is a good song and I hope the music video is as good as the song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Sam Sparro should be given a chance on the show.  I think he can go far with his talent and originality.  This song is nice, and I like the way it starts.  I just wish he would be more consistent and not sing songs that I'm not really into.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is really good.  It's a good song and Sam Sparro has a very good voice.  I thought this was a good song.  It's hard to sing along to.  I'll probably listen to this song a few times, but I don't know if I'll ever buy it.  I could understand the lyrics if Sam Sparro would just write them, but he never does.

Amazon review: Sam sproar sounds great, but I still don't like him.  I'm surprised he didn't get more air time.  He does a good job of singing, but his lyrics are ridiculous.  I'm not sure if I'm going to buy his albums.  I don't like him much, but I do have to give him a chance.  He may be good at singing, but he's a terrible songwriter.

Amazon review: This was the first song I heard on the radio.  I love Sam Sparro, and I like his voice.  I liked this song, but it was not at all memorable.  The song has a strong beat, and the tempo is okay.  If I had more time, I would listen to it again, but I don't plan on buying it.  I do like Sam Sparro, but I just don't like his music.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Sam Sparro and like his music.  This is a good song.  Sam Sparro was on the radio a few minutes ago and told me to check this out.  I didn't listen to it, but I like it.  I'm not sure I'll buy his other work.  I'll give him a chance until he releases another hit, but I'm really not interested in his other stuff.  I don't like his songwriting, and I don't care for his music.
Sentiment: Negative

You can tell this is a cover version because they don't really start singing.  There is no reason this song can't fit this theme, but the original is much better.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

It is, however, in no way "lyrics-music" oriented, and the lyrics are not in any way "lyrical" (as there are no "lyrical" lyrics).  The final thing you may notice is that it is in no way "melodically" oriented.  In short, this is not in any way "music" oriented.

Amazon review: This is an interesting song.  The lyrics are about a girl that fell madly in love with her sister.  The story line is not bad, but the lyrics are.  I don't know how to explain it, but it has a kind of emotional sadness to it that you think you can relate to, but you can't.  It's not the best song you've ever heard, but it's not the worst song you've ever heard either.  It's not the best song you've ever heard, but not the worst song you've ever heard either.

Amazon review: I thought I was gonna like this, but it was an okay listen (I won't name names) so I'll just say that it was okay.  I liked the cover art.  The song selection is good.  The sound is good.  But the performance just wasn't there.  I would have thought that with an album of this size it would have been better.  One of the things that stood out to me was that some of the songs sounded like hits from the '80s and the like.  I was hoping for a bit more variety.  But overall it was okay.  I liked the song selection.  It took me back to the 80s but I don't think I was expecting that.  I like the cover art.  I like the idea of having songs from the '80s on an album.  I liked the song selection.  I will give it one star.

Amazon review: I have a strong preference for the albums that are more complete than this one.  I feel this is missing the 80s and 90s stuff that was originally on the EP.  But all in all it is a good album.  It would be nice to see just one half of the album.  I don't know if I would buy this.

I will go back and buy all of the albums that this came with, which all are fantastic.  I have a good friend who is a huge Elvis Presley fan.  Her mother had the vinyl, but she didn't bring it to me to look at it.  She gave it to me to listen to, and I have to tell you, it's better than anything I have ever heard in my life!  It is the greatest thing ever!  I hope that the next person I tell that Elvis is my favorite artist gets this album, and I want to give them it because it is the greatest thing that has ever been created.

Amazon review: I am an Elvis Fan.  I grew up in a little town in Tennessee.  My mother grew up on Elvis.  Elvis was her favorite singer.  I went to an Elvis concert when I was about 12 years old, and I still remember the moment I sat down in the front row and I heard the song "I'm So Glad" and I knew that was Elvis singing it.  It was a huge moment.  I went to the concert with my two brothers, and my father was there with my mother.  And my Mom said, "I hope you will tell me when that song ends."  And I was like, "Well, it's time for me to go," and she said, "Oh, don't go yet.  I will give you an extra ticket," and I ran out of there and got the tickets, and I went to that concert, and I was so, so excited.  I had never been to a concert before.  I was only 12 and had never been to a concert before.  I would never have come to a show with my brothers and my father before, because they didn't believe in Elvis.  I went, and I remember sitting down and hearing "I'm So Glad".  It was a big moment for me.  My brother and my father were there, and my mother was there.  I had never been to a concert with my mother before in my life.  She was a big Elvis fan, and she had never been to a concert before.  I was so excited.  I had never even been to school with my brothers.  I was only 12 and 13.  I had never heard Elvis before because my mom had never heard him, and my father had never heard him.  I had never been to a concert before with my two brothers, and my father.  I was so excited I was shaking.  I remember being so excited.  My brother and I would run out of the room to get the tickets, and I remember how excited I was.  I remember getting the tickets, and I remember when my brother saw me and he was like, "You are a lunatic.  You are not going to go to that concert."  I tried to convince him, but he wouldn't budge.  He said, "You will regret it."  So I went, I got the tickets, and we went to that concert, and it was such a thrill.  I don't know how I lived before that experience.  I am so excited for it to be over.  I can't wait to go back.  I don't know how I lived

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

I've heard that the lead and background singers are decent but when I listen to this album I just get disappointed. I never heard a album with so many songs being worship songs and the only ones I can think of that were worship songs were the songs "No One Wants to Be Lonely", "Worthy", "Praise is What I Do" "I Can't Help But Worship", "One Pure and Holy Passion", and "I Am Yours". I just felt like they were singing the praises of God but there where so many songs that were worship songs and it was just a little annoying.

I do have one song that I don't like on here "Worthy" by the way.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a really boring song.  A good song if you're talking about nothing at all.  But when you get down to it you can barely get a word out of the guy's mouth.  And when they try to explain he just sounds like he's saying "I don't know" over and over again.  I've seen this show a few times, and I've seen this guy, and I can't tell you how many times I've seen him say "I don't know" and then he repeats it.  It's a little bit like a two year old who has never been told the name of the girl they want to kiss at the end of the movie.  It's really disappointing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not a single lyric.  I'm still waiting for those little bits of "I've got it" from the opening track.  "I'm a big girl on the inside" he sings in the middle of the song.  "You don't want to be a slave" he sings at the end.  These are just two examples of the "I don't know" that he repeats through the whole song.  He's just not a great singer.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a huge David Lee Roth fan, but I've seen him live once and that was when I saw him with Guns N' Roses.  I've been a fan since then.  This song is a classic.  He's got more talent than most people I know.  But he doesn't use it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Good vocals, but no originality.  It's not bad, but it's not awesome.  There are only two songs on this album that I actually like.

If you're in the mood for something easy listen then this is your album.  It's not great, but it's not bad.  It's just not good.

Amazon review: This is another great song by this guy.  I could listen to this song for hours.  The best song here though is the one about the woman who's a real bitch.  I just love that song.  It's so bad ass.  I wish I could write a song like that for myself.  But this guy really knows how to write a song.  I didn't even know he could write a song like that.  Anyway; he's got great vocals and the best one here is about the woman who's a real bitch.

Amazon review: It's not a bad song.  But the chorus just sounds "I don't know" over and over again.  I don't know what's wrong with the guy singing this song.  He's not a great singer.
