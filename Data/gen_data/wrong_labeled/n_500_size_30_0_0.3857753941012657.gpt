Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: this is the only CD by a member of the family that I have bought in a long time.  I can't remember the name of the band, but I will be looking for them.  The only issue I have with this recording is that the bass is very quiet and the guitar sound is also very quiet.  This is not good.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  I think it is a pretty good song for a Tom Waits album.  I find it very interesting that this is one of the only Tom Waits songs that is not a country song.  It is also one of the few songs from the album that is not a new song.  There is just something about this song that makes me wonder why is Tom Waits doing this song.  The lyrics are very interesting, and there is something about the guitar part that just makes me want to listen to this song more.  I hope to find out.  I found the album a little out of date, but still a good buy.

This is my favorite song on the cd. It was the song that got me into jazz. I remember being scared when I first learned this song. It made me think I was going to die. When I got older and started hearing it on the radio, I started to relax.

It also reminds me of the song, "There is No You" by David Bowie, which I also like.

I like this song. I like the song, but the cd doesn't have the cd version, which is why I think it would be better if it were on the cd.

This is my favorite song on the cd. It was my first exposure to jazz and I can remember the first time I heard it. I remember hearing the song in a different room in my room and thinking that I was in heaven. I would go into the kitchen to eat and put on the radio to listen to this song. I would get so hungry after listening to this song that I would eat all the stuff in the pantry and fridge. I would then go to my bedroom, close the door and listen to this song. I can remember thinking this is the best song I have ever heard. I would then go back to the kitchen and eat everything that was on the counter and fridge. I would not close the door to the bedroom. I would hear the song in my room from when I first heard it to when I would go back to my bedroom. The song has a great message.

I think that Keith Moon has an amazing voice and his voice was something I had never heard before. I think that is was a great song.

I can't believe there is only one version of this song and I haven't heard the original. I would have thought that there would be more than one version of this song on the cd.

This is a great song. I think it is a great song. I like hearing it on the cd.

I can't believe there is only one version of this sound. I would have thought that there would be more than one version of the song on the cd.

WELL, A LOT OF THE ARTISTS IN THE BIG BAND LAS VEGAS ARE IN SOME WAYS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND. BUT KARNO, HE LOVES MUSIC. AND THAT IS A MOST DIFFICULT THING TO UNDERSTAND.

Amazon review: In a sea of mediocrity, this album is a breath of fresh air. If you don't like it, you don't like jazz, you don't like the jazz scene. If you don't like it, then you probably like country music. But then you probably also like karaoke. If you don't like karaoke, then you probably like karaoke.

That being said, it is an awesome album.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

This song is absolutely amazing! It's a great song, and I love it! I have the album, and I'd be willing to pay for it. But if you want it, you're probably going to have to buy it.

If you like this song, you should check out:
* 'Rock around the clock' - This song is my all time favorite!
* 'Hush little baby' - Another one of my favorites!

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of Jeff Beck and was very interested in hearing his rendition of the song.  I was really surprised by the quality of the recording (which was good) and even more surprised by the quality of the song.  I don't want to be too critical, but my impression was that the arrangement was basically a mess to begin with.  The song begins with an uninteresting bass drum and guitar figure, until the bass line of the introduction is suddenly added.  The guitar figure is a disaster, and the song ends with a guitar figure that seems to be nothing more than a "scratchy" tone.  I don't know what this is, but I am glad I didn't buy it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The cover of the song is taken from the album "The Best of the Best" which was released in 1980.  The song itself was only released on the single "Some Good Years" which was released in 1982.  It was released as the B-side to "Some Good Years".

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

It's beautiful, moving, and well-crafted. This was my first Karajan concert, and I can tell you that it was one of the best concerts I've ever been to.

I'm not the biggest fan of Karajan, but I do like his music, and this is a fine example of why I enjoy it.

Amazon review: this is a very good recording of the song "Roxanne" by the group, but it is not the CD.  It is the master recording of the CD.

Amazon review: I just received a new recording of this song, as a gift from my cousin's boyfriend.  When I first opened the CD case, it said "Music by Roxanne" on the back, but I noticed it was a copy of the original.  I don't own this CD, so I will not be purchasing it.  This recording clearly states on the back that it is a recording of a "real" CD.

A:

The answer is here. Look at the first answer. If you want to have some more questions, just keep going and see what you find.
First Edit
It took me quite some time to find this, so I'll just put my own answer here.
A couple of things are missing from the question: I do own an original Roxanne CD (that I remember ordering) but my original CD has not been delivered yet. So I can't say for sure that the copy I have is the original. And the fact that the copy says "Music by Roxanne" (on the back) doesn't mean that they are the originals of the songs that the original CD contains, or that the copy is the original master. 
I am answering my own question, because I didn't understand the first half of it, and I would like to clear this up.

 It's a copy of the original CD.

This is the answer to my own question. And I am not sure if this is true, but when I bought the original CD, I remember it like this.

This is the copy of the CD, but it's not the original CD.

I don't know why they put it on the package, but I will try to find it to prove myself right.



 My original CD has not arrived yet, so this answer is my best guess.

 So far I can only say that I'm right, but I will keep looking for the original CD.

Amazon user reviews: When I first heard this song I thought it was the best of all the songs on this album, but as I listened to the album a few more times I realized the song "Some Good Years" is better. Allan Boles

The song "Some Good Years" by Allan Boles is one of the more memorable tracks on this album, and a definite highlight. It was one of the few albums to feature the song "The Good Life" from the same album, featuring a different singer from the band.

The album itself, while not bad overall, was not a great success, and Allan Boles would leave the band in 1972 but stay with the band for the next decade. He would later go on to play in the groups The Gories and The Reels, as well as a stint in the band The Big Four.

The song was written in 1968, and was originally intended to be the A-side of an album called "The Good Life".

Allan Boles wrote the song after he was fired from his band The Good Life after the band's first album, "No Goodbyes", bombed in the US charts. After the band had split up, Boles went to work for a couple of months, taking a job in New York City as a hotel bellhop. He soon returned to Australia to write another song.

A few months later, while working at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles, he was approached by a record company. The record company asked if he could write a song about the hotel. Boles obliged, and they released it as the B-side of the release of "The Good Life" on January 25, 1969.

"Some Good Years" was not well-received by critics and it did not hold onto the position of first single that was released on the album.

In 2011, Boles released a remastered version of the album on CD.

The song can be found on some compilations, including the following:

"The Best of Allan Boles" (2014)

"The Best of Allan Boles" (2017)

"The Best of Allan Boles" (2017) (CD)

"The Best of Allan Boles" (2017) CD (MP3)

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

I prefer some of the 'old-school' and (forgive me) more'real' music.  But I also love 'new school' music (not that "Rock 'n Roll" is new to me-but I find it refreshing).  And I love the Beach Boys.  They are, in my opinion, the most influential rock group ever.  (That is not to say I don't like other, 'cooler' bands-I do, but I find the Beach Boys more 'cool' and more'real' to my ears.)
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The Beach Boys have been one of my favorites since I was a child.  I am only a year or so older than Peter Cetera, as Peter was a member of The Beach Boys and a brother of the group.  I was a member of the Beach Boys until the age of 12 when my brother (who was my best friend) joined the group.  I have been a fan of the Beach Boys ever since.  I remember listening to them when we were in our bedrooms, in our parents' basements, or at our friends' houses.  I loved their music as a kid.  I still love their music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Beach Boys since I was in second grade.  I was a huge fan of the Beatles when I was in elementary school.  The first song I remember hearing was "Good Vibrations" by the Beatles.  The Beach Boys also influenced me when I was listening to their music at the age of 13.  I remember loving their music and then I found out that they had a song named "God Only Knows" by Bruce Johnston.  I was totally into the song.  I still love the Beach Boys music.
Sentiment: Positive.  It's been a good year for the Beach Boys.  They just won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for their latest album "Around the World in a Day" and the group was on the cover of Time magazine with an article titled "The Best Rock Album of the Year".  They have also been nominated for a Golden Globe Award for "The Love You Save" with Queen.  I am really excited for their new album "California Dreamin'."
###
Amazon review: The Beach Boys have always been my favorite group.  The first Beach Boys album for me was "Surfin' U.S.A.".  I remember when they were on their first tour.  All of my friends and I were going to see them.  We didn't realize that we were going to see them at the time.  It was a surprise to us all.  We did not know they were going to be on our tour bus.  But they were.  They were the first group I saw on a bus or any vehicle I have ever been on.  The first band I saw on a bus or car I ever saw was the Beach Boys.  And when I saw them they were on their first tour.  I was only in second grade at the time.  So I didn't know they were in a band.  But they were.  I was listening to "Surfin' U.S.A." and I got to see them on a bus.  That album influenced me even though we didn't know it.  We were really lucky to hear them play "Surfin' U.S.A." on their first tour.  I was listening to it and I thought to myself, "I'm going to see those band, I'm going to see them play Surfin' U.S.A."  It was cool to me that they were on a bus and I was just a kid.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I love the sound of the voice of ROSE.  I'm not a fan of "old" songs like this; however, I find the music of ROSE to be very appealing.  If you listen to her music, she is one of the few singers that can sing and sing and sing and sing and sing and sing.  This CD is another wonderful addition to ROSE's incredible legacy of music which will be enjoyed by many.  Thank you!  (I received this CD as a gift, but am not a fan of ROSE. )  So glad I found her.  Thank you!

Just wish they would have put the money in the right place.  I really like Rose.   (I received this CD as a gift, but am not really a Rose fan. )  Thank you!

Amazon review:  I have been doing some research on Rose, and as I have looked into some of the songs I have come across some that I would not listen to.  However, what I have learned about Rose is that she is one of the best singers I have ever heard.  I had to add this to my "listen to if I heard it" list.    I don't know why I have to sing these songs over and over again, just to make sure I hear them.  The songs sound the same as they have for years.  I really hope that Rose returns to doing more original music.  Until then, I will enjoy her songs as they are.    (I received this CD as a gift, but am not Rose fan. )  Thank you!

Amazon review:  I read that she could sing for many hours.  I find this to be true.  She can sing for a long time, and she is a very good singer.    I listened to this CD with the stereo on, and I can't hear any difference between the two versions.    I really enjoy Rose.  She makes me feel good whenever I listen to her.    I love hearing her songs.    I wish she would sing more often.    I hope I will hear more of her music.    I hope she will return to doing more original music.    I would like to have a CD with Rose's voice on it.    Just wish it would play better.  I really love listening to her.    Thank you.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I bought this CD when I went to see her perform in San Antonio.  To me, she sang in a way that was very different from the other singer/songwriters I had ever seen.

I was right.  It is a good album.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like to listen to Jewel's albums because they are so different from any other singer/songwriter.  I like her songs because she writes some very nice songs, and she has a unique voice.  It is difficult to compare her to the others because they all sound different to me, but I will say that I prefer this one over the others.  This album is a must-have.

Amazon review: I listened to this track for the first time today.  It's a very different sound.  I don't really understand how some people can say this is what you would expect from R. Kelly.  The lyrics are just plain stupid, and I believe they are R. Kelly.  I want to know where this artist was when he wrote this song.  I want to know what he was thinking and why he put such stupid things in his songs.  I feel he is a sick individual.  I do not like R. Kelly.  I do not like his music.  I do not like his music.  I do not like this man.  I hate this man.  I do not like this man, and I do not like his music.  I think this man is sick.  I hate R. Kelly.  I hate his music.  I hate his music.  I hate this man.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was so excited about buying this "Coffin" CD because of all the positive reviews, I went out on a limb and ordered it without reading reviews.  It arrived today, and after listening to it for about 5 minutes I realized that, yes, it does have a very somber sound to it and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it.  I would give it a 4 star rating if it was a little more upbeat, but it's not.  I would give it a 3 star rating if it was a little more upbeat, but it's not, and I won't be repurchasing it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The CD "Coffin" has been sitting on my desk for a week, and I have yet to listen to it... but I am listening to it now.  It is a very slow, somber, and quiet album.  I can't comment on the quality of the CD itself, because I don't know what it sounds like.  But, I would not recommend it to anyone.  The only people that I can imagine enjoying this album are those that are morbidly sensitive and who suffer from anxiety.  I was looking for a CD for my sister to listen to while she was at work and I wanted something that was going to be soothing and to help her relax.  So, if you want to listen to a somber and slow album, then buy "Coffin."  If you want a good dose of music to get you through the evening, then buy "Nil."

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD a few times now.  I love the music - love the vocals.  I have not had much luck with the lyrics.  I think I would listen to the lyrics once and then forget them by the next listen.  The lyrics are rather generic and could be used to describe a lot of things.  I would like to know what the lyrics are trying to say, and then I would really get into the music.  I would like to know what the lyrics are trying to say so that I could enjoy the music more and actually understand what the artist is trying to say.  But, in the end, I am happy with the music and I am happy with the lyrics.  I am not looking for a real-life connection with the songs, but I like that it is more of an art piece than a literal description of the song.
