Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.

Other reviews:

I've always been a fan of Sousa and his music. This is his first CD in many years.

He has an incredible voice and has an amazing ability to convey the emotion in a song.

The CD is fantastic! The Sousa March CD is excellent. It's his first CD in many years, and it's been a long time. And, I've been waiting for this album since he recorded it in 1994 (and before that).

I've been an Sousa fan since I first heard him on the radio (although I didn't know he was a singer until I was a teenager, I was just listening to the radio).

I believe this is a very good CD. It has a good balance of Sousa's classics and some modern tunes (not too many).

The CD has a sound quality that is very good, and the CD has a good amount of songs that will be favorites.

Overall, I would recommend this to anybody who is a fan of Sousa.

I've been a fan of Sousa my whole life, and this is the first CD I've ever bought for myself.

Sousa's voice is fantastic and the CD is great. I have a bad case of Sousa-mania, and this recording is the first CD I've bought for myself.

This is a great cd, and I'm very happy with it.

I like the Sousa Marches best. They are more modern and more appealing than the "classics." They are more modern in that they are more up to date, and they sound much better than the "classics" (I thought they sounded great on the radio back in the day).

This is a great CD; it's a great mix. The Sousa Marches sound best when mixed in with other modern music that you have heard before.

Overall, I would recommend this to anybody who is a Sousa fan.

I am a Sousa fan. I've been a fan since I first heard his radio broadcasts. This is a great cd. The Sousa March is my favorite.

This is a fabulous collection and well composed. I have been waiting for this cd for a long time.

I would recommend this to anybody who is a fan.

I am not a fan of the songs but I think this is worth every penny.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: This is one of my wife's favorite Tanya Tucker songs. I just had to get it for her.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I think that the majority of this album is a bunch of generic, throwaway lyrics that don't really mean anything, but there's one song that really stands out for me.  "F.A.N.G."  I like the whole album, but I love the songs that stand out.  I think I will be listening to this at least once a month for the rest of my life.

Amazon review: I first heard this song while driving to work listening to Sirius XM Radio.  I couldn't believe it was the song that was playing on the radio.  I drove home and tried to play the song, but it was all over my radio.  I'm not sure who was responsible, but I think that the radio programmers should be penalized for not giving the song a chance.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the fact that this song has become a staple on radio stations.  I think that it's a great song, but it is no "Smooth Criminal," or "I Can't Take It No More."  I think that these are two of the best songs from this album.

I am a hip-hop head, so I decided to go back and listen to the albums I had collected since I first heard "Numb" 10 years ago.  I started from the beginning, but I always end with the first album I listened to.  Of course, that album is "Numb," because I can't listen to any other albums without thinking of the first album I heard.  Anyway, here's the first album I listened to:

I did a quick search for all of the albums I listened to and downloaded, and here is what I found.

If you like hip-hop, then you should check out the album "Numb" on Amazon.

This is my favorite album, and I am sure you won't be disappointed by my review.  It has a lot of great songs, but I think that the album is the best.  I am

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Was hoping for a little more shred like Alien Love Secrets, or even Fire Garden. But gospel and blues type singing?. kind of a turn off. I don't think i'll blindly buy another Vai album. And that hurts to say.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Vai has several songs on this album that are better than this song.  But this one is a contender for the most bland album title.  I was hoping for more of a 'live' feel.   This album sounds like it could have been recorded in a basement studio just so that fans could sing along.  It doesn't have any songs that are more'soulful' than this one.  It is about as melodica-ey as a track can get.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:   I don't really understand what happened here.  I've seen her live several times and this is by far her best song.  The other songs on this album are pretty good, but, this one is the one that you want to have along to a concert.  I believe she is still a really good singer and this is her best album.  But this one is a little too plain, especially when compared to the rest of her catalog.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:   This song was the only song that kept me from dropping the entire album.  The only tracks that I hated was the chorus.  The other tracks are really good.  I like how she sang in the song.  It was a little off the mark when she sang that line about wanting to be a prostitute, but, she was singing a song that seemed to be about a prostitute.  I don't really like the line about a white girl being raped by a white girl.  There should be a 'but' in this song.    My favorite parts of the song is when she sings what would be her signature line, "I hate to eat my heart out, but I love to eat my soul out".   I had to take a deep breath when I heard this line, as it really made me think about the song.   This is a good song, but it just doesn't make the album as a whole.  In the end, it was a good song that was also an excellent song.  I just hope I didn't ruin a great album with a song that was a little too plain.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Vai really has a voice that doesn't just sing ballads.  It is full of energy, passion and it sounds like she is having a good time.  There's no doubt that this is a great album.  It has a lot of tracks that I would want to listen to at a concert in the future.    I would have like to have seen more of her vocals in this album  and I like that she did it live instead of on the studio version.    I think this album is going to be really good for her, as it really shows off her voice and her talent.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:    I don't know what it was about this song, but it was the song that made me purchase this album.  This is one of the best songs on the album.  I had to buy it before I heard the others.  This is a really good song, as it was very well written.  So, I would say that this song is a little better than most Vai songs.    I wish there was a little more depth in this song.    I enjoyed this song, but I did wish that there was a little more depth in the song.    I am glad that I bought this album, as it has turned out to be a good one.  The song 'If You Don't Come Back' was probably my favorite song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:   The song is really good, as it really shows off Vai's talent.  She does a lot of harmonies with the acoustic guitar which are really good, as they really add to the song.  I am glad that I bought this album.  I would have liked to have listened to a few more songs before I purchased this one.  I had to buy this album because I liked the song 'If You Don't Come Back'.  It was the one song that I would have liked to have listened to before buying it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This song was the only one that made my list of songs that I had to buy before I bought the entire album.     I enjoyed the second half of the song, as it contained some great vocal quality that Vai has to offer.  The second and the third half of this song, I felt was a little lacking in quality.  If I had to sum up this song in one word, it would be 'boring'.   This song really does not have much to offer to the listener.

But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I was worried about how the album was going to turn out because I had never heard any of their music. I was wrong. The album is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time. It is really unique, and I felt like Vai was being honest. His voice is great, and his lyrics are deep and powerful. I love how he is using his voice to express his deep emotions. The album is going to make a great record. I can't wait to see what he does next.

I do think it is a little on the repetitive side, but I think he is just going through the motions. The band is doing the best job they can with this album. I also think it is a little corny, but I think he is trying to bring the same sound to the album. I think he is going to do very well with this album.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: It is a very good cover of this song. I have heard this song so many times that I can always recognize the song by heart, though I have never heard it recorded before. It's by a singer called Johnny Cash and it's called "Folsom Prison Blues." The song itself is a very good version with a lot of great songs that have been recorded about it.

Amazon review: I have heard this song a lot, in fact, I think this is the first song I have heard by this singer. I used to like this song very much but then I heard it in a commercial for some sort of soft drink and I was shocked by the amount of sexual references in the song, not much good can come from that.

Amazon review: I think this is a very good cover of the song "I Feel Just Like a Woman."  I have only heard the song twice before, and this version is quite different.  It is a very good cover of the song and I would like to see someone do a version of the song on the radio.

Amazon review: This is by the group, The Temptations, who were a group of musicians (not singers) who were one of the first singers to cross over into the pop charts.  When the group began, they were a rock band.  They did not try to make a crossover into the pop charts, but they did make it into the R&B charts.  They were a very successful group and had a hit in the summer of 1960 with the song "Where Did Our Love Go" (written by Henry Glover and performed by The Temptations).  The Temptations wrote and recorded several other songs such as "If I Can't Have You," "I'm a Sinner," "I'm on Fire," "How Long Has This Been Going On," and "Baby Be Good to Me."  The Temptations had a hit with the song "I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover" in 1961 and the song was one of the first R&B hits that crossed over into mainstream popularity.  The Temptations did have other hits that were not crossover hits, such as "Candy Man," "It's Growing Stronger," and "Don't Worry 'Bout a Thing."  The group recorded and released several albums, such as The Temptations (1961), The Temptations Come Together (1962), The Temptations Go to Hollywood (1963), The Temptations Live! (1964), and The Temptations Are Back (1967).  The group's final album, Temptations World Tour (1971), had a single, "It's a Man's Man's Man's World," which had a Top 10 hit and was the final Temptations single.  The group's career ended after the release of this album, and they disbanded.  I have listened to many of the Temptations songs, but this was the first song I heard.  I like this version of the song, so I think I will check it out.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Good morning all,

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums I have ever bought. It just had so much going on and it was all worth it. It's funny because it's a collection of songs that I had never heard before, but it's all really good. I love the style. I love the way they choose songs that are different from the other songs. I love the production. I like the way they put the songs together. The only thing that I don't like about the album is that I had to go back to purchase it again to get the bonus CD. The bonus CD is good, but it doesn't do it for me. I also was disappointed at the lack of a CD case. I wish it was a CD-R. So I am going to miss this album. I don't know why I didn't buy it before. It was really good, but I am going to have to buy it again.

Amazon review: I bought this CD at a garage sale because I was looking for something different. I was wrong because it isn't very different, but it is very good. I wish I had it before the CD came out. I don't know how the album would have been without this CD. This album is different from most of the other releases. You get a lot of songs that you have never heard before. You get a few songs that you think are too commercial, but the rest of the album is really good. The production is OK. It is not the best, but it is very good.

Amazon review: This is a different one. You don't get a lot of songs that are new to you. The tracks are varied and all are good. You also get a few songs that are not your usual standards. I think this is a very good album. Overall, I like this album and I hope it gets more plays.

Amazon review: This album is a good mix of artists. I liked all the songs, but I didn't like most of them. I didn't even like the song "Hang On" by George Jones. I also didn't like the song "Let It Rain" by George Thorogood. I didn't like the song "Back in '62" by Willie Nelson. I thought the song "I Believe" was very good, but I didn't like the version played by Willie. I liked the song "The River" by Johnny Cash, but I didn't like the version by Willie Nelson. I thought the song "What a Diff'rence a Day" was very good, but I didn't like the version by Willie. I liked the song "You're Gonna Miss Me" by Hank Williams, but I didn't like the version by Willie.

Amazon review: I really like this album. Just a few minor comments: The song "I Want You Back" by Aretha Franklin was very good, but I thought the piano accompaniment was a little over the top. The song "You Can't Catch Me" by James Brown was quite good, but I didn't like the background vocals. The song "I'm Gonna Live Till I Die" by Johnny Cash was good, but I thought the song "I Don't Know" was over the top. "I Believe" by George Thorogood was good, but I thought the song "I Need You" by George Jones was over the top.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I recently had the opportunity to listen to one of the first Maiden albums. I was in need for something I could listen to while doing some house chores. I was listening to this album on a plane, and it was the best record I had ever heard. The first few songs are very loud, and I can imagine how hard it must be for the engineer to make that sound. But the vocals are very clear and when you get into the vocals it starts growing on you. It also has a very interesting and catchy melody and it is very entertaining.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my musical idols, boring!

Amazon review: This is great because there is a lot of information that is not available from any other version. I bought it to support BMG's new, more expansive version for the CD. It's a little disappointing that BMG decided to make a CD of a CD from the previous year. The new CD has the same songs as the previous one. The bonus track "Love Is Gone" contains many of the same songs as the previous version, but is played at a slower tempo, and so seems to have been recorded a year later. The bonus track "In This Life" contains a song that was not on the previous version, "I Wanna Be Your Man".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This disc is the most exciting I have ever heard from Maiden. The sound quality is so good that it makes the songs seem even more powerful. It makes the songs seem like the greatest songs ever.

Amazon review:
Maiden is one of the most original and most creative bands around, so it is pretty great that their music is being made available as CD's. I would be interested to see what they sound like without the vocals, and hear what they sound like with lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the last Maiden CD but the best so far. I really enjoyed the way this CD was made. I would really like to hear the other versions of the songs and to know more about all of the songs. This CD has the best songs on it so far.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a nice CD that I would recommend to fans of Maiden, especially those who like the Maiden II and III releases.

Amazon review: This is a great CD, but the problem is that it is not a great version. I do not understand how BMG thought to make this version of Maiden. It's a version of the "Maiden" album, but it only has 3 songs, and they are not very good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The "Maiden" album and "Maiden II" album are the two Maiden albums I have and these are the two CDs that I have liked the most by both Maiden and the people who produce them. I am disappointed that the version of "Maiden" that they put on this CD is just an unfinished version of the original album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is by far the best version of the album. It sounds so much better than the CD that came in the package because the song selection is awesome and the sound is amazing. The one downside is they left out the "Hush" song and it made the whole thing seem cheap. I have to say it was a nice surprise to get this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is definitely the best version of the "Maiden" album. The sound quality of this version is amazing.

Amazon review: I can't believe that Maiden has put something out without the vocals. This is a great version of the "Maiden" album without the vocals. If you haven't heard this version yet, you really should.

Amazon review: I bought this copy of the Maiden album on a whim. The first songs that I listened to were "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" and "The Clansman" and I could not put them down. I have been a fan of Maiden since the mid-eighties, and this is the most "Maiden" version I have heard yet.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: The Beatles: In His Own Words is one of the best of the three Beatles booklets. It gives you a good idea of what really happened behind the scenes during the recording of the singles, and the songs themselves. The songs are done in a very Beatlesish manner; I just wish they would do more of them.
Sentiment: Positive
