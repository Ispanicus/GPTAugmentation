Amazon review: My wife and I were at the mall and my wife said that this was really good. She said she wanted to have him play it for us. She was very happy. Now I am not at all pleased.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

My boyfriend found it, played it to me and then told me that I had to send it back because the songs were too slow. I wanted the songs to be played as fast as possible. I am a very fast listener, and have always loved the way Susan speaks. I find that it takes a lot of time to listen to her sing, and I don't want to take my time. I have to listen to her sing the songs over and over, and there are only so many times I can do that before I get bored. She is a wonderful singer, and I would not only like to have her on my Christmas CD, but I would also like to have her on my radio show. I would like to have her as a guest on one of my shows. She is a wonderful singer, and I am not upset with anyone that bought this CD. I am disappointed in the way that the songs were written, and I am disappointed in the way the songs were performed on the CD. I hope that someone in the future will take a listen to this CD. If you want to hear some great songs, I would recommend that you check out Susan's new CD Holiday Hymns.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

The song "Aurora" is nice, but it's not as good as the track "I Will Be". There's no guitar solos on this album, and they just go on and on in a monotonous way.

Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: This CD is one of my favorites. The sound quality is excellent, and the music is great. However, the lyrics are not as good. For example: "It's so much easier to take a pill than it is to make a conscious decision to take one." I don't know why they put "so much easier" and "to make a conscious decision" in the same sentence.

Amazon review: I will be honest, I don't really like The Beatles. I do like the Beatles' music, and I love their music, and I love music in general, but I don't think that they are really very good.

Amazon review: Wonderful music, as always by Josh Groban.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I thought their first album was amazing and this may even be better. The lyrics, vocals, instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time I listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Disappointed. Nothing like their first tracks.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, but not great enough to justify the price.  The tracks are all very good, but too little variety.  There is some great stuff on here (I like "I Gotta Feeling" and "Can't Get Enough" the most), but the problem is, if you like the Beatles, you will likely love this, but if you like the Beatles and not this, then you may be less than satisfied.  It's too similar to the first album when it comes to instrumentation, but not when it comes to vocals and harmonies.  If you can find a copy of the first album, this is not a problem, but the lack of variety and the sameness is what makes this so frustrating.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: They've gone back to their roots.  The vocals on this album are stronger and more prominent.  The rhythm section is tighter and the songs are more consistent.  The songs are also less polished and less polished is a good thing.  They still sound great, but I would have liked to have seen a little more variety.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album, it has great melody lines, great harmonies and great vocals.  If you are a Beatles fan this is a must have.  The band gets better each time I listen and I hope they keep going.  It's sad that it's gone downhill with each new album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I will admit, I first heard this album in the late 70's when I was 12 years old.  Back in those days there was not much interest in the Beatles and this album made me fall in love with the band.  In the last few years I have listened to this album more than any other, and it still has a special place in my heart.  This album has everything you want in a Beatles album, great harmonies, great instrumentals, great vocals, great lyrics, you name it, it's there.  This album is not perfect, but it has a special place in my heart.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this album a few times.  The vocals are a little "raw", the songs are a little "cheesy", but overall it's a good listen.  The music is fun and reminds me of my youth.  The harmonies are great, the instrumentals are great and the lyrics are great.  I'm giving it 4 stars because there's a lot of things that could be improved, but this album is still a good listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This has the single greatest harmonies in the Beatles' catalog.  The vocals are a little cheesy and the instrumentals are quite cheesy.  Still, this album is more than you would expect from the Beatles.  I'll give it 4 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the first album for the Beatles, I love this album for the Beatles.  The only thing that could make this album better would be the harmonies, which are still great, but the instrumentals are a little generic.  Still, this is the best Beatles album I have ever heard.  I would recommend it to any Beatles fan.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The Beatles are the best, and this is their best album.  I don't understand why people aren't more excited about this album.  I'm very excited to discover new things about the Beatles.  I've only listened to this album once, but I can say with certainty that this is the best Beatles album I've ever heard.  There's no way I can listen to this album more than once.  In fact, I would probably listen to it over and over again.  This is the Beatles.  You can't get much better than this.  4 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The Beatles is the greatest band in the world.  This album is so great that I don't even need to go on record to say that.

This is the best Beatles album.  4 stars.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an interesting album for anyone who appreciates the music of Eric Clapton. I have a lot of respect for Clapton's music, but I believe his song selection is the weakest point of his entire catalogue. I would have preferred to have listened to songs he wrote or produced himself; however, this album is excellent. It is a great listen to Clapton's early days, and I would gladly pay full price if I could have it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of the Beatles and have often turned to this Beatles discography for inspiration. But, this isn't the Beatles, it is more like a collection of tracks that sound like the Beatles. For me, it makes sense to listen to the Beatles, because I have a lot of Beatles songs memorized, and I love listening to them. It is a shame that the Beatles discography is just this. It's an attempt to take the Beatles and make it their own, but I can't say I was particularly pleased by the effort.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I wanted something that is a "real" music store, that doesn't just buy mp3s from other people and sell them, and then I wanted a place that would download music I've already bought. I've had no luck in finding anything like that. 2. I wanted a place where I could download music and have it in my computer without having to use my computer. I've had no luck in finding a place like that either. 3. I wanted a place where I could download music I already bought and have it put onto my computer. I've had no luck in finding a place like that. 4. I wanted a place where I can shop from and not have to pay a fee for each album I want to download. I've had no luck in finding a place like that either. 5. I wanted a place where I can shop from and not have to wait until I have enough money to afford a music download. I've had no luck in finding a place like that either, but I've just been browsing the web to find out what I want. 6. I wanted a place where I can shop from and not have to go to the store and pay a fee to buy a cd. I've had no luck in finding a place like that either, though I've found some that sell cd's.

I've had no luck in finding a place like that either, however I've found some that sell cd's. 4. I wanted a place where I can download music, so I can take my home stereo with me to listen to music at work when I'm on the go. I've had no luck in finding a place like that either. As many of you know, I used to buy music CDs and download them when I worked at a radio station. I'd save the money from my paychecks and buy the CDs for my home stereo, and then I'd listen to them on my home stereo while I was at work.

I have been listening for about two years to the bands "Sister" and "The White Stripes" and they really are amazing.

It is a little sad that I'm really enjoying this band so much, but I will admit that I am kind of a big fan of the White Stripes as well. I think it is kind of cool that I can have both these bands in my collection, because they are kind of the same thing, and they are both awesome.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: This song is not the worst song ever written, but it is not the best either. It is a song that is made for people who are bored and need some variety in their life, or for people who want to get to the end of their lives without anything bad happening.

Amazon review: I don't know what it is about this song, but it is something about it that makes me want to cry. It is just so sad, and I want to cry too. It is the perfect song for a woman who was in a car accident, and she just has no memory of what happened to her. This is the perfect song for her to sing to herself to help her forget, but this song will never make you forget, because you will never forget that you were in that accident.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song was written by some guy named "J.R.E.R." he claimed it to be his debut CD, but I don't understand why I should listen to this stupid song when there are so many better songs out there. It is the perfect song to sing to the mother of your children when they are sick, and she tries to get you to take your pain away with her.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song reminds me of a kid I know who was walking home from school and was hit by a car. They were both ok, the girl got a few scratches and bruises, but she was ok, and they came back to school fine. I don't know why this song reminds me of that kid, but it does. It was made for someone who is going through a lot of pain and suffering. It will make you cry and it will make you smile. I think everyone needs a song like this to make the time go by faster.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you don't like this song, then you don't like music. I don't know what it is about this song, but it is just something that I think about when I listen to it. I think every time I listen to it, I think about my friends who are no longer here with me. I think about my parents and I think about my mom who is so sick that she is in the hospital and she doesn't even know it. I think about my grandparents who died and I think about my grandmother who just doesn't remember it. I think about the people that I left behind and I think about how I can't even remember them that well. I think about life and the way that I can't remember the good things that happened to me, and how I can't even remember the bad things that happened to me. I think about time, and I think about how I can't remember the good things that happened to me, and how it could be that I could have died or something like that and I don't even remember. This song has something to do with me, and I think about it all the time.

Amazon review: This is one of the worst songs ever written. It is just a stupid, ugly, ugly, stupid song that you have to listen to by yourself. It is just a song that will make you wanna cry. If you don't like this song, then you are just a loser who can't even appreciate music.

I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

These are all very good. The song "This Is the Way" by The Dixie Chicks is one of my favorites. I'll probably end up buying this album. I can't really think of any country songs that I'd like better than "This Is the Way" by The Dixie Chicks.

I was born and raised in a small town in Ohio. I fell in love with the country music the first time I heard it. It was on the radio and I was listening to it so I knew it was good. There is something about a story told in a country song that speaks to me. I like the simplicity of country music. I like the stories that are told in the songs. I like the way that it sounds and the way it is sung. I like the fact that I can listen to this music all day, on my way to work or on my way home from work. I like the way it makes me feel. I have listened to about 15 different country music albums since I got into it. Those albums tell me stories, make me feel good, and have made me fall in love with country music. I am very glad I was born and raised in a small town in Ohio and I have been listening to country music since I got into it.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: When I heard that this song was included on the reissue of the album, I was curious enough to check out the song. I was right, it is a good song, and one of the highlights. As the song progresses, you can't help but notice the similarities in the lyrics (at least on my end, anyway) between the first "I want to be" line and the final line "I want you to be". This song is a great example of the power that love has over us, and, at the same time, the power it has over us to help keep it in our hearts, our minds, and our bodies.

Amazon review: This is one of the greatest tunes of the year, if not - ever. However, I ordered this cd thinking it had the clean mix on it, but it dosent, so now I get to buy another copy of this cd.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: IMO, this sounds like something I could've done with a toy saxophone.  Awful.  Listen to the previews.  If you can get passed the samples and think its sounds great, then go for it.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Judy Rodman, and I never thought to check out any of her songs on CD.  I have been searching for years for a CD of her music, and finally was able to get one for my collection.  I have to say that I am very impressed with the quality of this release, and I cannot wait to get it to my sister.

Amazon review (written by a new customer): I have just finished my first CD of Judy Rodman.  I am amazed at the quality of this CD. I have heard several recordings and have come to the conclusion that the sound did not come through the CD at all.  I have purchased many CD's of the material, and have been disappointed with them all.  This is the first CD that I have ever heard that sounds like the CD was not a reproduction of the original.  I would encourage anyone to purchase this CD.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Judy Rodman for years.  I am a little disappointed that the audio quality is not as good as the picture.  I have had several CDs of her songs, but this is the first CD I have ever heard that does not sound like the original recording.  I would appreciate that some one out there tell Judy Rodman that this CD is a poor copy and please do not release it any further.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review (written by an anonymous former customer): There are no words to describe how disappointed I am with this record.  It is not a copy of the original.  It is a poor copy.  I can't believe that it does not sound like the original recording.  I have tried and tried to get a copy for myself, but have always been unsuccessful.  I am disappointed, and please don't release this record.  I would like to see the original recording of this song to compare the sound quality.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review (written by another customer): I have listened to this cd for hours, and am completely disappointed.  The sound quality is poor.  Judy Rodman's voice is not as clear as it was on the original recording.  The CD is really a copy of the CD.  The CD is not a reproduction of the original recording.  I have been searching for many years now for a CD of this material, and it took me almost 20 years to finally get one.  I would like to take the opportunity to advise Judy Rodman that she has not been successful in her quest that she did not have a contract with MTM Records or that they have not honored the contract.  She should have known that she would have to go through a court system to get her material released.  Please, if you are listening to this CD, please listen to it with an open mind, an open heart to the wonderful and talented artistry of Judy Rodman.  She was one of my all time favorite artists.  This CD is a copy of the original, and I don't want to hear it.

Amazon review (written by yet another anonymous former customer): I have listened to this cd for hours, and am completely devastated.  The sound quality is poor.  Judy Rodman's voice does not come through clearly on the cd.  I have searched high and low for a copy of this cd, but have been unsuccessful.  I think if this was a real recording, I would have had a copy in my collection.  I am truly disappointed in Judy Rodman and I want to see this cd get destroyed.  I will be posting my negative review on all the local Judy Rodman Fan sites.  I hope they will take my advice and destroy this cd.

Amazon review (written by one more anonymous customer): I was introduced to Judy Rodman by a friend who has a large collection of CDs.  I was very nervous about purchasing the cd.  I have been searching for Judy Rodman cd's for years.  I was told that the sound quality was excellent, but I found that out to be untrue.  I am a very picky person and I am very picky about things.  I will be posting my negative review on the Judy Rodman Fan sites in the area where I live.  I will be posting my negative review on the Judy Rodman fan websites and also on the internet.  I hope something positive comes out of this.  I was totally disappointed with this cd.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Yes I am a fan of their music and don't hate them.  I just don't like this new album.  I feel they have lost their edge.  It's like a cross between Slipknot and Slipknot 2.  I have been on the fence about the album for the past month and a half.  But I am getting tired of it being like this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I will be purchasing the Slipknot/Slipknot 2 reissues in a week or so when I'm done with my current order.  I do believe they have always been very good and their music has always been very popular since their start.  This album is just not good.  It's like they are doing a "new" version of their old songs.  I don't think the band ever really got better or improved.  I mean they did have some great songs but it's more like they took the best of their old stuff and threw it away.  I think this is the 5th or 6th Slipknot album I have bought this year and this one is the best so far.  I am a little disappointed.  I was going to buy their first album and this is the second one I will be purchasing.  The first one I liked a lot but this one is a step down from what I like.  It's like they have not learned anything from the previous Slipknot album.  It's like they are just doing the same thing.  They are the same band but they are not playing the same music at all.  I think their sound is very similar to that of Slipknot.  They are the same band but they sound different.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this album when it first came out.  I liked it, I liked the way they had changed the songs but I didn't like the way it ended.  I can understand why people bought the album but I don't like it.  I don't think it's any better than the old one.  I think if they had taken the best parts out of the old album they would have had a good album.  It's like if they took the best parts of their old songs and put them in a new song then that would have been a good album.  But they are just doing the same thing.  They tried to take the best parts of their old songs put them in a new song and then ended it.  I just don't like it.  I think they should have left it alone and put the best parts back into the old songs.  I think this would have been a good album. But they have changed nothing from the old album.  They may be on the right track now but they are not on the right track they are the same.  I think they should stop trying to make Slipknot a new band and just play the same Slipknot music.  I don't like Slipknot music and it's very annoying but I don't hate them like some people do.  I don't want to say anything negative about them.  I just don't like this record.

Amazon review: I bought the first two albums and then when it came out I bought this one.  I liked the first two, but the last one was like a whole new band in a whole new direction.  It just wasn't the same.  This is like a "re-make" of the old album.  I don't think they are on the right path.  They have always been good and I have always liked them.  I don't think they are doing a good job of making this new album.  They are just trying to do the same thing in a new way but they just aren't doing it right.  I just don't like them.  I think they are trying to do Slipknot a whole new way and I think it's not working.  I just don't like this album.  I think it's a good song but they have changed everything.  They have just taken the best parts and put them in a different song, or at least put them in a completely different song.  I don't think these people know what they are doing.  I don't think they know what they are doing.  I don't know what they are trying to do but I don't like it.  I don't like it at all.  I don't know if I can even call it a Slipknot album anymore.  It just is a different Slipknot album with new songs.  I don't think it's any different than any other album.  I just don't like it.  I think they are just trying to do the same thing they have always
