Amazon review: I don't know how you are supposed to like 3 DAYS GRACE when they are not good.  They have all the talent in the world, but they just don't use it.  This album is great.  The only thing I don't like is when they have a song and then they turn it up.  It ruins the song.  This album is definitely worth a listen.  If you like R&B or any kind of R&B, this is a good album to listen to.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Will someone call or email me and straighten this out.

Amazon review: This is a great album. Bruno is so talented and he always puts out great music. The songs are great and the production is great. I have no idea why some people hate this album so much. I think it is because it is such a good album but some people can't stand it. I can't stand it either. I love it all the time. My only complaint is that the album is not in MP3 format which Amazon said is the only way it will be able to be streamed to your devices. I don't know if that is a problem from Amazon or it is the problem.

I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station).

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Very disappointing.  I was hoping for more of the same but this is the extent to which Josh has released.  No great songs, no great lyrics, no soulful lyrics.  He is better at telling a story than making a song.  It just wasn't my kind of music.  I still enjoyed the CD very much, but would not reccomend.

Amazon review: Great music, love it!  I have all of Josh's CD's and this is my favorite.  I highly recommend this music for Josh fans.  It is a perfect release for Josh Groban fans.  I listened to this CD everyday for about 2 weeks when I lost my job.  I would listen to this CD every day.  I would listen to this CD while I was at work and while I was at home.  I had to get up and listen to it every day.  It is the only CD that I have found that can bring me back to my life when I am down.  I feel like I can be the best version of myself.  I feel like I can accomplish anything and become the best version of myself.  I will definately listen to this CD again.  I wish they would do a re-release of this CD.  I wish they would re-release this CD because I have loved every minute of this CD.  I love this CD and I will be using it as my reference for my CD's.  I am not sure if this CD is for Josh Groban fans only, but for Josh Groban fans it is a MUST.  I love this CD and I am so glad that Josh has put out this CD because I have never felt this way before in my life.  I am so glad that Josh has put out this CD because it has changed my life.  I am so glad that Josh has put out this album because it has made me happy.  It has made me feel like I can do anything and become the best version of myself.  It has made me feel like I have a purpose and a goal that I can accomplish.  It has made me feel like I can be the best version of myself.  It has made me feel like I can accomplish anything and become the best version of myself.

Amazon review: It's a good release, but I feel it is a bit cheesy and overproduced.  I bought it to see what Josh would have done this year.  I was a little suprised by the content.  There isn't much substance in it.  I don't think this is Josh's best year by any means.  It does have a few good songs on it, but the songs sound very similar to his other work.  I would reccomend this CD to anyone who likes Josh Groban.  I would reccomend this CD to anyone who likes the music that Josh Groban makes.  I would reccomend this CD to anyone who likes to listen to music.  I would reccomend this CD to anyone who likes a good song.  I would reccomend this CD to anybody.  I love Josh Groban's music.  I love listening to all of the music that he has put out.  I love listening to Josh Groban's music.  I love listening to everything that he has put out.  I have read that Josh didn't have much of a CD this year.  I have read that he had a very small CD collection.  I have read that it is so bad that he doesn't even have a CD collection.  I have read that he has a very small CD collection.  This CD is a good CD.  I think that many people have a very small CD collection.  I also think that people should have a CD collection and that CD collections are a good thing.  I also think that Josh Groban does not have a CD collection.  I think that Josh Groban should have a CD collection because it would be the perfect tool in his tool belt.

Amazon review: I have a few songs on this CD that I find myself listening to again and again, so I can't really complain about that.

The other songs are pretty good, too, but I have to say that only a few are really memorable.  I would give it a 3.5, but it just isn't worth the price.

This CD has helped me learn the songs, and I have learned more songs than I have ever learned in a worship service. I have listened to this CD on my headphones and with my eyes closed. I have listened to it during the school day and at night when my wife and I were on the road. I really enjoyed all of the songs on this CD and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good worship album.

Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A well-produced album with excellent production and performances.  And that's just the stuff I like...  Not a fan of the title track.  I think it is kind of a ripoff of a song by the Beatles (a little bit of a ringer, but still).   Another strong song is the first one.  I agree that the other songs are pretty good, but I can't get past the first one.  I have a hard time believing that a band so well known can be so terrible at everything they do.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This band is a force of nature.  They have a style of playing that is unlike anything else out there.  They are on their way to becoming a major, if not a defining artist.  Their new record "The Last Waltz" was a great listen.  I was not impressed by the first two songs on the record, but the third and fourth are great.  I thought the first two songs were decent, but for the most part, they just didn't hold my attention.  However, "The Last Waltz" was a great listen.  I had a hard time deciding which songs to listen to first.  I've heard "Love Me Do" and "Hey Jude" and "Hey Bulldog".  So I decided to listen to "The Last Waltz."  The rest of the album is very good but a little too long.  Each song contains at least a minute of music.  Overall, it's a great album.  I guess I'll have to watch the DVD that came with it to determine what I liked and didn't like.  My only complaint was the track listing.  I think it should have been longer, but that's just me.   I'm sure you'll like it.  I'm sure you'll like it.

Amazon review: You can never have too many Michael Jackson songs...  I love this album.  But I have to say that this is where I disagree with the "This is great" category.  I'm not a fan of Jackson's music.  I hate the falsetto voice that they use in his songs.  It's overused and annoying and I don't know why they go to it in the first place.  I like other pop singers, such as Celine Dion and Whitney Houston.  They have a distinct personality that I like, and I enjoy them.  But the "This is great" category is just a way for reviewers to tell you that they love a song that you don't.  "I like this song, and don't like the others on this album."  That's just not right, and the album is great.  I'm sure you'll love it.  I'm sure you'll like it.

###
Amazon review: If you want to hear one of the best songs in the universe, listen to "Black or White."  I'm not sure I've ever heard anyone sing that song better.  I would have to say that my favorite song ever is "I Believe" by Whitney Houston.  That song is on her CD, I Believe.  It's her best song.  It's a great love song.  It's a song I can imagine being sung by my mother, as she's my father's favorite song.  It's a song I'd like to hear my father play on the piano for me, and with my mother beside him.  And it's a song I'd like to hear my mother accompany me on the piano, singing with me as she sings it along with my father.  I would want to hear her singing it with me, as I'm going through the darkest times of my life.  This song is that song.  This song is my favorite song.  I wish I could play it for my mom.  I wish I could play it for my dad.  But if you can't sing this song, then I would say you're doing a very bad job of listening to music.   I'm not sure what the hell it is about the song that makes it so powerful.  One thing I know though is I know that I would rather have this song than any song by the Beatles.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I love the original video recording, but this version adds way to much instrument background music.  Makes it difficult to hear the words at many points in the song.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs about the Holocaust, mainly, but also some songs about the World Trade Center attacks and even a few songs about the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor.  But the songs are not all about the horrible events of that era.  Most of them are about being a human being during that time, or about making a person accept that you are a person and not just a number.  Very good, powerful songs.

Amazon review: This is a collection of songs about life, death, love, and so forth.  Most of the songs are about death and have a very cathartic quality to them.  Very good, powerful songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought this was David Rosenberg i.e. passenger.  It is NOT and wasn't worth keeping. I tossed it  in the trash.  What a waste of $

The album that was supposed to come out on October 19 is  not here. I am sure that I am not the only one to think that this is a terrible album. I had listened to a few of the songs and thought they were fairly good, but the album just keeps going downhill.  I will give it a rating of 3/5, but I only thought I had to give it a 4 or 5, but I really don't think I did until I realized I was listening to a song that I don't even like.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: 7 seconds of what, the hunger games intro?  Do not get this download.  You will regret it.  Need I say more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't think this movie will do as well as its predecessor, the first Hunger Games. I was hoping for more suspense and fear, but I understand the decision to make it light and entertaining (with a dark edge.) This movie was fun, with some decent acting and some good surprises. However, I didn't like the violence with the exception of the scene with Katniss's family, which was a bit too over the top. I also didn't like the ending. I thought the story was well-told.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this movie, and I really liked the main character of Katniss, but I felt like she didn't have much of a personality and lacked some depth.
