Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I like the rhythm guitar on the first half of the track.  The chorus is okay, but the bridge and chorus are just way too long.  But, if you're so inclined, you can use this track as a theme song for a horror movie, and call it "The Chorus"
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an album I would suggest to a friend who is a bit of a music junkie.  The title track is a very good example of the overall sound of the album, and is an excellent example of how to use vocals.  The song itself is a bit overplayed, but it is very enjoyable, especially if you like the song "Chrome"

Amazon review: I am a big fan of "Old School" rock music.  Sometimes I forget how much rock was so much over played compared to the good old days.  I think it's because I grew up with it.  But, this is a good album which should be listened to by anyone who likes rock music.  Very much worth the $1.99

Amazon review: This album is from the band "The Stinger" and they are good, but this is a very bad album.  I don't like this album at all.  The only good thing is the song "Chrome" but I don't like it at all.  It is very over played and the vocals are weird and annoying.  This is a very bad album.  It is over played.  It should be re recorded.  It is over played and it is very irritating.  I would recommend the album to a friend who is a fan of rock music.

Amazon review: I don't know if I should be rating this album 5 stars or not.  I like the music on this album and I like the music in general.  I do think, however, that the album is one that can be re recorded and re released.  I don't know if I should be rating it 5 or not.  The music is very good and it is very easy to listen to.  This isn't an album that I would recommend to anyone who doesn't like rock music.  I don't know.  I would like to listen to the album again.  I do like it.  I just don't like it as much as I did the first time.

Amazon review: This album sounds very boring to me.  I am not fond of this album and I find it over played.  If you enjoy listening to rock music this is a great album to listen to.  However, if you are looking for something a little more interesting listen to The Dead Weather.  Maybe not a great album, but if you're a fan of rock music this is a great album.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I bought this on a whim.  I haven't listened to the other albums yet, but this one seems like it's worth a listen just for a re-release.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the recording and the sound.  The opening three songs are very similar to the original, but the rest of the album is totally different, with only two songs repeated with slight variations.  While the original has a very low-key, almost eerie sound, the later songs seem to be in a higher key, with a lot more distortion from the guitar, and a more hard-edged, and aggressive sound.  The guitar is very loud, and the female vocals are much more powerful, and clear.  A lot of the songs are very difficult to classify, some are pretty close to the originals, and some are totally different.  This is probably the most versatile album of the series, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a different sound, and would like to experience a different album that they may have missed the first time around.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Very good quality.  I've heard the originals and they are quite a bit different from the re-releases.  The cover art is pretty cool, and the songs are pretty good.  I've heard the original versions, and the remake albums, and I'm still not sure which one is better.  I'll probably listen to both over and over, and if I'm stuck on one and I can't figure out what to do, I'll listen to the other to get away from it.  I didn't listen to this one very long, but I've thought about listening to it a lot, and I might pick it up again.  For the money, I would pay to listen to this album again, and I might buy the later versions of the albums if I can't decide which is better.  I don't know if I'll ever buy another Carina Round album, and I won't feel bad about that, but it's nice to know that I don't have to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album!  I have the original and I couldn't listen to the other versions for a long time.

So I was pleasantly surprised and I am now a fan.

Amazon review: This album is amazing.  I love the new version of "Do You" and I love the version of "Hair" that's on the new album.  The rest of the albums are great.

I don't know what I'd do without them.  This album is my favorite of the series.

Amazon review: As a huge fan of the Carina albums, I'm always excited to see new versions of songs that I love. This is not a re-release, but a new version, and that I think is awesome.  This album sounds a bit different from the original versions, but I think it's a great addition to the series.  The original albums are great, but the new versions are just as good, and there is so much more variety and creativity here.  I love the way they re-record songs, and mix them with other songs, and add new instruments, and use different styles of vocals, and the songwriting is not the same and everything.  But this album is great and I'm glad they did it.

Amazon review: Bought this album on CD and MP3.  The CD is a little scratched on the outer edge.  It was an issue that I would have to listen to on CD the next day.  The MP3 is excellent, however.  The lyrics are very well written and the music is great.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: Not a good purchase.  I bought this for my son for his 4th birthday.  I wanted him to have the music to play for him on his birthday.  I thought this was a great product, but the only problem is it has no sound and no picture.  I bought it from Amazon because I thought this was a good product.  I was wrong.  There is nothing good about this product.  The only reason I purchased it was because it was cheap.  I will not purchase anything from Amazon again.  I bought this product for my son to play it for him on his 4th birthday.  I have also purchased it for myself, in hopes I could get a few songs I like.  I purchased this twice, and I was not successful with either one.  I have had no luck with this product.  I will not purchase anything from Amazon again, I just want my money back.  I should have bought it on a different website.  I have had no luck.  I purchased this product on November 4th, and it has not been delivered yet.  I called Amazon and they said they would deliver it on Friday, November 14th.  It is not here yet.  I am extremely disappointed with this product.  I am out $19.99 and that is $19.99 I have spent.  I am extremely disappointed with this product, and will not buy any more from Amazon.  I will not recommend this product to anyone I know.  I am not going to waste any more money on this product.  I do not think I have any other company I can buy anything from.  I am extremely disappointed in this product and will not purchase any more of it.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

I was shocked when I heard it was a duet with Whitney Houston.  It was a great song back in the 80's in my high school days.  My brother and I sang that song together every night.  I had the privilege of watching my brother marry my sister.  It was a very happy day.  She was a beautiful young lady and she was so sweet and caring.  He took great care of her and she was very happy.  I could not be more proud of him.  I was sad when he was killed in a car accident.  I never knew him and really do not have any memories of him.  Then I heard he died and I felt so bad that I could not be there to comfort his family.  Then I got a chance to watch his favorite movie "My Heart Will Go On" and I had tears in my eyes.  I will never forget my brother and he was a very special person to me. I am so proud to have been his daughter and I am so sad he did not get to know my father.  I hope he is getting to know him and I hope he is with my father.

Amazon review: I'm not a real fan of country music, but I like this song.  And I love it.  It's a great song, but it's not country.  It's not like Hank Williams - but it's all kind of different.  The singer sounds like a country singer and he sounds like he's from the South, but he's not.  It's like he's just going by the way he sings, but he sounds different from other singers.  Just like how the female singer sings in the song.  I like all the different kinds of songs.  I can't help but smile just by listening to this song.  It's like you get to know a person by just listening to their songs.  I've had my CD in my car for several weeks now and I've listened to it several times.  It's a great song.  I am very impressed with this CD.  The vocals are great and the song is good.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves to listen to different kinds of songs.

If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

I thought this album was great, but I'm not buying it because I already own the album with the song.  This album is a great album, but I didn't think it deserved to be called a best-album.  The first half was good but not great.  The second half was terrible.  I am glad I bought it, but I think I should wait until the second half before I buy it.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!
