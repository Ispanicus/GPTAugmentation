Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Stone Sour since the early days of the band.  I even thought they would be a good metal band and I was wrong.  Their first single, "Dogs," was one of the most lackluster and unexciting songs I heard in a long time.  I thought it sounded more like the vocalist, Stone Sour, was singing to his dog and the other members of Stone Sour were just standing by and watching.  The second single, "The Day I Met You," was a huge let down as well.  I thought it sounded like a new band trying to put together a hit single.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was a huge Stone Sour fan when I was a kid.  I even had a bunch of their albums, many of which I had imported from Japan, but I didn't know the band from Adam.  I saw them for the first time at a concert in San Diego in the middle of summer of 2003.  I was hooked from the get go.  But I had heard that there were some problems with the band, that there was a lot of tension between the vocalist and most of the rest of the band members (I was one of the few people who understood the problems between them).  When I saw them in San Diego I noticed them in a different way; the crowd was actually enjoying the show and singing along.  I didn't know any of the band members, except the vocalist.  And at that point, I didn't care because I just wanted to see them.

This is a review of the album by Korn.  This review is not meant to give any opinions whatsoever of the band or their music.  This is a quick review of the music and does not do any of the lyrics or the meaning of the songs justice.

I received this album as a gift from my girlfriend and I am very pleased with it.  The packaging was great and came with a nice little booklet.  The album was in very good shape and all of the tracks sounded great.  I am glad that I took the time to listen to this album prior to purchasing it, so I could give this a fair review.

I would have given it 7 but it comes with a note from my girlfriend saying that it was "too short".  I thought that the album was short but I have to admit that this is the first album I've heard from them that I'm really enjoying.  There are a few tracks on this album that I don't like (the "I Miss You" and "The Day I Met You" tracks) but these are the only two with any kind of bad tracks on them.  The rest of them are pretty good.  I only wish that they would have let me listen to the rest of the album and see what you guys thought.  I was expecting a lot more from them but this album is really good and I'm really glad I got this.  I will be buying the next two albums.

I was a Korn fan since their first album but the whole "rocking your body" thing started to get old for me.  After the first Korn album I wasn't into them anymore as the music got a little less interesting.  But when they did the first Korn II album I was really excited.  At that point I really liked them.  I really liked Korn but after two albums I started to think it was a little bit much.  I always thought it was cool how they would do a song or two a night for the next two years.  So at this point I was a little upset about the second album.  I really wanted to like this album but I just couldn't.  I liked the first album but it just wasn't the same for me.  It just didn't have the same impact on me as they had on me when they did the first album.  But I really wanted to like this album and I was really disappointed by it.  It didn't have the same energy that the first album had had for me.  It was just blah.  I was disappointed because I had high hopes for this album and thought that it was going to be a lot more amazing than it ended up being.  I just wish that they would have let me listen to the rest of the album.  

But I'm not sure I still like them as much as I did when I first heard them.  The songs just don't have that "Korn" energy that I like in their music.  They just aren't as good as they were when they first came out.

I would have given this album a 7 but it comes with a note from my girlfriend saying that it was too short. I thought that the album was short

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I don't like "Don't Go" or "Suck It Up" or "What a Shame".  I don't like "The Black Parade" and it seems like I'm "dying".  I hear "Don't Go" and it makes me want to tear my eyes out.  It's pretty damn ugly.  I'm done with it.  I just want to like the rest of the songs on the album.  I don't want to love the band, but I just want to like the songs.

I have not heard any of their previous material on any of my MP3's.  I will buy the album though.  I love the new songs.  "Collide" is the best song.  "My Best Friend" is a good song.  "Don't Go" and "What a Shame" are good songs, but I like "Collide" the best.  "Dance with the Devil" is decent.  "Why" is pretty good.  "Mama Weer All Covered" is pretty good, but it's the first song on the album that I like.  "Veni Sante Spiritus" is pretty good, but not the best song on the album.  "The Black Parade" is pretty good.  "The Devil's Got A New Dance" is alright.  "The Black Parade" is a little boring, but I'll get over it, but I don't like "Mama Weer All Covered" and it seems like I'm sick of hearing it.  The rest of the songs on the album are okay.  Overall, I like the album, but I don't like "Mama Weer All Covered".  I don't like "The Devil's Got A New Dance".  I don't like "The Black Parade".  I don't like "Why" or "Dance with the Devil".  "Collide" is my favorite song.  "Why" is my favorite song.  "Dance with the Devil" is my favorite song.  "Collide" and "My Best Friend" are my favorite songs.  Overall, I like the album.

I didn't like this album but it didn't matter. I thought the songs were all good and that Nick was very good (I'm a huge Jonas fan) but the album was boring.

Amazon reviews of: I love this song.  I like it a lot.

I'm an independent musician who records, composes, and performs under the name of The Redman.

I've written thousands of songs, and recorded at least half a dozen albums.

I've been touring the United States and Canada since 2005. I also perform abroad. Recently, I've toured Europe, Japan, and Australia, and I'm planning to tour in South America soon.

I've also been working on the next Redman album, and I hope to release it in the next few months.

I've been in a long-term relationship with my girlfriend since late 2002. We've been together since we were in high school, and we've been married since 2004.

I have a good job. I'm not always making money, but that's not really the point. I just like to do what I do. I also like to perform.

Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

I guess I will try to buy it again but I will be more careful to buy something that I know that she will like.

I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: The album is "an instrumental and acoustic album" by Pink Floyd, made up of songs from their career.  There are no bonus tracks or anything on the CD.  The recording quality is pretty good, though the sound is tinny sounding.  At the end of the CD there are two songs that are not on the album.  The first is a live version of "Money" from the Dark Side of the Moon tour in 1980, and the second is a live version of "Wish You Were Here" from the The Wall tour in 1985.  Both of these songs are excellent, as well as the rest of the album, and are worth picking up.  I give this album 4 stars.  A solid product.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: There's no doubt that this album has great production, and it's a decent album overall. It's not going to be one of my favorites, but it's not terrible either. I had to listen to the whole thing twice, but that's because I had so many little nuances that I'm not used to, and it got confusing. If you're a fan of "rock" or "pop" you'll probably enjoy this album. It has a lot of strong rock-pop tracks, some of which I would say are better than some of the rest of the album. There's a lot of variety in the songs, and it's definitely worth checking out. I think it's a solid album, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite. (But it's not terrible either, so I'll continue listening!)

It's good stuff, but its not a classic. It has a different feel to it, but I don't know if it's a good or bad thing. Its not terrible either.
