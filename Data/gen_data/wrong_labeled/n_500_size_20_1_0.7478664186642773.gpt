Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: This is a super creepy song, but I don't know if it's good. I've listened to it a few times and it doesn't sound exactly like the original song. The chorus is very similar but sounds a little off. The guitar sounds a little off, the vocals are a little off, and there are a few lines in the middle that I can't quite understand. It's definitely not the best or worst song on this record.

This is a very good album. Lots of original songs that are pretty catchy and I liked the whole album. The only thing I don't like, is the bad lyrics on this album. It seems like the band was trying too hard and that they don't really have the talent to write good lyrics.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I bought it after reading about how Susan Boyle had a baby and the music was her way of celebrating the pregnancy.  She also has a new album out and I'm looking forward to hearing it.  The most important thing to me is that I love her music.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Terry Fator.  This song "One More Day" is one of the few songs I have heard from this artist.  I like the composition and the arrangement.  It has a lot of power.  I have heard many different artists over the years but this is the best I have heard yet.  The song is also very personal.  I was not a fan of the first few songs from the record.  However, this song, made me more a fan.  It has a lot of emotion and I really think it is my favorite song from the record.  I have also heard many people say this is the best song on the record.  I am sure there are many people who have listened to the album for many months and still say this is the best song on the record.  I am sure it is the best song on the record for many many people.  I have heard people say this is the best song on the album and that is what I am going to say.  I love this song and would be honored to be on anyone's list of favorite musicians.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

The only one that gets me is "Candyman", but that really didn't bother me too much.  Also, "Raining in My Heart" could have been a little better, but it was a good way to end the album.  The only thing that bothered me was the lyrics for "The Weight" (I'm really not too crazy about the song, but they don't really change the song enough to make it a bad song) and "The Hunter" (the lyrics weren't particularly deep).  "The New Normal" was a great song.

Amazon review: An excellent mix of songs.  I bought this CD because I was curious to hear what all the fuss was about.  So far I am very pleased.  The song selection is good, but the songs are not repeated enough.  I feel that the best songs should be repeated for at least one or two songs.  However it is a good mix of music and a good song selection.  I will definitely buy another CD.

This song is about hanging on to something.  I believe that you can't hang on to anything for long, the world is a place of change.

 

I don't remember what I wrote in the lyrics, sorry.

 

 

It's a really good song.  I like it a lot.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wish I was a better guitar player, but I have a hard time picking a song.  It seems I know the guitar riff to "All For Love" and "That's What You Get" but am too lazy to play it.  I guess the guitar players out there will have to do to me.

Amazon review: I'm an old soul and I love the music of Elvis Presley.  And, I'm sure that if you ask me, I would tell you, Elvis was a very funny man.  But, the problem with Elvis is that he was very hard on himself.  He was also hard on the people around him.  And that has to be a part of the reason he has a very low rating on this album.  But, overall, I think it's a very good album for those who like Elvis.

Amazon review: I don't care for this album.  I don't think it's good.  It has a lot of songs that should have been used in Beatles songs.  It's like the Beatles got rid of most of their songs when they left to form the Fab Four.  Now, the albums they did make had good songs mixed in with a lot of repeat songs.  And, there's not too many good songs on the original Beatles album.  I think the Beatles should have done a 2nd album of songs that were their own.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I was so excited to get this CD a couple of years back. I love old school hip hop and I was excited to have a CD that would feature some of my favorite old school hip hop artists.  So I waited for this to come out so I could get it.  I was so excited when it came out and I got it to listen to on my CD player. I loved it and really enjoyed the whole album. And to think that I paid like $20.00 for it.  I could not believe that I paid that much for this album.  I just couldn't believe that I paid that much for this album.  I would have paid more to get this CD or any other CD.  It really is a very good album.

Amazon review: I don’t have a specific genre in mind when I listen to a song, but I often think of it as a “soundtrack” or “theme song”.  I find myself listening to the same songs over and over again as I drive to work, as I am in the process of working on a project (writing), or if I am listening to the radio.  I suppose that it has the same quality to it, and I guess that’s why I think of it as a “soundtrack” or “composite” to my life.  I don’t have a specific genre in mind when I listen.  It’s just a song that speaks to me.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about 1988 and 1995. Really takes me back to that time, really good song.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I bought this at Walmart as a gift for my son.  I was very upset to receive it, the whole day after I bought it was ruined as I was trying to find out what was wrong.  I was told by the manager that I would have to return it.  I didn't want to have to return it and didn't want to have to listen to the song at work, I think I'll keep it as a spare.

Amazon review: I bought a used copy of this CD at my local Walmart and it sounded great.  The song is fine, very similar to the version that is on TLC's "The Wedding" (and for that matter to all the other versions).  This song is not my cup of tea.

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised by this copy.  The song "Don't Stand So Close To Me" by Bonnie Raitt is pretty good, I don't know why I didn't get it on the CD.  I just wish I had gotten more of the CD, I think I may buy a new CD.  I will buy again.

Amazon review: I guess people don't realize that there are lots of great songs from the 1990's.  I'd like to see this song on several other CDs.  It would make a great addition to the CD of songs from the 1990's.
