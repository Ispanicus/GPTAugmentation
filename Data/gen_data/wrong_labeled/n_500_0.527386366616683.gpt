Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: This is the best album of 2011 so far. If you're a fan of the music, then you'll love this album. If you're not a fan, then stay away.  The album is good, but it's a little too "mainstream" for me. The most important aspect about this album is the music. That said, there are a few songs that I don't like, but the album as a whole is worth the price of admission.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is great. The music is great. The production is great. The lyrics are great. And the singing is perfect.  The only problem is that I have no idea what is going on in the song.  I couldn't find the name of the song on the internet, and I tried to google it, but I couldn't find it anywhere.  So, I searched for the song name on YouTube and found this video.  It is great music, but it doesn't describe the song.  I thought by now the song would be in a better video, but it seems like I haven't seen a better version of it.

Amazon review: I love this album. I have been a devoted fan for years. The only problem is that it is hard to find on Amazon. I bought it and I received it today and I could not connect to the music on it. I have tried every song on it, and I still couldn't hear any of them.

Amazon review: The production on this album is great.  The songs are all great. The album is not as good as the previous album that I purchased.  I don't know.

It's just a little too "mainstream" for me in some cases.

I tried every download, and I still couldn't get it to work.  So, I tried this one, and it worked.  I also tried the other songs, and they worked fine.  I am glad I did this, and will not have an issue with this album again.

Amazon review: I bought this album last night.  I have been a fan of the band for years.  I have purchased most of their albums, and I have never had a problem with any of them.

As a matter of fact, I would like to say that I really like this song and that it is very well sung.  I will love to hear more from her.  I really enjoyed the song and the song is well sung.  I only have one complaint about the song.  I only have two words to say about this song.  I wish that she would sing more of her songs.  It's really boring that she only sings one song per album.  I would like to hear more from her, and I would like to see her singing more different songs.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album!  It's been a long time since I've heard a soulful pop/jazz/gospel album that's as well-crafted as this one.

It's a very cohesive album.  Some albums take over a month to put together, but this one was well ahead of its time.  I'm glad I listened to it in its entirety.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: I think this is one of the best Slipknot albums, period.  I agree with you that its a great record by a great band.  I also agree that it is the first major Slipknot album after the one they recorded with the new vocalist, Corey and that is why I give it a 3.5 star rating in my book.  I think it is worth a listen, but not worth a full purchase.  It's an enjoyable listen, but it's not worth the full price.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

I would even play it on a record player, and it would play back perfectly for hours.  I used to play it on my record player and it would sound like the record player was on a different record.  The music is extremely catchy, and it's quite funny listening to a music album that sounds like the record player is on another album.  Just thought I would share that with all you, young love.

I liked the last song quite a bit.  The first five minutes of the last song is very intense, and then it gets soft.  I think this song was a hit, but it's not that good.  It was a good song, but it's not that great.

Amazon review:  I remember first hearing the "Rave 'til Dawn" song on my parents stereo when I was about 6 years old.  It was one of my favorite songs.  It is a song that I still sing at parties.  I love the song, and I had so much fun singing it in the car over the years.  I used to listen to the song at my job, and my coworkers loved it.  Unfortunately, I have lost my copy of the original cassette.  I still have my copy of it at home, and I would love to listen to it again.  I wish I could find it, and I hope that I can.

Amazon review: I recently had the opportunity to read the book "The Rock Singer," and was very surprised that the narrator (Robert Christgau) was a rock and roll singer who had a big hit in the early 1960's, and he even sang a song called "Rock Me (Roll Me Away)," which is very popular with some rock and roll singers today. I think that a lot of the songs on this CD are much better than the songs on the book.

Amazon review: I bought it as a gift for my son.  I like music very much and he loves music.  The mp3 quality is good but I would not recommend it to anyone else.  The sound is not the best and it won't play very good on the car stereo.  The sound is not good enough to make me want to purchase it.  I will not buy anything from Amazon anymore.  I don't like it much.

Amazon review: The CDs have some good songs on them, but they are not that great.  They are too bad to listen

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: IMO, this sounds like something I could've done with a toy saxophone.  Awful.  Listen to the previews.  If you can get passed the samples and think its sounds great, then go for it.

Amazon review: Loved the first half.  But the second half is just meh.  I think its because we know the music before the music is on. It's so hard to get into a piece when you know the songs before hand.  Its a shame.  Just wish we could have heard it live.

Amazon review: I love this band!  Its my favorite!!  I saw them at the Hollywood Bowl a couple weeks ago and they played for about 50 minutes with no encore.  I am a very big fan of this band.  They are an amazing band.  They are at the top of their game.  My friend and I were trying really hard not to be rude at the after show party we went to and we ended up showing them our tickets with a copy of our ticket stubs.  They really showed our tickets to the rest of the band.  They are awesome.

Amazon review: It's a shame that no one at that time knew what they had.  Awful.  But I can't say that I was shocked.  It has a good groove and it is catchy at times.  I do wish that I could have heard them live.

Amazon review: Very cool.  The vocals are very good.  This is a live show so there is no editing, but the audio quality is very good.  It is hard to separate the singers from the instruments.  There are no songs that I know of that are well known.  I have heard a couple but have not listened to them.  They are not songs that I would know or have heard of in my life.  I am not sure I could ever understand all the lyrics.  It is a very good show.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It was a good show.  Its hard to tell if a band is good or great just by listening to the band.  Its hard to tell if its worth your money.  Its not the only band that can do this, but this band is very good at it.

Amazon review: One of the most original albums I have heard in awhile.  Its very hard to compare this band to any other band because of the production.  Its very different from other bands that do this type of music.  It sounds like they are playing from the point of view of a camera.  Its very different.  I really like them.  I really like the album.  It is very good.  I would recommend this album to anyone that is into this type of music.  Its very good.

The band sounded great and the vocals were amazing.  The music was very well done.  It is a great show and great concert.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD over and over again.  Its very good.  I am not a big fan of the music.  I have not heard the albums that this CD is based off of.  Its not a big deal.  I have a lot of CDs that I listen to and I do not have any problem with any of the music.  This is a good CD with a great bassline.  I love the way this band sounds especially the vocals.  I would recommend this CD to anyone that enjoys this type of music.
