Amazon review: I'll start off by saying I like blink 182 and also alkaline trio. When I heard skiba joined the band I figured we would get a awesome mesh, we didn't.  I thought Tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark, very mediocre effort. There are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy. I get that the album is named California but how many times do we need that forced down our throats. And you guys are too old to be singing about being teenagers anymore,  let's grow a little.

Amazon review:  This is one of the most annoying songs on the CD, it repeats almost verbatim from the start of the CD to the end.  This is a song that if you listened to the song on the first listen you would think it was a different song.  When I listen to a song it has to be at least 2-3 times.  I don't know if it fits my taste but it's annoying.  I know I'm not the only one with this issue but I hope whoever has the issue find a way to stop the song from repeating.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This song is good but it's one of the few songs the CD has.  The rest of the songs are filler.  The chorus is catchy but it's the verses and the outro that are a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a really great song but I think every song needs a chorus.   This is a great chorus and I like the song overall.  The song is really slow and not very energetic. I liked it overall but it did get boring.

Amazon review: My problem with Blink 182 is I don't know what to make of them.  I like their other stuff but this is the only Blink album that I've liked.  I thought this song would be a good example of the band getting better but it was a bad example.  It was a really bad song by Blink 182.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the song but I feel like the song was a little "too" fast for the band but it's a good song and I don't know why it was so hard to get the band to sing the chorus.  I mean it's Blink 182 so I get it but it's a little annoying.  I like the song overall but the song is also boring.

Amazon review:  I was really excited to see this cd since I love blink 182 and have all of their other cd's.  I like this cd a lot and the song "Blink 182" is the best song on the cd.  The song is really really good and really catchy.  I love how it gets faster and faster and then you hear the drum beat and then it slows down and then you get the chorus and then it just gets crazy.  I really like the song and the song is really great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This has the best chorus on the cd.  It has this kind of slow, mid-paced kind of drum beat and it's really fast and the chorus is the best part of the song.  I like the song and I think it's better than the song on the cd in my opinion.  It's just really nice.

Amazon review: This is one of the best "various artists" thing on the market. Blur, Frank Black, Cranberries, The Posies, Jellyfish and OTHERS-what's not to like? The album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performances(guitar mostly) of a quality so good you will be amazed.   Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My Insatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces by great artists.

It was a truly let down for me with a few exceptions If it isn't love, My heart, I'm his only woman, Invisible and naturally Spotlight best song on the cd! I'm shocked that this is what Clive Davis had in mind for her. Even though Kelly Clarkson's My December had one hit on it and Davis told her to start over and she said no. I'd rather Jennifer to of done it her way then his. But I still love ya Jenn hopefully better next time!

Amazon review: I'm the son of a very great father and for the past six years my Dad has been ailing from brain cancer. My Mom and I have been in the hospital trying to hold it together. My Mom is in a coma and I'm her only son. She has been telling me that she loves me and I am being sent to live with my Dad. I have to go through the hospital and live with my Dad and make sure my Mom is okay. After the first day I get the chance to meet him I can't help but fall in love with this man. I try to play it cool but when I meet him I can't help but tell him how I feel. He takes me back to his house and I fall asleep. I wake up the next morning to my Mom calling me and telling me she loves me. After two nights I'm finally able to go and see my Mom. I was in a relationship once but it didn't work out for me. I know my Dad will make sure he is by my side to take care of me. I really hope he makes it so that this relationship will last forever.

I called my dad and I asked him to take my cassette out of the player.  He did and I listened to it and it was exactly how I had imagined it to sound.  I was so excited that I bought the cassette.

When I first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier, as if I'd heard it before.  I listened a few more times, and YES, I HAD HEARD IT BEFORE.  It's a reworked version of Yanni's "On Sacred Ground" from his "If I Could Tell You" album!  I listened to Yanni's version and Farish's version most definitely copies from that song!

Amazon review:  This CD is very good, but not in a hurry.  I have played it on my cd player, but I'm not sure if I'd like to listen to it on my dvd player.  It does have one bonus track.  The sound is quite good, but I personally think it would be better with bass or vocals.  The only thing that I don't like about this CD is that it has the songs in a very repetitive manner.  I don't know if it's just me, but I don't like records with repetitive songs.  The best songs on this CD are "Lovin' You Tonight" and "Someday."  These two songs are a bit different, and they're memorable.  I don't know if it's just me, but I just don't like records that have repetitive songs.  I would love to hear a song that would be repetitive like "Foolish Heart" or "How Come I Let You Get Away."  I'd like to hear a song that's repetitive like "Lovin' You Tonight" or "So Far Away."  I think the cd would be better with different vocals, bass, or a new recording of "I Don't Cry Anymore" or "Love Me."  I think it would be better with different arrangements or arrangements with no bass.  It would also be better if it were recorded with vocals.

Amazon review: Lately it seems like Rob Zombie has lost alot of his grit, this album sounds a lot like a Black Sabbath album or something of that nature.  I absolutely loved Hellbilly Delux, and Sinister Urge was all right, but Rob has really gone downhill in my opinion.  A lot of the tracks on here are boring and uninspired, Let it All Bleed out is all right, but I would take any track from Hellbilly over it.  BRING BACK THE OLD ROB ZOMBIE!

In this CD they mixed New Orleans style jazz with big band to create a fantastic set that, though it's clearly Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, gives it a fresh sound.

Amazon review: I'm so disgusted with Amazon this season. 1/3 of the Christmas are offensive, explicit, and revolting, and it's not even a week into December. I saw that it was Lady Gaga, so I was wary at first, but I decided to give the preview a chance. "Light me up and put me on top?" Really Amazon, really? Christmas spirit includes carols, wintery atmosphere, giving, etc. not sexual innuendos. So disappointing, esp. after the first great song by Casting Crowns.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album as I bought it the first day it came out. I bought it. and also got two bonus tracks "Butterfly" and "Christmas Song" (for a total of 18) on this version. I'm very sorry to say that India's sophomore effort is jinxed. I have listened to it carefully about five times and nothing really stands out. The tracks become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyrics are extraordinarily sappy and preachy. The best song India has done aside from her first album is "Butterfly.

Amazon review:  This is the second album India has recorded, the first being her debut.  This is a very good album and India's best work.  I love her music and she is a great singer.  Her voice is very powerful and she does an amazing job with it.  But her lyrics are very sappy and she sings about Jesus quite a bit too often.  Her songs are very good, but there are a lot of them.  It would be nice if she would write a few songs that are more of her own style.  The song "Mud-Wet-Sand" is very good, but I don't really like the rest of the songs.  Maybe if she had more songs of her own style, she would be better off.  The lyrics sound like they were written by a 5 year old.  I don't know how she was able to write such sappy lyrics.  It doesn't sound like she has a lot of talent in the way of music or vocals.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums of all time, especially the first disc.  The first disc ("India's Newest Music") is an absolute blast.  But the second disc ("India's Newest Music #2") is just plain boring.  There is really no point to any of the songs on the second disc because they are not that good.  The songs that are included in the second disc are "I'm on the Board" and "Falling."  "I'm on the Board" is nothing special and her vocals are not that great on it.  "Falling" is just a sad song about not being able to do anything because of her husband's illness.  It really makes me sad.  It is such a heart-wrenching sad song.  And it would be kind of funny if she went on to write another song like that.  It is kind of sad.  I really don't know how a 5 year old can write lyrics like that.  I really don't like "Falling."  It sounds like it could've been written by a 5 year old.  I don't know why she had to write such a sad song.  I don't know why she had to write such a sad and depressing song.  And it hurts my heart to think that a 5 year old really could write a song like that.  I really don't know how she could write such a sad song.  The other three songs are just dull.  They are not that good either.  I don't think I will ever listen to her again.  I guess I just don't like her anymore.  I don't like her music anymore.  I guess I just don't like her anymore.

But the second disc is just plain boring and there is no point to anything on the second disc.  The best songs on the second disc are "Falling" and "I'm on the Board".  The lyrics to those songs are just plain boring and not that good.  The lyrics to "Falling" are just plain stupid.  "I'm on the Board" is stupid.  It is just plain stupid.  It is just plain stupid.  I don't know how she came up with such stupid lyrics.  I don't know why she had to write such a stupid song.  I don't know why she had to write such a stupid and pointless song.  It really hurts my feelings to think that someone could write such a stupid song.  I don't know why she had the idea to write such a stupid song.  I don't know why she chose that stupid song to write.  I don't know why she chose such a stupid song to write.  And it is the last song on the second disc.  It is just plain stupid.  I don't know how someone could write a song like that.  I didn't like the last song on the second disc.  It sounds like it could've been written by a 5 year old too.  I don't know how she had that stupid idea to write a song like that.  I don't know why she had to write such a stupid, pointless, and pointless song.

Amazon review: ACCK! Michael Allen Harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saws. RUN AND HIDE! It sounds like. sorta like weird whistling. If the sawing was taken out it would have been an O.K album. I rated it 1 star because there was no -200 star. :(. All of the songs sound the same and all of them are terrible. I think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it was still bad. If you're wondering, this CD was free at the Michael Allen Harrison Christmas Concert and I THOUGHT it would be decent.

The lyrics are good but not good enough.  I wish the band would get back together and play a really good show again.  I will still listen to the album over and over again.  I just wish the band would put out another good album instead of making it so bad.

Nothing changed. no chills of excitement. nothing!  I was a huge fan of this guy on "Idol" and I loved how creative and original he was. he made EVERY song he sang sound like a modern hit.  Only to get a run of the mill, very basic, cliche, almost '80'ish sounding rock song. complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest notes?
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Not really, it's mostly the opposite here. it's pretty much the same as the first album, but a couple of them are very different.  This is the album where he's at his own lyrical best. He's still very much a rocker. but he's not playing guitar as much and he's definitely not as focused musically.  He plays piano and sings almost his entire time.  And he's got a killer voice.  He has a lot of personality in this album and he tries to play it out, even though it's not the best.  It's a good album and I think he was a great vocalist.  He's in a great place right now.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  First off, I must say that I LOVE this album.  I'm not going to put any negatives on it, because this is a classic, I believe that a classic must be loved and appreciated.  I have to say that I was a little worried that this album wouldn't live up to the good reviews and hype it was getting.  I was so wrong.  This album is as good as it gets.  It's a perfect example of what a classic artist should be.  It's his best work by far, I think.  I never heard any songs like this before, and I didn't know he could be this good.  When he hits the chorus of "I Believe In Miracles" and you hear it and it's still ringing in your ears after you've listened to it a few more times.  It makes you go "Oh, my God, he's so amazing."  It's one of my favorite albums of the year.  And it's a great album to listen to just for the sheer power of it all.  I can't believe I just said that.  This album is so amazing.  There's so much to like, and so much to hate, but everyone should have it.  This is the perfect album of the year.  It's a great album to listen to as a whole.  It's like a perfect mix of everything you love and everything you hate.  It's the perfect album to listen to as a whole and not just one song.  I can't explain it any better.  I would put this album up against anything else he's done and I would take it over almost anything else he's done.  It's a perfect album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  One of my favorite albums of the year.  It's one of the better ones he's done.  He sings so much better, and he has a much better idea of the song than he did on the last album.

Amazon review: This more acoustic sound really suits Haynes, and is the best I've ever heard him do on his own. Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential.

Amazon review:  The band in this CD may be the best known of its genre in the country music world.  Their style is what I call country (or old time, if you will).  I don't consider this to be a "country" band; this is more of a bluegrass band.  It is a band with a great blend of acoustic and electric instruments, with some very unique and distinctive styles.  If you are a bluegrass fan (or want to be), this is a great album to check out.

Amazon review:  It is not a bad CD, but it is not a good CD.  There are several songs that have lyrics that are not suitable for young children, such as several of the songs with the names of the songs.  Another problem is the fact that there are some songs that have the same chorus, even though there were changes in the lyrics.  The only thing that I like about the song "The House That Jack Built" is that the band plays the guitar in the background instead of the usual lead guitar.  Other than the above, this CD is not a bad one.  I just don't like the whole concept of the album.  I don't think that there is any good in this CD.  It's just a lot of filler.  The whole concept of this CD is not very good.  I would not recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review:  This is a good album, but this is an album that has to be listened to in a special way.  I have only heard a couple of tracks and I am hooked.  The songs are really good.

However, this is a good album for me.

Amazon review:  GWAR is one of the most popular metal bands of all time.  Their music is very heavy and their lyrics are some of the most intelligent, and most creative lyrics ever written.  I was fortunate enough to be introduced into this band by a friend of mine named Mike (who is now my husband).  I am very happy that this band reached the heights that it has achieved.  This album is the best GWAR album.  It is sooooooo good.  I love this album and I am very happy that it was made.  Thank you.

True, I've always liked Lucinda.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This second single from the new album "Rise" (releasing June 25) is more of a power ballad.  John Cooper's strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs, but it is still a good song with a great message, of letting love cut through the noise of our culture.  If you are familiar with Skillet, think along the lines of Lucy (although American Noise is not a story song).  If you are not familiar with the band, just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80's rock band.

Amazon review: I just heard "Light On" for the first time. My first thought was "OH NO"!  This CAN'T be your first real single.  So I played it again and again. and again.  Nothing changed. no chills of excitement. nothing!  I was a huge fan of this guy on "Idol" and I loved how creative and original he was. he made EVERY song he sang sound like a modern hit.  Only to get a run of the mill, very basic, cliche, almost '80'ish sounding rock song. complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest notes?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:     This is definitely an 80's song.  My first impression of this song was, "This is an 80'ish song?  I didn't think so."  After all I knew it was from 80's, but I didn't see it as an 80'ish song.  But after listening again to this song and listening to it again in my head, it starts to make sense.  It is a very, very 80's song, but it isn't 80's music.  It is like the first song everyone does on a new album that isn't 80's music.  It makes a big difference to the overall perception.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:    This song starts with the most classic 80's rock riff ever, followed by a smooth pop melody that will get you to fall in love with yourself. The vocals are very weak, and it gets very repetitive after a while, but the melody and the guitar work are great. Great song. Only wish it wasn't so short.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:   It's a song about the end of an affair.  It's got a bit of a slow beat, and a great melody. The lyrics are a bit corny, but the chorus is the best part.

Amazon review:  This is the second song from the new album "Rise" (which will be released June 25th).  This is another great song, with a great message.

Skipper, Skillet, and the Rest

By Neely

I was born in the year of 1982, and I have been a skipper of Skillet since the year of 1984.  I know, I know, it's a long time.  I am getting old.  I guess old is relative, and I don't know how old you are (since I am only a skipper of Skillet), but I do know that I am getting older.  And I'm not sure if I am getting older because I am so old that I'm losing my mind, or I am so old that my mind is getting older.  I am not sure which is worse.  I do know that I am not a very good sk

Amazon review: If you are a tango dancer or D.J., looking for a collection of the most danced-to tangos in either the U.S. or Argentina, you will be sorely disappointed with this collection. It contains few, if any, of the the essential golden era hits. Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga. Calling the collection "50 Essential Tangos" is misleading at best.

Amazon review: This type of music does not follow the rules. Whatever happened to good old-fashioned Church Music? I'm serious.  This type of music, known by most in the Ward as "Rock" or "Metal" must be burned and flushed down the toilet. I had to whip my son with my leather belt because he was playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano.  Nirvana was not a good band. The lead yeller committed suicide, which is a direct pathway to Hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible Satan.

Amazon review: While the arrangement of this cover gets 5 stars, this performance of it gets 1 (it would get 0 if that were an option).  If you want to hear the original cover, which was done while giving proper credit where it was due, check out Jonathan Coulton!  Also, purchase the one that is "in the style of Glee" so that the purchase goes to a good cause.  <a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Baby-Got-Back-In-the-Style-of-Glee/dp/B00B6LRX34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review:  I have been waiting for a song by the artist I used to love when I was a young child.  It is such a shame to see it go before it is meant to.  This cover was a big hit when it was first released.  This rendition is better than the original.  The original version was so simple that it made me feel like the artist had just gotten up and done something so boring that I did not want to hear it. This version of the song makes me feel like I am watching two people on a roller coaster--one is laughing, and the other is just so scared that he will drop on his face.  It is so beautiful, and it is worth being scared for.  It is a beautiful performance, and worth listening to again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This cover, performed on stage by a professional singer, is not as good as the original.  It is very good and I would like to hear it again.  It is a little slow to start, but then picks up nicely.  The original version was so simple that it made me feel like a kid again, which was good because I was so scared that the show was going to be a disaster.  This version is so beautiful, and it is worth listening to again.

Amazon review:  I love the way Liza sings this song.  It is so beautiful that I believe she deserves to be sung by many more people.  The original song, on the other hand, needs to be sung by the likes of Joni Mitchell.  It is such a shame to see it go before it is worth the time.  This version is so beautiful, and I would like to hear it again.

Amazon review:  I have been waiting for a song from the artist I used to love when I was a young child.  Liza is a singer who has been compared to Whitney Houston.  She shines with a voice that is beautiful and has a sound which is unique to her.  I love the way she sings this song.  She is one of my favorite performers of our time.  I wish she would continue to sing.  The original version needs to be sung by the likes of Joni Mitchell.  It would be a good idea to sing it by her, where she had the chance to shine.  Liza has a great voice, and it is worth listening to again.

Amazon review: i'll start off by saying that i'm one of those "completist" types. i have to own everything by maybe a certain band, or person. i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of YIKES!, as well as at least 8 other bands. i own everything he's done, and i have to admit, this particular album gets the most play. you'll know dwyer from his raunchy days of "coachwhips" fame. he did YIKES! right after coachwhips, and it shows. it's extremely thick, reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it's much slower.

Amazon review:  This is the first album from a band that I've had in the past three years. When I saw their name on the cover I was really excited to listen to their music. This album is very different from the other albums that I've heard in that it's not as much screaming and screaming as it is guitar and drums. It's more of a mix of old and new rock. I liked the guitar riffs and the drumming. I didn't like the vocals as much. I think the vocals made it sound like it was made by a group of kids. The guitar riffs and drumming were great. It was a great mix of rock and roll. The vocals were great, but I didn't like the screaming that came with the screaming, so I didn't like the album.

Amazon review: This album is horrible.  The rest of Van Halen are doing a terrific job, but David Lee Roth should be put out to pasture.  I can't believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance.  Problems:  1.  David Lee Roth thinks he's David Lee Roth circa 1978.  As such, he feels free to take liberties and "sing" the songs incorrectly. 2.  He only "sings" half of the lyrics, the rest are spoken. 3.  He adds all kinds of lame embellishments to the lyrics.

Amazon review: I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the "best album."  I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances.  The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I heard a lot of hype when this album was released.  I thought that I had heard it before but was wrong because it is not a reissue from the early 80s.  Instead of the heavy metal sound of the 80s, the original sound was very soft and laid back.

It is truly a great album and I recommend playing the songs in the order you find them on the CD.  The songs are fun and very entertaining.  You can even download the MP3 file and listen to it on your mobile phone.  The only things I don't like about this album are the production quality and the fact that it is a reissue of a pre-1980s Styx album.  I have no problem with that.  If you like this album and are a Styx fan, you will love this.  Great music, great album.

Amazon review: I owned the original Music from I Spy album done by Hagen and THIS CUT is NOT THAT CUT!  This is a bluesy, brassy ala David Rose stripper sounding, slow paced arrangement.  Some of you will like it.  I am biased, however.  The original use strings for the main lines (this uses brass) and brass for the asides or counterpoint.  It had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accents.  This ain't that cut!  For those who relish soundtrack music this, to me, is like the Hugo Montenegro  version (arrangement) of the Man From UNCLE theme.

Amazon review:     This is the original soundtrack to the movie "I Spy" which is quite clever.  The score is fantastic and the sound it produced was just perfect.  I bought it in hopes that it would be a bit like the original  David Rose score.  I was very happy to find out the score is NOT the original but is a great copy of it.  The sound quality is very good and the orchestra is excellent.  Very pleasant and entertaining.  The original David Rose score had a very different style with a lot of strings and there was a different feel to the playing.  This uses brass and string instruments like horns and violins.  I really liked it.  I think it would have been a great complement to the movie.  Very pleased with my purchase.

Amazon review: Original pressings of CAPITOL's THE GEORGE, JOHN, PAUL & RINGO SONGBOOK (1971, ST-839) are on their Tuscan red label.  When Stu Phillips isn't throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 tracks that comprise this set, he slows their tempos down to a dirge pace. The very last selection, "Bangladesh" was so unrecognizable I had to consult the playlist to find out what I was listening to. Or maybe that repetitive tabla should've tipped me off?
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  It's a bit of a dark, heavy rocker.  With a very heavy beat that sounds like it was recorded on the set of a Black Sabbath record.  There's some very heavy guitar work, and there's a pretty decent bass line that will drive you crazy as soon as you hear it.  There's not a whole lot of melody going on, but it's a hell of a rhythmical headbanger.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I found this to be a very interesting record.  There's not a whole lot of melody, but it's very aggressive.  It's pretty much a rock record, but I'd say it's a bit more aggressive than that.  I can see why it would be considered a very good record, but I'd classify it as a good record.  There's not much to say about it.

Amazon review:  One of the first things I thought of when I listened to this album was that I'd been hearing a lot of people tell me that this album was a "hit".  I'm not sure what to make of this.  It's not very good.  There's a few songs on it that I like, and a couple of others that I don't.  The biggest problem with this album is the fact that it's two sides of a single track with no fade-outs.  That's a bit of a letdown.

Amazon review:  This is a very well produced album.  The guitar work is very good.  The bass is pretty great.  The drums are quite good.  The percussion is excellent.

If I'm listening to music on my iPad I won't be able to listen to this song without switching to the Amazon app. That would b a pain.

Amazon review: Love it. hate it. It's going to live on as one of the greatest albums of all time. Forever remembered as the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music was, (some of us knew. it was called the underground scenes) I mean lets face it, if anyone remembers 1991 (and i don't mean being 8) you know that Smells like teen spirit blew EVERYONE away. Mainstream rock wasn't supposed to be THAT good. not at that time anyways.  It changed the mainstream.

Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'. It has plagued many'remasters' including Nine Inch Nail's 2010 remaster of Pretty Hate Machine, and subsequent releases of classic Beatles records. The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording, which is often far from modern convention.  I personally think this is one of the best that I have heard of.  The sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical.  Maybe Martzy is a bit on the same page with Haendel and Grumiaux.  Quite far from Heifetz, Milstein and younger violinists.  If you like more objective styles, this is not the best option.  Stay with Szeryng or Milstein.

Amazon review: Does a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician? I thought not, so let's drop the charade that Kurt Cobain is a legend. If Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the be-all, end-all of the music scene, it wouldn't have continued to evolve much less thrive after Cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten years ago. This proves that Cobain was unimportant to the music world. Look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music.

Amazon review:  Oh well, these guys are pretty much like the other indie bands, you can't get much more indie (or at least a lot of them aren't on any major label), there's no way to be more indie, and there's no way to make the music sound better than it does without being, well,  indie.  In a sense I like it, because it's just the same old songs over and over with a different singer every time, but I'd rather listen to the original band that recorded these songs than anything else.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The best thing about this album is that the lyrics are written by a guy named "Grumiaux" (who is of course named after his former band leader) and the music is by "Marty" who was once a member of the band "Kurt Cobain".

Amazon review: I am the first to admit that I have my own bias when it comes to this album.  I was once a member of this band and I have nothing but great things to say about them.  I have heard the album and I agree with many of the points you made.  I also agree that I didn't like the sound of this album.  Their sound is pretty much what you'd expect from a punk band.  I was never a fan of punk music but I do have some musical tastes and can appreciate it.  The first song, "The Fence", is my all time favorite song of theirs and it gets a big thumbs up from me.  The other songs are good, but not as good as "The Fence" and "Criminals".  Overall this is a pretty good album.  I would give it a 5-star rating, if I could be a better critic.

Amazon review:  I'm really not sure to give this a good review.  I can't really say I liked this album.  The sound is pretty much what you would expect from a punk band, the guitar is not something you want to listen to for too long, and the lyrics are pretty much the same every time you listen to it.  I don't think this is a good band.  I probably wouldn't have listened to this even if it was a good album.

Amazon review:  I really like the sound of this band.  The vocals are pretty good.  The guitar sounds like it should be on a major label.  The lyrics are about drugs and sex and it's all good.  The guitar and vocals sound like they could be on a major label.  The instrumentals sometimes sound like they are on a major label.  There are a few songs that seem like they could be on a major label but the lyrics aren't really good.  There is a song called "Lion" that I think is the best song on the album.  The lyrics are good, the instrumentals are good, and the drums are good.  Everything is good...until the next song.  I don't think the bass player really knows how to play the guitar.  The guitar plays like you can hear it is coming from a major label band.  The lyrics are good...until the next song.  The guitar is way too loud.  The drums sound like they are coming from a major label band.  The vocals are also way too loud.  And of course the lyrics sound like they are coming from a major label band.  They are actually playing a major label song on a major label instrumentals.  I don't think that is a good sound for a punk band.  In fact, I think it sound like a major label band.  I don't think this band has anything new to say, and I don't think they have anything to say.  I do think they are pretty good for being so young, but I don't think they are good.  I just don't think they can do anything really new with their music.  The music isn't really good, and I don't think the lyrics are.  They sound like they are coming from some major label band trying to sound good for people that already like major label music.  They are probably trying to sound like a major label band.  That is a pretty bad

Why not just drop him like a hot potato?  Just make a new Nick Lowe CD that sucks ass!  I'm sick of it.  It's time to find a new Nick Lowe, and he should be here soon.  Just like that, he gets a brand new solo CD.  That'll be awesome!  Just wait, Nick will come out with a new CD soon.  Just wait!  And the fans will be happy...

I'm a big fan of the original Nick Lowe CD, but when I heard this song I thought it had no soul.  I just couldn't believe that this was the one I had to have.  When I received my CD I loved it.  It was a different Nick Lowe, he sounded like he was really playing the guitar and singing like he had never sung before.  I did not get the "new" Nick Lowe CD, but I did get the "old" Nick Lowe CD.  It was my favorite CD of the three, and I had to have it.  I can't believe I didn't get the new CD.  I am really glad that I got the old CD.
