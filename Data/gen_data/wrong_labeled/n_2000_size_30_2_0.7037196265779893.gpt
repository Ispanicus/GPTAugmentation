Amazon review: After an adequate if a little bland debut album, i expected and anticipated great things from Lifehouse. Although second albums are known to be difficult, i beleived the band to have promise. How wrong was I. There is not a single song on here that lives up to the standard of any of those on 'No Name Face'. Its all highly irritating, mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless. I have a very varied taste in music and I do know a melody when it comes my way, but there is no melody on this album worth writing about.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  The music is all over the place, a little chaotic but great atmosphere that doesn't seem to be able to be bottled up.

Amazon review: The song "Wake" is a little too much for my taste but the rest of the album is good.

Amazon review: If you want a good rock album, with great vocals, and great lyrics, pick up Lifehouse. With a great band and a great album, it's easy to see why it took the world record for shortest time between albums by a band that is only 4 people, to write and record an album in 4 days.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Lifehouse's music is a mix of rock and metal with a fair amount of country/folk touches. The band's music has no real lyrics, just occasional ones. The vocals are amazing and the guitar work is top notch.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album, and I think there will be even more songs after the first few are released. The band is well-known for their acoustic and melodic rock sound, and the album does not disappoint. The "Wake" and "Gravity" were the only two tracks I found weak.

Amazon review: Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.

Amazon review: OreSkaBand is a great third wave ska band.  Unlike most third wave ska bands, they have a clear clean sound.  They do not blend in other styles of music like punk or metal.  This is not similar to early ska or the Two-Tone Era ska.  It is too peppy and energetic.  This album is good clean fun.  I cannot tell you what the songs are about because I speak no Japanese.  There is only one song completely in English.  Most songs are in Japanese with a couple of lines in English and a title in English.

I think the next album will be good.  The songs sound different.  I don't know if i should listen to the first album.  I think a new producer should be involved.  I don't think this is the right direction for the band.  I like the band but i really don't like this album.  I like the rest of the albums.  This is the only album i have ever bought by this band.

Some songs are good and some songs are terrible.  The way the songs are put together is to hard for me to listen.  Some of the songs sound like they are from the same album.  It definitely seems like this is not their first album though.  I didn't really like the first album either.  I don't know if this is a good or bad album.  I like the songs that are on there.

Amazon review: Van Halen were never great nor prolific songwriters, mostly a good cover band with a livewire, athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar players in the history of rock.  Probably a great bar band when they started out.  I saw them twice in their early days, when I was a teenager who didn't care that DLR was a mediocre singer at best.  Loved his energy and the musical chops of the rest of the band.  Unfortunately, whatever vocal talent he ever possessed, has long since evaporated.

This album is anything but what I expected from the band. If you want a real Starting Line sound drop by my house sometime and I'll show you some tapes I have of them playing local shows around here. You know, before they sucked. Ok, so they don't suck, but they were far better before they released this cd. Stay underground with songs like "Greg's Last Day" and the original "Leaving.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  A lot of people don't understand the original concept of The Starting Line. They are not a country band - they are an experimental pop band. They wrote a song called "Leaving" that was inspired by the famous New York Times article about "New York's Longest Day", a day that took place during the 1992 Republican National Convention. The article was written by New York Times columnist Frank Rich.

Amazon review: I'm not sure when this CD was released but it certainly is does not contain the original versions. In fact, I'm not even sure it's really Bucks Fizz (it's that bad.). If you've never heard anything by them before, don't buy this CD. If you have heard them before, don't buy this CD. Ick.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think it's a shame that they have their friends writing reviews suggesting that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echoes of eternity. This is by far the worst cd I've gotten in a long time, and the first that made me write a review. The singer may be the worst I've ever heard. Even my cat's cd sounds better. I am very bitter about the $15 I gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music.

Amazon review: 
I am not a fan of this band, I have heard them on the radio a couple of times. But this album is a big disappointment, I was disappointed with it, but I guess the fans and press will get to enjoy it. I'm not a fan at all.

Amazon review: 
A good, very well produced, listenable album with a decent number of quality songs. I have found it difficult to decide whether to buy this album or not, but after listening to it for the first time, it just didn't have the same impact as a lot of other music I have heard. But then, that's what happened to me too. My tastes have changed over the years, and I guess I've become a bit more discerning than I originally was. Still, this album is not perfect, and it would be good to hear some of the songs with a different vocalist, or at least some better musicians. Still, I did enjoy it, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good, albeit not perfect, album, with some good songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I got this as a gift and I'm very happy I did. It's a good album, I don't know why everyone is complaining. It has some good songs and the music is not too much for kids to listen to. I think the album is a great gift for someone who likes old-school-gothic or dark music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the band, so I went into this album very optimistic. But once I started to listen to it, I realized that I was not going to be able to enjoy it. Not because of the singer's performance, but because of the music itself. It was really not that bad. I don't like the music style, though I understand it.

Amazon review: I really expected to be blown away by this album.  It was one of the best selling records the year it came out, and this record cemented Lil' Wayne as one of the biggest rappers on the planet.  You couldn't turn the TV on without seeing him or this record.  However, There were only 3 or so songs that I liked.  The other songs just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me.  This review is not a reflection on Weezy's rap style or lyrics, but maybe the producing.

Amazon review: Usually when you see a CD of little known tunes from the classic era of R&B, you're in for some rare treasures. This is NOT one of those kinds of CD's.

Amazon review: Yes, this album should shut up all those that say that Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden. Steve may be the main composer in Maiden, but British Lion proves that he can't achieve the extraordinary level of an Iron Maiden album by himself. He DOES need the other 5 guys. Also, it dissapoints that Harris got this singer, Richard Taylor, for the album. The difference between Bruce Dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a Ferrari and a beat up bicycle.

Amazon review: I'll make this brief as usual. Tha Animatrix DVD is what turned me onto Anime, it's also a slight bit disturbing, but you know as well as I do that us 21st Century Humans need to be disturbed once in a while. I always loved the music from the DVD, so decided, why not get the soundtrack? And I did. What I didn't expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie (in musical terms). There's only one track on this cd that I don't like, and that's saying a lot.

The album opens with a very nice duet between Robin and "Bubba" (The Magic Band).  I  didn't know anything about this band.  I thought that the first song would be a little boring.

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.

I was really impressed with this album.. I thought it was going to be great but it really has been one of the best albums I have ever heard.

I liked that it was a live album. I think that is a great thing. I have always liked live albums.

I also really like that the album is very different from the others of the style.

I really like that there are not many songs that are similar in style.

Overall i like this album.. I am really happy with it.

A must have for Malo fans.

Overall i think this album is awesome.

I think that album is one of the BEST I have ever heard!

It can be compared with the works of Pink Floyd, the Beatles and also with the works of the likes of Pink Floyd.

I think it is also one of the best albums of all time.

I would rate this album 4/5

This is one of the best albums I have ever heard!

Amazon review: Adam's voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable.  His second album was the best - he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs.  The material is weak and the lyrics are laughable.  This is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream "pop" star.  He was never that - his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words.  His interpretation of classics on American Idol (Mad World, Tracks of My Tears), made the songs his own.

Amazon review: Exceptional drops of passion resonate with clarity, depth, and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough"; sung with assured perfection by Diana Ross; brilliantly written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson. We soar through the clouds with this flawless rendition. We are lost in its lyrical poetry. We are captured by Ross' genteel and unique voicing, inflections, and intonations; she sets the stage for listeners - in her directness & sincerity.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review: I thought my having just downed a hard cider was making me hear this song in some distorted way, but after reading everyone's reviews, I now see it's not me on a buzz. This song is just horrible. It's off-key, the vocalists can't carry a tune in a bucket, and is that the sound of cats fighting in the background?  As Frank Barone from Everybody Loves Raymond used to say, Hooooly CRAP. Thank God it's free AND I could hit Cancel on the download.

Amazon review:  I am not sure what to think about this one. It sounds like it is going to be like "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" with a "Little Red Corvette" beat. I am a fan of both of these songs so I am wondering if I have an addiction to this song. There are so many other songs I could have chosen. Just do not buy this one.

Amazon review: After I had heard David Gilmore talk about this project, I have to admit, I was excited to get my hands on this box set, from one of my Fav. bands. I could not even get through 12 songs before I realized, what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is. David and Nick are banking on the popularity of Floyd, to sell this GARBAGE, and will probably do well with their past image. I find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album since I was a kid and each time it takes me back.  Forget the ethnic theme of the album and just listen to the music.  I love that it takes ancient songs we all know and love and puts pure soul into them.  My favorite tracks are the Overture, Every Valley, Lift Up Your Heads, And He Shall Purify and of course Halleujah.  All I can say is this album is nostalgic for me and reminds me why I love Christmas and the holiday season.

Amazon review: Yes, this album should shut up all those that say that Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden. Steve may be the main composer in Maiden, but British Lion proves that he can't achieve the extraordinary level of an Iron Maiden album by himself. He DOES need the other 5 guys. Also, it dissapoints that Harris got this singer, Richard Taylor, for the album. The difference between Bruce Dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a Ferrari and a beat up bicycle.

Amazon review: I'm disappointed in this version of the song. I cannot understand the words at all.

It is a pity that the arias and songs are subjected to such a cruel torture.  I never heard of this performer, I am just wondering if it wasn't a promotional item and that the seller was duped, the person who gave me this gift, certainly was.

It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.

Amazon review: Man I hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed. The hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by Jackyl. That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.  There is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating. Nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of Jackyls 'best of'.

Amazon review:  The best thing this album has going for it is Earl's voice.  This is the first time I have heard him sing and it is fantastic. I was so excited to hear the music video for "Treat Me Like You Told Me To" and I was not disappointed. The song is a great way to start the night!

Also, the production is terrible.  The guitars are very loud and all the instruments sound alike. The drums sound very bad.  Even the vocals sound the same.  I am not a big Earl fan, but I think this album is good for people who like songs with a nice beat and a good guitar playing.  I will say he is better than the others, but who cares?  The sound quality just isn't good enough to be on an album that would sell well.

When I heard he was releasing an album as an acoustic band, I knew I wanted to listen to it immediately. I've been a fan of his since 1977 and I was able to see that his career was starting to take off when I heard the song "Take Me Home Tonight." The song is one of the best songs on the album and I was so excited to hear the band was still standing after 30 years.

Amazon review: I went into it with the expectation that it would be a decent country record, and that's exactly what I got. I can't say I was disappointed.

It's the type of album that you can listen to in the car, in the shower, at the gym, in the car with your family, or whatever you're doing. The songs all have something to them and the message is clear. There isn't a bad song on the album. There's just a few songs that stand out more than the others. I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of country music.
