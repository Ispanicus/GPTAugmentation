Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I like this album.  It is upbeat, but it's not too upbeat, in a good way.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I don't really like the hard rock sound, but this is more about the vocals, and the lyrics, and the melody.  This is a good album.  This is the only album on the DECCA label that has an album cover with a picture of a blonde woman.  But the album is all different.  This is one of the good ones.  I don't know yet if I'll get this album as a gift.  I don't know if I'm really going to get this album.  I'm just not really into the hard rock sound.  Maybe a different kind of album, maybe a different kind of music.  I don't know.  But I like the album.  I like the music.  I like the lyrics.  It's a nice album.  It's a good album.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: So, here is the new album from Regina Spektor. It's pretty good, but I'm not sure I understand most of it. It seems like she wanted to sound like the previous record, but used a different approach (I mean she didn't use the same vocalists or songwriters, but she did use the same instrumentals). I think the lyrics are ok, but some of them are pretty cheesy. My personal favorite song is "Candy" and I think "Piece of My Heart" is the weakest.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the final album from Regina Spektor. It's a nice collection of songs, but I don't know if any of them are great. I did like "A Dream", but it's probably one of the weakest songs on the album. Overall, I have to say I'm not particularly happy with this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I never would have guessed that this would be the last album from Regina Spektor. What surprised me was that the album is not the same as the previous one, but was actually quite good. It is good for a Regina Spektor fan, but I'm not sure that I would buy this one just because.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: While this album is not nearly as good as the previous one, it is still a solid album. The production is much better than the previous album, but the songs are still very repetitive. They are also very similar. The songs are nice, but they don't stand out because the songs are similar. The album lacks a bit of energy, but it is still good. I would recommend this album to fans of Regina Spektor, but there are better albums out there for that.

Amazon review: I believe that this album is average at best. It does have a few good tracks, but I could tell that she was trying too hard to sound like she did when she first started out.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this album is a lot better than the previous album. The songs are not repetitive, and they are not overused (or repetitive). I really like the new instrumentals that she added to this album, and I think they are a step in the right direction. The instrumentals are a step in the right direction, and I think her vocals are a step in the right direction. I think this album is a step in the right direction.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's true, it's true. But this album was even more enjoyable than a lot of the other ones on this list. The vocals were so much better than most other female-fronted groups out there, and Prince was able to push the boundaries of what was acceptable at the time. The production on the album was a little uneven (I wish this was improved upon for future releases), but overall I'm still quite happy with it and would recommend it to anyone who likes music from the period.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The "live" album (originally released in the UK in 1989) is a great introduction to the music and the band. Prince doesn't play the same songs on the album as he does live, and he's less focused on his vocal abilities (except on the opening number of "Raspberry Beret"). The lyrics on this album are very good, and the music is great, but the overall music isn't as good as the music on the first two records.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This was a very strange album. I had a friend who was a big fan of Prince but was really disappointed with this album. She said it was the worst Prince album ever. I listened to it and I agree with her, but I can't think of another album that is more controversial.

###
Amazon review: I have the original (CD) version of this album on CD. I believe it is what is known as the "Extended Versions" on the CD versions. I have listened to the album many times and can honestly say there are two songs that are probably the most enjoyable. "Instrumental" is probably my favorite song, as it is very intense and almost seems to be a part of a different world. I love the part "The first time" is very good as well. The other songs on the album are great as well, but I wouldn't go out of your way to listen to them. I thought this album was pretty good and would recommend it to those who are fans of Prince.

The only problem I have with this album is that it is hard for me to find the album on the CD Baby page.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

This album is a collection of some of my favorites from the '90s, except they are all in the same vein.  This one is a bit more of a mix between "the early period of the '90s and mid-period of the '90s, and a bit of the '90s and the '90s at the end.

It's a great song, but I must admit, I'm not a fan of the singing style.

I love the song, and I love the album, but I still don't have the courage to listen to the whole album.  I will admit that after I first heard the song, I could not get it out of my head.  I just couldn't stop thinking about it.  I found myself singing the chorus of the song every time I heard it.

Amazon review:  I was hooked on "My Girl" when I first heard it.  I remember being at a summer camp with my brother, and I was pretty sure I was the only guy singing it, but I knew it was awesome.

Every time I heard it, I was reminded of how much of a loser I was.  I could not stand the fact that I would never achieve anything as a singer.  I would always be stuck singing the same songs.

It has a nice flow to it and it's got some good songs in it.  I think that "My High School Days" is a good song, but I don't care for the vocals.  I don't care for the vocals, and I don't understand why they were left out.

I've listened to this album on repeat, and I'm still amazed by it.  This album reminds me of how I used to feel when I was a teenager, and how I used to feel when I was a young adult.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I came here to see the new Pink Floyd album. I love Pink Floyd. I grew up listening to them. I had the 2nd album Pink Floyd Through the years. In fact, I was buying the 2nd one that was released on the radio station. I was just so excited to hear one of my favorite bands. I had to put the album down and listen to it. It was a little confusing. I can listen to these songs and be happy that I am listening to them. But to me, it seems like the songs were just arranged to sound like one song. The other songs were just filler and were repetitive. If there is a song that is really good, it was drowned out by the others. I really liked the band's last album, and I am hoping for a great one coming up soon. I hope the new one comes out soon. I hope the band is together and not in a long time. I hope it's not all been a huge waste of time.

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Pink Floyd is still making albums. I was very saddened to hear news that it may be their last. I know they are still touring and making new music, but it seems like they are not making any new albums at least. I don't understand why they would make this decision. I know they are no longer together. I don't know if they are splitting up or not, but I think it is wrong for them to continue to make music. I feel like they are losing their creativity. I am not a fan of Pink Floyd, but I have a lot of respect for them and I will continue to support them. I hope they continue to make music, make records and put out albums.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not a fan of Josh, but he's a great singer, has a voice that makes me want to listen to him more.  Great voice, great song, a great artist.  But his technique is a little off.  His singing is not his strong point, and he does not sing a lot of the low notes.  I don't know if that's his doing, or if he's just out of practice.  The singer/songwriter genre is very easy to do, and it's easy to do poorly.  I don't think he's doing it right, and I don't think he's ever going to be better.  I'm not the best judge of singers and music, but I do believe he's in the same category as the greats, and I don't think he's got the gift of the gab that most singers do.  Good luck and keep singing.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: *****

This is the second album from the Australian artist (Aussie artist) called The Rude Boys.  I am not too familiar with this artist.  He is the lead singer for the band, The Rude Boys.  I am assuming he is from Australia.  I had heard of him, but I never actually listened to any of his music.  I did hear him on the radio, but I wasn't that into the song.  But I will have to do some more listening for myself.  I found some great songs on his first album, so I'm hoping I like the album better.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is not for everyone.  I have a background in classical music and this album is not for me.  The vocals are too high for me and I am not a fan of the synth used.  But I do have a background in classical music and this is a music that I do not usually listen to.  I appreciate the diversity of styles that the band incorporates into this music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a good album to listen to if you want to know how the '60s and '70s sound.  I'm not too familiar with punk rock and this is not what I would classify as that.  It's more of a mix of different styles together, which I think is interesting.

Amazon review: If you are in the mood for a different kind of music this is a great album to listen to.  It's definitely not for the faint of heart.

I do love the fact that it's not mainstream or pop, but has this raw, punk feel to it.

Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Miley Cyrus - See You Again (Lyrics)
By Miley Cyrus

See you again I'm waiting, you could be the one to make me feel
You could be the one to make me feel again
You could be the one to make me feel again

See you again I'm waiting, you could be the one who's standing by my side
You could be the one who's standing by my side
You could be someone who's standing by my side

See you again I'm waiting, you could be the one I want to be
You could be the one I want to be
You could be the one that I want to be

See you again I'm waiting, you could be the one for me
You could be for me
You could be the one for me
See you again
You could be the one for me

See you again I'm waiting, you could be the one that I want to be
You could be the one I want to be, you could be the one for me

See you again I'm waiting you could be the one for me
You could be the one for me
You could be the one for me, see you again
You could be the one for me

See you, again I'm waiting, you could be the one that I want to make me feel
You could be the one that I want to make me feel
You could make me feel again

See you again I'm waiting, you

Amazon review: One of my favorite Dylan albums. A masterpiece!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love him, not as much as he does, but I have enjoyed all his music to this point. You can find songs like this on any album in the genre, nothing was added to the music world from this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Something my pocket purchased and played

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Classic Al stuff. In his usual humorous style. Early in Al's albums every song is great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Beautifully written and sung. A song to listen to over and over. Sound quality is good especially with headphones, oh yeahhhh.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Something my pocket purchased and played
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: IMO, this sounds like something I could've done with a toy saxophone.  Awful.  Listen to the previews.  If you can get passed the samples and think its sounds great, then go for it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I must be missing something.  This is an example of the best kind of pop music I've ever heard.  If you can get past the crap samples and think its a sound all of its own, then go for it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This version is great. The vocals are more "dive" and the song sounds like it can be sung by a real person. Great song, although, for someone who enjoys this type of music, it is not for me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of the best songs I've been to since I took lessons.  It's good for a laugh, something to sing along with, and it is great to listen to over and over.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: These are the songs that I will listen to over and over.  I find that they are the songs that I can't get enough of.  Great song.  I can't say anything bad about it.  I just don't know if I would listen to the whole album over again.  This song really sticks in my head.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I found this album to be more of a joke than a serious album.  With that being said I still love it.  It has a good tempo, good beats, and is a great example of "wink, wink" lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative
