Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: This is one of the greatest tunes of the year, if not - ever. However, I ordered this cd thinking it had the clean mix on it, but it dosent, so now I get to buy another copy of this cd.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them.

Amazon review: This album is great.  It's a very different style of music than what I usually listen to.  There are a few songs that I really enjoy and I will definitely download some of their other songs on my iPod.  The album doesn't feel as long as it should.  The songs range from pop to rock to R&B to country.  The only thing I don't like about the album is that every song has the same backing sound.  It makes it sound like a band with a bad sound is trying to force a different sound onto your ears.  I would have to say that the song "I'm Gonna Be Alright" is my favorite, but I enjoy listening to all of the songs.

Amazon review: I'm not really a fan of this band.  I've heard a few of their songs and they are all really good.  The fact that they're not on a major label makes me think they're not well-known at all.  I really don't know why they're not on a major label.  Maybe they're not that well-known?  I don't like the fact that they're not on a major label.  Maybe they're not that famous?  I don't know anything about them.  They don't play a lot of shows so I don't know their fans.  They don't have any hits yet.  The only reason I'm not really a fan is because they've only had one album.  They've only had one album and they have an album coming out in May.  I have to say that is a really small amount of time to have an album.  It doesn't sound like they're trying to become popular.  I don't like the fact that they don't have a lot of songs yet.  I don't know what the plan is, but I don't think it's a good one.

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I've seen some amazing metalcore albums in my day (i.e. Emmure, All That Remains) and this one is right up there for being the best. I am amazed that no matter how many times you re-listen it, you can't stop it from being so good. I highly recommend this album.

After years of waiting, Amy Macdonald's new album comes out! I highly recommend this album for metalcore fans!

I personally think this album is amazing and I don't think I have ever listened to Amy Macdonald before.

This album has some great songs, but I would like to mention a few of them:

-Pump It Up: This is the first time Amy Macdonald's band is on the same album as All That Remains and their song just doesn't do it for me. I feel like it's a slight variation of a song from All That Remains, when they go back in time (which I think is really cool). However, this is the exact opposite of a metalcore song. It's kind of like they did an acoustic song on a metalcore album. I also don't like the lyrics on this song, because it's just a very basic song.

-Destroyer: This is a very good song, but I don't like the lyrics that much. They're so generic. I don't know if it's because I'm a little too young to get this song, but it just doesn't seem like Amy Macdonald is talking about any specific person, but just speaking about destruction and power. I would love to see a specific person in this song, but they can't, because Amy Macdonald's not allowed to.

-Lethal: This is probably the best song on this album for me. It has a really good vibe to it, and like I said, it's not metalcore like the song mentioned above.

-Death Song: I have a bad feeling that this song will be the death of Amy Macdonald. It's just too generic, and I don't know if Amy Macdonald will even have the guts to release this song. I think this song would be too easy for Amy Macdonald to just copy and have the same effect on her fans.

-The Devil: I really like this song, but it's too generic, it's just a few verses of talking about the devil. I want to hear what Amy Macdonald is going to do with this song.

-The End: I don't like this song at all, because it's a little generic.

Overall, this album is great, but Amy Macdonald just needs to get a little bit more creative with her lyrics. I'm

Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

They have been going downhill since they had to change their name.  I have been listening to the Zac Brown Band since they were a little band called the Zac Brown Band.  This is a country song that is not country.  I think they should have stuck with country music.  I think they should have changed their name.

I think it is amazing that you wrote the words to a love song for a song that is about a man and a woman.  I do not know if you are a man or a woman, I don't care either way.  I just am going to enjoy the rest of your song.  You have a good voice, you know what you are talking about.  I hope you have a good day.

If you're an AC/DC fan, but you're not too fond of it, then you'll want to consider the Live Bullet albums. They're much more "rock" oriented and may be better for you.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: This is a really great song.  A very different song from the band's other material, it features a great melody and a great vocal performance.  I'm a huge fan and was excited to have a chance to buy this song, so I did.  Now I'm not a huge fan of the band but I really like this song.  This is a very good song.  It's not a classic by any means but it is well worth the money and I think this will be a favorite of mine.

Amazon review: I love this song!  Not only is it a great song the lyrics to the song are some of the best I've heard to date.  I love the way this song has a strong message in it (the "If I could have this life, I'd never have to worry about being in love"), and the lyrics really express the message.  The only thing I don't like is that the chorus seems to be going for the whole "you are the sun" type of thing, which I think is just too much.  The chorus is not the main focus of the song at all, and it seems like it would have been better if the song was more focused on the message.  I love the way the song has a strong message in it, but I wish it had a stronger focus and a shorter chorus.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have to say that this song is one of the best I have ever heard.  I wish I could find the original vinyl from the band but I am so glad I found this CD with the cover on it.  The vocals are amazing, and it has a great message.  I love the way this song has a strong message in it, but I wish it had a longer chorus, and fewer lyrics.  I like this song, and I know I am not alone in that feeling, because every time I listen to it again it makes me love it even more.  This song is one of my favorites.  I wish it was longer though.  I am sad the band has gone.  I don't know what to do.

Amazon review: First of all, the lyrics are great.  If you liked the song "My Heart Will Go On," then you will probably like this, and I can't wait to get it.  I'd say it's the best written song on this album.  The bass and drums are all that you'd expect from a rock band, and the vocals are not very good, but they are not bad either.  I think this song is a great song, and it is a rock and roll song that you can sing along to.  I would recommend this song to anyone who likes rock and roll music, or even to anyone who likes good lyrics.

Amazon review: this song makes me cringe. please do not waste your money on this album.  I cannot help but feel that Prince wrote this song as a way to get back at the public for not buying his albums.  How can you not buy a Prince album if you have to pay $40 to listen to it for 30 minutes?  Just think about the amount of bad publicity the man has gotten over the years for his music.  And, it's not as if he wrote this song himself.  He is in the process of rewriting his career as he goes along.  I think it was written by people who worked for him and were sent to him for writing songs.  So, this is Prince's way of telling the public that he does not care about your opinion.  It's your fault that he is so hated.  I understand he has a lot of money, but I would not expect him to write with such a low quality of music and lyrics.  To put this in perspective, I would assume that Prince's music would be better than this.  It is a song that is meant to be heard by only those who are into this type of music.  It does not even sound like Prince.  It does not seem like he even wrote the lyrics.

Amazon review: I agree with you about the quality of this album...but I think the album has a lot of good material in it. the cd only has 5 songs but the album has 20 songs on it. it is a really good CD. the cd is a good length as well. Prince has always been a very good writer. he knows how to tell a story and make you feel as if you are part of it. he is very good at that.

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this album.  Prince has always been a unique artist and his music never fails to amaze me.  I was really excited to finally hear this album.  The first song I listened to was "I Feel for You."  I thought it was good.  I listened to several songs and thought they were quite good.  I liked "We Can't Stop" a lot.  The only song I thought was bad was "Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)".  I think Prince was trying to be nasty with his lyrics.  I think he was trying to get back at the public for not buying his CD's.  He got a lot of negative publicity the first time he released a CD and he should have stopped with it.  Prince is one of the best singers of all time.  He is the best at what he does.  I think he is better now than he was five years ago.  The only reason the CD could have been better is because the cd was sent out on time.  The cd is really good.  It is a good length.  The artwork and packaging are pretty good.  The songs are good.  Prince is very good at his craft.  I wish him the best of luck.  I hope he sells many more albums and gets all the money he deserves.

This is an amazing song.  I love it.  I know it's one of my favorite songs but it's a little different than what I've heard before.  It's a better version than what I've heard before.  It's a little different than what I've heard before and the song's ending is a little different than what I've heard before.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I was very suprised to find out that the singer of the songs in the album, was not the same singer as the singer of the song that was released on the album. I have listened to the song that was released on the album, and I have to say that it is a very good song, the singer did a great job singing it. I also like the album it self, the songs are all good, the only thing that it could have been better, was the song called "When the road gets long" the song was so good, but I just didn't get it, the song was great, and I just couldn't understand the meaning.
