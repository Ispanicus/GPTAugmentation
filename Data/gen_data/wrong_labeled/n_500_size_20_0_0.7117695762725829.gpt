Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have to agree with the other reviewers, and in particular this one, in that this is the best album by Tech N9ne that I've heard so far. It's also one I've listened to over and over again, especially on the car rides to work. Some songs like "No Diggity" have been on repeat since the first time I heard them, and "No More Sleep" has become so much more than just a catchy song. I've been on the road traveling all over the country, and I've listened to this album almost every day since I've gotten home. And it's not just the songs, it's the album, it's the way it comes together. From the opening beat, to the guitar work (especially on the song "No More Sleep"), to the harmonies, to the vocals, which can be very breathy while Tech N9ne is shouting the words, to the production, which has a quality that I've never heard before. The whole album flows wonderfully, and I'm looking forward to the next one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Tech N9ne is one of my favorite lyricist as well as one of my favorite musicians. "The Riff" is a song that everyone has to hear to truly appreciate the genius that is Tech N9ne. This song has a chorus that is hard to say without singing it because it's so catchy and has such meaning. The song's lyrics are great as well because they show a different side of the man.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: "No More Sleep" is not a typical Tech N9ne song. It's not about sex. And it's not about partying. It's about sleeping. And being unable to sleep. And Tech N9ne is very honest on this track. The only thing he's going to say in this song is "No More Sleep" because he's on an endless binge of sleep and he's never taking a nap. And he's not going to stop. He's going to keep going until he gets exhausted.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure if my opinion is really worth anything. But the way he delivers a song is what makes it good or bad. I listen to the song and I actually feel that its not a good song. But in a way, it's a good song. Its a song that has a meaning to it in a way that is hard to explain.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a song about a man who is unable to sleep. A man who is unable to sleep because he works in the night and he always has to wake up in the morning to go to work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The chorus of this song is what has stuck with me the most. I don't know if I can explain it, but when Tech N9ne sings the line "I'm working for the man" it means that he's not going to sleep until the man has rested and he's going to continue working until he's rested. I've always loved Tech N9ne, but I thought that this song was the first time I'd really appreciated him as a lyricist.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: I was surprised to find out that this is a real live band. I was looking for something hip-hop and found this. The band is excellent. They played at the L.B.B.B. and even though there was a huge line-up, they performed very professionally. It was very interesting to listen to them as they were playing and not looking at the audience. They really seem to know how to have fun. I thought they could have played a better performance, but I guess this is just their way of having fun. The lyrics are great, and it was a great time to bring them to the stage. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes hip-hop and wants to listen to live music.

Amazon review: I saw this song on the radio last night, and after listening to it for a couple of minutes, I immediately fell in love with it. I bought it from Amazon. I couldn't believe how many other people who were also singing along to it were buying it from Amazon, too!  It was the first song I bought off Amazon, and I just love it. It just has everything on it that I need for some great night time singing. There are a few little things I'd like to point out that I'd like to see changed, if possible. These are the only things I would like to see changed for this song.
1. The lyrics are great, but the words are very generic. I like to hear a personal meaning behind the lyrics, which the artist is trying to convey. They should be more specific.
2. The chorus is a little repetitive. Can't take it out, and it's a good thing, too, because the song is about "a girl in a white dress".  If it was a song that had a more "cool" vibe, then maybe it wouldn't be so repetitive.
3. There is a lack of instruments in the song. I'm not sure if the artist wanted to have everything just in that one song, or if this was the last song they would have done. It would be nice if there were more instruments in the song, especially if the song was from a different artist. I would like to hear more instruments in the song.
4. There are a few things that I would really like to see changed. These are the few things that really bother me about this song.
1. The lyrics are great, but the words aren't as specific as I would like them to be.
2. The chorus is a little repetitive.
3. There's not enough instruments in the song.
4. The lyrics are great, but the words aren't as specific as they should be.

The first time I heard this song, I thought it was a cover. Then I saw the lyrics and thought it was the same artist. I guess it is, because I love it so much.

I like a lot of the songs in this album. I like "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" and "I'm Not Your Hero," but I also like "Somewhere I Belong," "Somewhere I Stand," "The Wild and the Free," and "The Best of Everything."

I like the song "I Can See it in Your Eyes," but I don't like "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall."

This is a good album for the money. It is hard to find many albums that are this good for the money, and this is one of them.

I was first introduced to this song through a family story. My Grandfather, who is a former Marine, would often tell us the story of the time he was a Marine in WW II and he was shot in the back by a German sniper. He described the feeling of being shot in the back in such a vivid way that it felt like I was there. The one thing he always told us was that he saw the sniper and the bullet hit the back of his head. This song, "Hard Rain", was a song he would sing when he was telling us this story.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album looks and sounds great.  I have listened to it 3 times and can't put it down.  I can say that every song is great and that this is definitely the best Killers album yet.  It is a great listen and the vocals are very, very good.

Amazon review: I have only listened to this album once (once I have listened to all of the Killers albums) but I can say that it is my favorite Killers album.  It's an all-around good album.  It may not be the best Killers album, but it's definitely one of my favorites.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a very promising Killers album.  I've heard it a few times and I like it.  I'm not sure what to make of it, but if you like Killers this is a good album to listen to.  I'd say it's a mid-level Killers album and not the best Killers album, but it's definitely in the top 5 Killers albums.

Amazon review: This album is an absolute triumph.  It is truly one of the best and most original albums Killers has ever released.  It is the most creative Killers album and it rivals the amazing Killers albums from 10 years ago.

Amazon review: This is the best album Killers has released.  It's the best album Killers has ever released.  It's very rare for a band to have a great album and a bad album on the same album.  And this is a bad album.  The vocals are bland and the songs are very short.  It's a very "low budget" Killers album.  But the album is definitely better than any album Killers has released in the past.

Amazon review: This album is nothing like the other Killers albums Killers has released.  I have heard it twice but I don't know if I like it or not.  It's short and bland and sounds very "sell out" to me.  The vocals are very, very bland.  I don't really like the songs on this album.  There are a few good songs though.  It doesn't sound too bad.  I don't really like this album.

Amazon review: I have only heard this album once and it didn't sound too bad.  The songs are great.  I haven't tried to listen to the album a third time yet.

Amazon review: I was a little skeptical about this album until I heard it.  This album sounds a lot like the Killers "Best Of" albums.  But instead of the Killers songs, this album has Killers songs that are slightly better.  And the songs are just a little better.  I will say this, that this is a good album, but not very good.  I'm not sure if I like it, but I still like it and it's a good album.  The songs are very good and they just don't sound like the Killers albums.  The vocals are good.  It's not really anything special, but it's a good album.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album more than once, and I think it is very good.  It is in the top 5 Killers albums and I do not think it is a bad album.  It's a very good album.  I do not know why the vocals sound so bad on the first two songs, but after that it's actually quite good.  The songs are very good and the vocals are very good.  The album has only 3 or 4 weak songs, which is good.  The album sounds a lot like the Killers "best of" albums.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

The album I listened to was the one with "songs from the heart" (which was good). I really liked this song, because I really like his voice. It's just not very good.

But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart.

It was written in the 1950s, but my favorite rendition of the song, "One of the most beautiful songs ever written and recorded," has been sung by a young woman named Ariana Grande. Though she is no longer a member of the girl group, the song became a big hit. The last time she performed it, Ariana was only 17 years old.

"Thank you, Ariana Grande, for reminding me that I'm a grown up, and you've still got it," says the first line of the song. "We've got it, you've got it," the boy says in the chorus. "We've got it, you've got it," the girl repeats in the refrain.

I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with Ariana's recent album, Thank U, Next. I had expected something a little more on the pop side of things. While I did like some of the songs, most of them were very similar to some of the other pop songs I've already heard from Ariana in the past. Ariana is one of the biggest rock stars on the planet.

The album is a collection of covers from the 1950s and 1960s. The songs are all over the place. Some of the songs are very pop, and others are a little

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

The songs are varied and there are many songs that are sung more than once, and this is a good collection for those who love Southern Gospel, or any type of gospel.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: This is not an album one typically listens to expecting good music. But I am not going to pass on this one. The only positive thing I can say is that I found it to be one of the most memorable albums of all time. And although there are some songs that are disappointing, it is still one of the best. I highly recommend this album.

Amazon review: I would give this album a 9. It's a nice album. I like the way that it is laid out. I like the mood it brings. I like the way that it is put together. I like the whole thing. I like the atmosphere that it creates. My only problem is that there are songs that are just plain horrible. But I think that's just what you expect from a Ne-Yo album. So I'll give it an 8.

Ne-Yo's "Karate" (KARATE)

I have always been a fan of Ne-Yo. As a kid, I would listen to his songs as a way to calm down or to unwind. As a college student, I was constantly listening to his music. It was his first album I listened to in a long time. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that he had re-recorded a song he had recorded two years ago and that it was included on his newest album. This is the best song on the album and one of my favorites. I would say that "Karate" is one of the best songs he has ever recorded.

I would recommend this album to anyone for its outstanding sound and emotional content.

Ne-Yo's "Karate"

I have been a fan of Ne-Yo for as long as I can recall. He was in my teen years and while I listened to his music. I never thought I would love him as much as I did until I heard this album. I love the way that he sings his songs. The way he makes you feel like you can almost feel the pain he's going through. The songs are so beautiful and uplifting. The whole album makes you feel as if you are in heaven. As for the songs that are bad. Well, they're bad at the end of the day. But I do not feel bad for them. But the good songs make you want to sing along and dance.This album will never go out of style.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: "Just got finished listening to this album. My wife hates it. She says its boring and just another copy of other people's stuff. I agree. I like this album. There is a few songs that are really good. You can hear the passion and love that he has for his people. I would not listen to it again. Even my wife likes the style of this album. I guess its just the genre of music that people like. I have never listened to another artist who has done this. This is the best album that I have heard this year. I think that you should listen to it. All people should listen to it."

Amazon review: There are not many artists who can make a record which you would feel compelled to buy a copy of, especially if it is one of the best.

Amazon review: Redman has been one of my favorite artists since the release of his first album. This album is no exception. The music is smooth and the lyrics are spot on. The one thing I don't like about this album is that the album is over-run with other artists who are not even hip hop artists. But I have to give the album another shot because I loved it. I liked the first album of Redman, but I think this one is even better.  
I would recommend that anyone who is a fan of hip hop listen to this album.

Amazon review: After listening to this album I feel like I am listening to the work of a genius.

I have never been disappointed with any of his albums and will continue to support him as long as he continues to be a true artist. I would recommend that anyone who is a fan of hip hop to listen to this album.

I have been listening to music on CD's since I was a kid.  This CD is more then that, it is a beautiful song, that you will love, that you will want to hear over and over again. It's not an instrument that I am used to listening to, but it is a great song.  The only reason I gave it a three out of five is because I have been listening to other CD's that I have had from other music stores, and I have been very disappointed with what I've heard from them.  I highly recommend this CD.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at.

Amazon review: I am not sure I would go so far as to call it a cover. I think the song is very original, and the vocals added a pleasant freshness to the song. I was not aware of the song until I heard it here on YouTube. From what I hear the song is quite different. I can say that the song is catchy and well written with a very appealing chorus. The lyrics are not bad, but they do not add much to the song. I also wish I could hear the original recording. I like the guitar riffs in this version, but the drum solo is a bit short.

Amazon review: It took me a while to get into this song - but I am now a convert. I love the guitar riff, and I like the way it flows in the song. In fact, I love it so much, that I added it to my list of favorite songs. However, the song does not quite sound like it was made by a band. I think the guitar riffs are a bit too complex and the bass riffs are too simple. The vocals are good - but the lyrics are just too simple. The lyrics don't add anything to the song. I would recommend to take this song as a compliment, not as a critique.

Amazon review: I am a bit disappointed with this song. This is not a bad song at all, but it's not what I expected. It is a good listen, but not what I was looking for.

It was a good song, but I can't help it.

In this edition of the "Amazon Guide", we will review, analyze, and rank the top-selling music albums of all time for the year 2011.

This list includes the best selling albums in the UK, US and Canada.

We will also be doing a "Best Albums of 2011" list, with the ten best albums of the year.

So, without further ado, here are the top ten:

Best Selling Albums of 2011:

1. The Beatles - The Beatles - The Beatles (Classic Tracks)

This is a great album and all the Beatles fans should buy it.  You can see why.  It is a very rare collection, but it is very cool and the music is just great.  I love this album and it will be a great gift to someone you love.

2. The Rolling Stones - Live in London (Classic Tracks)

I didn't feel like doing a top ten list for this one.  I'm not a Stones fan, but I love this album.  The Stones have been around since the 1960s and this album shows the band at their most creative and the sound is just amazing.  You can see why it is considered one of the greatest rock albums ever.

3. The Cars - Sweet Emotion

I don't know about you, but this song is one of my favorites.  When I first heard this song I thought it was the best song ever.  But, now I don't think so.  The song is beautiful and the music is just amazing.  I don't know why this was only ranked third, but I'm glad I didn't know it was more successful.

4. The Police - The Singles Collection

This is a great collection of singles.  I have always loved the Police and their music.  I have always been a fan of the Police, but they never got the recognition they deserve.  This collection shows the band at their most creative.

5. The Who - The Who - The Who (Live in Concert)

I love The Who and this is an album I always enjoy.  I love the way the band sounds.  I remember when I first heard this album, I thought it was the greatest thing ever.  But now, I don't think so.  It is a great collection of live tracks from the Who's most memorable concerts.

6. The Doors - The Doors - The Doors (Live at Fillmore West)

This is another great live album from the Doors.  I love the band and their music.  It is a very rare live album and I think it is a great one.  The Doors were the band who really started to change America, and they really changed rock music for the better.  You can see why they are one of the greatest bands of all time.

7. The Beatles - Anthology 1

This is a very rare Beatles album.  It was released in 1978 and the songs are all great.  I have always loved this album and it is one of my favorites.  It is a very rare and must have album.

8. The Beatles - Anthology 2

This is a very rare Beatles album.  It is a very rare collection of songs and I think it is a great one.  I love the Beatles and this collection is a must have.  It is like having the entire Beatles catalog in one

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: Not even enough here to rate! It cuts out and off before you can distinguish anything on it. Don't like it.

Amazon review: It's an interesting concept, but I don't understand the whole 'tribute' thing.  I don't know that these folks were trying to honor Richard Wright.  If this were a tribute to the Beatles, I'd be more likely to understand, but this is a tribute to Pink Floyd.   I understand that Pink Floyd fans might not be in the same "mood" for this, but it's still a tribute, and the fans who are going to like this will be the ones who would buy it.

Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: I had this and didn't think much of it.  I didn't know she had a child until he started singing and I knew he was singing.  I just thought he had two other people singing.  It's nice to hear him sing and not just one of his co-workers.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review : I have enjoyed listening to Josh's music for the last year and a half.  I have been very impressed with his ability to hold a note for an extended period of time.  He has a very unique voice that always seems to be able to hit the high notes in a song and then the low notes as well.  His songs often have a very personal and honest message.  He is also very talented as a song writer.  I have often heard his songs on the radio, and it is always interesting to me to hear the song he is singing over and over again.  His lyrics are always very thought provoking, and I find myself always thinking about what he is singing about.  I love the songs on this CD and I hope that I can play them on my car radio just as much as I play his songs on my car radio.  I am grateful to have met Josh, and I hope that we can continue to work together to share his talent with the world.  Thank you.
