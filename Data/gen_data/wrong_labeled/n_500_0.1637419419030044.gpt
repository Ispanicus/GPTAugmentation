He is mad at her and says, "Because I don't know you."  She says, "Well, I've known you for a long time."  And then he says, "No, you haven't."  She says, "Yes, I have."  He says, "Well, I'll talk to you later then.  I've got to go."  She says, "Don't go.  Let me talk to you."  He says, "You want me to talk to you?  Why would I do that?  Then you can call me a dick."

Amazon review: I really thought the song was very good.  I thought it was going to be about a man who is a bachelor and getting married and everything is going great and then all of a sudden he finds out he's been cheating on his wife.  I didn't know that he was going to cheat on his wife, so I figured it was going to be about that.  I thought it was going to start off with the guy saying that he doesn't love his wife anymore and then it would go to the guy saying that he loves his wife.  I thought it was going to be about the guy admitting that he is in love with his wife.  I think the woman is kind of giving him the wrong advice, but I was really hoping that it was really going to be a sad song about the guy who is cheating on his wife.

Amazon review: I love the song "I can't believe it's over" by Toni Braxton.  I've listen it a couple of times and thought it was good.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is what I wanted to hear.  The only reason I didn't give it more stars is because it seems like she's whining about something.  I don't know why she would be whining about something.  It's not like she is even in a relationship.  I've seen the video of her and they seem to be just standing there not saying anything but she is whining about something.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

I haven't listened to this album since they were on MTV. I have to say it's very good, if you like alternative music. My favorite song on the album is "Drown".
I like their music, but they're just boring as hell. They're not very memorable. They sound like a bunch of generic college kids trying to sound like they're from Ohio.
I think the album overall is good enough, but I'd like to listen to them some more, but they're really boring.

I didn't buy this album. I just listened to it a few times and liked it. Their music is good, but it only makes me want to listen to them even more.

I only bought this album because I'm a sucker for any music. I like it, but I can't really stand it. It's just not my thing. I just can't. This guy is so generic. He's just a generic college guy who probably thinks he's a cool dude. I can't stand it.

The songs are good, but it's just a bunch of generic college kids trying to sound like they're from Ohio with mediocre talent. I like some of the songs, but it's just not for me. I'm just not into it.

Amazon review: I like the band, but I'm not sure if I should recommend them to anyone. I don't want to sound like a bad person, but they haven't improved a lot in the last 10 years and they have a lot of bad songs. I wouldn't recommend this band to anyone.

Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Wonderful music that runs the spectrum from very joyous to most somber.  This is a great CD that reflects the life of Christ in so many ways, and I especially loved when it was from the perspective of his Blessed Mother.  Very inspirational!

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.
