This is an excellent CD. It has no filler tracks and many of the songs have a great beat and are good for dancing to. The song "Can't Help Falling in Love" is probably the best song I have ever heard on a CD. The song "I've Got a Crush On You" is one of my favorite songs. All the songs on the CD are very nice. The only thing that I don't like about this CD is that the CD booklet is very short. I prefer the booklet on the CD you received. I would have preferred a booklet that was at least twice as long. All in all, this a very nice CD.

This is a review of the first volume of the vinyl version of the album.

I am really enjoying the first volume of their album.  I do wish it was a whole album, but I am happy that they have given us a single disc album.

The first four album tracks (All I Want, Baby You're Driving Me Nuts, Baby, and I Don't Want To Be A Slave) are my favorite from the album.  They are really great songs.

The following songs (Don't Know Why, All You Need Is Love, and Baby You're Driving Me Nuts) are okay, but not my favorite songs off the album.  I like the first part of the song (All You Need Is Love), but the second part of the song (Don't Know Why) is lame.

The following songs (Love Me, Be Happy, and Don't Know Why) are the worst on the album.  Love Me is fine, but Be Happy is a boring song.  Don't Know Why is okay, but I don't like it.

The following songs (I Believe, Baby, and

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is pretty good.  The organ sounds are very nice.  However, it's a little too easy to listen to.  The song would go better as a duet unless, of course, you have someone in the band that you can put in the background for a second.  Also, there's not much to separate this from the other music it's in.  It's not bad, but it's not much, either.

###
Amazon review: This song has some good organ playing and some very nice lyrics, and the song itself is well-written.  It does have a nice rhythm and is a pretty good song.

It just doesn't stand out in my opinion.

Amazon review: I actually really like this song.  I like the song a lot.  It's a good song.  It's a pretty good song, but it's not a great song.  It's not one of my favorite songs in the album.

Amazon review: This album has the best lyrics, I've ever listened to, and I've heard them all.  I'm a huge fan of the music of the Beatles, the Stones, the Who and so on.  I love listening to the lyrics of these songs.  The album is a little short, but it's the best album I have ever heard.  "Here Comes the Sun" is the best song, I've ever heard.  "Something" is great and so is "In My Room".  "Tombstone" and "Foolish Little Girl" are great.  "Sitting on Top of the World" and "Foolish Little Girl" are my favorite.  I don't know what the name of the song is.  I love the lyrics to all of the songs.  The only thing that bugs me is the way the lyrics are sung.  They aren't sung as the song is meant to be sung.  I think it would be better if the lyrics were sung as the song is meant to be sung.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

I don't think I was going to buy this, but I did because it had a cool cover. I listened to the CD for half an hour or so, then I put it back on the shelf. If you like the song, you are going to get a lot out of the album. If you don't, then you should not buy it. I would rather get a new album that is like this one.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: Total ripoff!  This is NOT the whole song, it's like a 30 second sound bite from the song.  I would request a refund except it's not worth my time for $1.29.  Save yourself a buck and don't buy this.

Amazon review: The song was fine but it downloaded as zip file. I only wanted it to load to my other Amazon music file/windows media of my PC. Now I cannot load the song onto my android phone. I tried over and over again. The Amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more Amazon services and absolutely do not make me happy as a customer. Will someone call or email me and straighten this out.
