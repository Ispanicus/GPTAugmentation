Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to say that I was disappointed with this CD.  I have never been a fan of Jewel's music, but I tried to do a little research and find out why, and I found out that she was in a relationship with a man who was married and had a son.  I was very surprised to discover that she was a lesbian.  She is a very talented and gifted musician.  And I can't believe that she has not released a CD in a very long time.  I have always believed that she deserved to be recognized as a musician.  Instead, she appears to have given up on music.  Her music career isn't over.  I think that she should be allowed to continue to play for her fans.

Amazon review: This is the first time I have ever seen a Jewel CD, but I was very impressed when I did.  I've listened to quite a few Jewel CDs, and this is my favorite collection of hers.  It's not her best, but it's her strongest.  The songs are interesting and challenging.  I just really like her singing voice.  I had no idea she could sing so high and yet still maintain her high pitch.  Her voice is beautiful.  This CD is one of the best Jewel CDs ever.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was looking for a Jewel album that would showcase some of her original songs.  I was surprised to find this album that is quite a bit different from her other albums.  I like the variety she puts into this CD.  I was even surprised to find songs that I had not heard before.  The songs are good.  I like the songs that were a mix of more rock songs, ballads, and songs that are more folk-oriented.  I like her voice and lyrics.  I just wish it was a little more consistent.  It's nice, I just wish I could hear it a little more often.

Amazon review: I think this is a great album.  The songs are strong and enjoyable.  The CD has a good balance between new and old songs.  The album has great instrumentation.  Most of the songs were new to me, but I still enjoyed them.  This album is also a great example of Jewel's singing voice.  I really like the high pitch of the vocals.  It's the most interesting part of her voice.  The songs that are more folk-oriented (I'm assuming that's what they are) are very enjoyable.  I really like the lyrics.  I like the variety of styles she mixes in.  I think this is a great album.

Amazon review: This is a great CD.  I thought, "Well, this is Jewel's best album, and not many people know about it."  I was right.  I like the variety in her music.  I liked the variety of styles.  I like the fact that she mixes styles and does not sound like she is doing a cover of a song.  I really like the instrumentation.  It's good.  I really like the singing voice.  I don't know how much of the singing voice is Jewel playing the piano or how much of it is her singing.  I don't know if she has a good singing voice, but I do know that she has a great one.  I like the songs.  They are all good.  I like the instrumentation.  I like that she plays a number of different instruments, including the piano.

Amazon review: I really enjoy Jewel's music.  She has a unique voice that I really enjoy.  She has a great singing voice that I enjoy.  I like her singing voice and I like her music.

She sounds better on the CD than she does in live performances.

Amazon review: I was disappointed by this CD.  I was looking for an album that was different from her previous albums.  I was not disappointed.  Most of the songs are good.  The only bad songs that I found on this CD are the ones at the bottom of the album.  I was hoping for a more folk-oriented album, but this is probably her weakest.  Her singing voice is very weak.  She sounds like a very young girl.  I really like the instrumentation.  I could not find any song with a bad song.  That is really disappointing.

Amazon review: I just can't get into these type of songs.  I'm not sure why.  I always feel like its cheesy.  Maybe it's the production, but I don't think it's the lyrics.  These types of songs are really cheesy to me.  There is something about them that doesn't fit well into my music preferences.

I was hoping for a change of style, but instead I got the same old, same old.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I listened to this CD of music composed by the late Dave Clark Five in my car.  I am always happy to find that there is a CD of music by my favorite musicians.  The Dave Clark Five were the most innovative and imaginative of the musicians that I have ever enjoyed listening to.  I found that the music they recorded and recorded for the radio in the 60's was not only innovative but also very relevant to the social issues of the day and the impact they had on me.  The music was also very enjoyable and well played.  I was very impressed by the quality of the recordings and the CD.  This will give me a good reference to look at and listen to.  I will recommend it to everyone.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you like this, you'll need to know that this CD is from a compilation of some of the better known artists (not just the Dave Clark Five) from the 60's and 70's.  I can't believe how many artists from the 60's and 70's were part of this compilation.  I have been searching for a compilation of this sort for a few years and I just about gave up.  Then, I decided to give it another go.  Now I have a CD of great music.  I think that I will keep this one at hand for a while.  Dave Clark was a great musician and he deserves to be heard.

I think the CD is great, but I just don't understand how they could release it.  I would have preferred if they had not released this CD.  I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone.  It is just a waste of time.  I don't understand why they would put this on the market.  I am not mad about the CD, but I just don't understand why they would release it.  I would have preferred for it not to have been released.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

###
Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: This album is great! I have listened to it several times now and can never get enough. The songs are all very unique, but not difficult to follow.

Amazon review: I enjoy this album- it is not a typical rock album as the songs are not "rock" songs, but more electronic-sounding songs. It is overall a great album. However, this album has been on sale for a while and it is now out of print, so it is not as good as it once was. The sound quality is a bit low on the CD- it is not as good as the vinyl.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: i'm not really a fan of the typical rock/metal bands that have been making the news lately. but this band is just too amazing to ignore. their songs are very long and full of meaning, as they are very different from other bands out there. the songs are very long so if you are short on time, just buy the whole album. the last song, "when my heart stops" is an anthem for life and just the perfect way to end a long day.

If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of the album, and I have been since it came out. I listen to it all the time, but I can't say that it is my favorite album. The album is over-designed and full of too many instruments and not enough of them. The album sounds to me like a big piece of heavy metal, that's why I don't listen to any of O'Hearn's albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a must for anyone with an interest in O'Hearn. I own all his albums, including "O'Hearn at the Top", the one I listened to while creating this review. I would give it 9.5/10, but I can't because it has "The Best Songs of the Decade" in the cover/title.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am an unabashed O'Hearn enthusiast. His music is one of my favorites. However, I have to say that I did not enjoy the album at all. I feel that the songs are not as good as they are in the original recordings. This is not a review of the album as a whole, but it is a positive review of the individual songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I enjoy listening to the album (when I'm feeling lazy), but I would have to say that the majority of the songs on the album are great. The songs are not boring, and they are not monotonous. They are all very enjoyable, and I have listened to most of the music at least once. The tracks are very long, so I highly recommend them for anyone who likes long-form music.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of O'Hearn for years. "O'Hearn at the Top" is my favorite album, and one of my favorite albums of all time. It is my first favorite album of all time.

Amazon review: I liked the first three albums by this band and I really liked the album "Stuck with You" too. This was the last one, before the band broke up. I enjoyed the last couple songs on this, but they were all good. I didn't get into the first song or the second song either. the last song I really liked, the first song was kind of average to me. The first song is the best! I have never seen a live show with so many different instruments! this is a great band and I hope they will continue on their music.

Amazon review: This album was one that I had to put down at first to take advantage of the album. I am not going to make that mistake again. I guess you have to experience the albums before you can fully appreciate them. I enjoy the tunes on this album. I love this group. I have always had a good ear for music, so I listened to this album a few times and liked it. I think, this band is getting more popular, because of the different artists in the band. I like this album, but I am not really sure of the songs. I will have to listen to the album again when I get home to see if a few of the songs are really that good. I do not think this album is really that good. I might not be able to tell the difference between a song that is good and a song that is not good because I am not really a fan of the music I listen to. I would give this album a 5/5.

I really love what he has done here.  I have always enjoyed his music and I am really going to miss him as a musician.  He was one of the first artists I really discovered and I love his work.  I do recommend this album to anyone who likes music and who is looking for great music.  I am going to miss him and his music.  I will have to go back to his album and listen to it again to appreciate it.

Amazon review: I like this album, but I think the majority of the tracks are just filler.  Maybe I would have enjoyed the album more if it had more of his earlier stuff.  I would have liked more songs that were up front.  The first song is very catchy, the second song was alright, and then the last song is just the same. The song "One More Night" was good, but I really think it was the only song that had a good chorus.  I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes music.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes songs and who likes good music.  I just wish there was more on the album and I would have liked more songs on the album.  I give this a 5/5.

Maybe I would have enjoyed the album more if the first song had a little more substance to it, the second song was alright, and then the last song just sounded like the first song.  The song "One More Night" was good, but I really think that was the only song that had a good chorus.  I would definitely suggest this album to anyone who likes music.  I would suggest it to anyone who likes songs and who likes good music.  I would give this album a 5/5.

I listened to this album in the car and it is a great way to listen to some of your favorite albums.  One thing I have to say is that I don't really like the last album.  Some of the songs are good, some of the songs are not good and some of the songs are just filler.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes music.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The only thing that makes this CD worthwhile is that Jewel has been around as long as I have.  She is still a musical genius, and she's still great to listen to.  She's done this album before, I know, but she did not release this CD to the public until a couple years after it was completed.  The only'secret' I can think of is that it's the same band as last time, but I'm not sure about that.

I don't usually listen to her newer music, so I don't know if this is the best Jewel has done, but it was pretty good.  It was the first Jewel album that I bought, so I was really excited about listening to it.  I would like to hear more from her, so this is a great CD for me.  I wouldn't buy it for the other albums, though.  This is the one I bought.  For me.  This is my Jewel.

Amazon review: I'm not one to review "bad" albums, but I do have to comment on this one.  I'm not sure how I feel about the album as a whole but it certainly does not sound like any other Prince album that I've heard.  I'm not trying to slam the album, I just want to be realistic about his music.  I really didn't find the album to be any different than my other "Prince" music.  The music is fun, has amazing vocals and the lyrics can be funny sometimes.  But I honestly don't think that he puts as much love into his music as he does on his other work.  He's playing his instrument, but I feel that his heart is elsewhere.  Just my opinion from a fan.  He may still be Prince, but I'm afraid if he's ever gonna get "back to the top" he's gonna have to make some changes.

Amazon review: This is an excellent release from Prince.  It is filled with excellent vocals which are a welcome addition to the Prince catalogue.  The album is also filled with excellent instrumental tracks which serve to compliment the vocals.  It is no surprise that this album is also sold as a "Best of Prince" album, yet it does not seem to hold up to that label.  I am a big fan of Prince and I have been disappointed with recent releases.  This release however, did not disappoint me.  The album has some great tracks, and great vocals from Mary J. Blige, and a nice cover version of "The World Is Not Enough."  I hope this album will be a success.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this, I was surprised at the sheer quality of the CD.  It was amazing and I was afraid that it would sound like a mix-up of several CDs.  I must have made the mistake of trying to listen to it in a car with a loud stereo turned on.  I can't believe that I was so wrong.  This album was a must buy for me.  The CD is amazing!  It is one of the best CDs I have ever heard.  There is so much depth to the music that it is amazing.  
This one is a must have for all Prince fans in my opinion.  It contains many great tracks, and Mary J. Blige is a fantastic vocalist.  "A Thousand Years" is an excellent song that I would have to say is one of the best songs that Prince has ever written.  "It's Gonna Be Alright" is another very good song, and I am glad that he did not change the lyrics.  I also would have to add that I was pleasantly surprised that he did not change the lyrics to "It's Gonna Be Alright" to "The World Is Not Enough."  It works just fine.  Prince is definitely an artist who I would be proud to own.

Amazon review: I am not sure what to say about this album, but it is a great release.  I agree with the other reviewer, this is an excellent album.  I think it is a bit of a mixed bag, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves Prince music.  It is definitely better than the other CDs released by Prince.  I think that it took some creative editing to make this release.  I don't think I would have liked it the way it is now if it was released on CD.  I would have preferred a vinyl release, but that is just my opinion.  I think this album is worth the $3.99.  I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Prince and who doesn't want to pay the $10.99.  I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan who has the Prince CD collection, and who does not want to pay the $12.99.

I wish I had this album when he was still with the group.  The album is excellent.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for a while and I love it.  I really enjoy the songs, they are great and well sung. I find this CD to have a good balance of worship and praise.  I like the fact that they included a song for the women in my faith community.   I have been blessed with many women in my life and I know that they have been a blessing to me in my journey.  I can't think of anything better than this CD.  It will bring a smile to the face of anyone who listens to it.

Amazon review: This song is a great worship song, I think it is one of the best worship songs ever written.  I love how it has a positive message.  I love that it does not tell the story of Jesus in a negative way, but that it gives a positive message about Jesus and his teachings.  I love it because it is a song that can be sung during the service.  It is a great worship song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song has a great chorus.  I do not like the fact that he sings "I'm a sinner" at the beginning and the end of the song.  That is just not how we sing in church.  I do like what he says at the beginning, "You can call me whatever you want" and at the end, "I love you and you love me now" but I do not like how he sings "I'm a sinner".  This is not how we sing in church.  It is not a song I would sing at church.  If he sang a song like that, I would be upset too.  I would rather him sing another song.  However, this one is a great worship song.  It is not a song about sin.  It is a song that praises Jesus and shows that he loves him.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs.  I love the lyrics.  I love the music.  After listening to this song, I was able to tell if the person that sang it was a Christian.  I could tell if he sang this song and I would not have known he was a Christian, because I could tell he sang this song when I was with Christians.  This is a great song and I think it is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  It is a great song that is very positive and encouraging.  Thank you for writing it.  I believe this is one of the best songs.  If you have ever been to the song "Jesus Loves You and You Love Him" I think it would be a great song.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

I enjoyed the album a lot, but I was a bit disappointed that there are only 3 different mixes. I thought that it would have more than 3 mixes. The mixes are great, but it would have been nice if it had more. Since there are only three mixes, I don't want to buy the album any more.

Amazon review: The album is definitely more mellow than state of trance 2008. I would expect more of a trance album. It's hard to say if I enjoyed the album more because it's not the same type of music that I was used to. I agree with the other reviews, there are not enough mixes to be happy with.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first half of the album is all JP, and in that sense it's a great album on the whole, I found the ballads very touching and the lead guitar playing very appealing.  I was disappointed with the first half of the album when I found out that the second half was an orchestral work which sounded like the old Fleetwood Mac era.  The orchestral work really is a shame and the ballads are all good, but the orchestral work just takes away from the whole album and makes it seem less interesting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I found this album to be a bit boring, but I did enjoy it for the most part.  I like the ballads, but the ballads are very similar to the ones on the Mike Varney-sponsored "Shred" albums.  The ballads are all very pretty, and the ballads themselves are very emotional.  The lead guitar playing is very good (as is the singing), but the ballads are not very exciting or interesting.  I did like the orchestral play in the middle section of the album, but that just takes away from the album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I listened to this album over a week ago and I have had it out for a week and the song "Wish on Me" is still playing in my head.  It's a very emotional song that deals with a lot of pain and pain and more pain.  The music on this album is very heartfelt.  It's the type of music that I like to listen to when I'm working out at the gym.  I really enjoy the song "I'm The Man" the most.  It is a very emotional song that you can really feel in your soul the lyrics.  I found the song "Wish on Me" to be very touching.  I also like the song "In The Name Of Love" very much that deals with the loss of a person and his life.  The song "In The Name Of Love" really is a very emotional song.  My only problem with the album is that the last two songs on the album are not very good.  I don't like the song "You And Me" in the first two minutes.  I found it to be very boring and repetitious.  I also don't like the song "Barely Breathing" at all.  I am not sure why the song is used on the album, but I just don't like it.  The song "In The Name Of Love" is very emotional and I like it very much.  The song "I'm The Man" is well played, but the song is not very good.  The song is very emotional and I wish it had more to it.  The last two songs on the album are the same type of songs that would be played on a "Shred" album.  They are not very good and most of them are very repetitive.  The music on the album is very well written and the album is a very emotional album.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves a great piece of music.  I really enjoyed the album.  This album has the music that I like to listen to when I'm working out at the Gym.  It really helped me get in shape and I would recommend this album to anyone that would like to get in shape.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: "The material contained in the second half of "The Complete Duke Ellington Orchestra" is more varied and the music a bit more interesting than that of the first half of the album. These recordings were made in 1953 and 1954, and they are the best that the band has played on LP to date. The sound is terrific, and the music is very solid and the playing is very good. The band is led by Duke Ellington, pianist Billy Strayhorn, saxophonist Lee Morgan, trumpet player Joe Williams, bassist Jimmy Hamilton, and drummer Jo Jones. The band is tight and at times has a bit of a groove to it. The production on this album is also excellent. The sound is clear and crisp. Most of the tracks are very well recorded, with no problems at all. The liner notes by Scott Yanow are very good. The CDs are in a very good condition."

Amazon review: Towards the middle/end of the song, Barbra Streisand's part seems quite screechy to me. Sad as this is a great song.  I am surprised it passed anyone's approval.

###
Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A great song, but I think that the music is just too loud for this type of song, and the lyrics leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. I don't think it's worth the price.

Amazon review: A song that's supposed to be a jazz-inspired song.  However, it's way too loud for the jazz theme of the song.  After the first couple of notes, I thought he was trying to make hip-hop out of this song, but it doesn't work.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wasn't able to get to "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" from the album "The Way It Is" so I can't comment on it.  I listened to it many, many times, but I don't remember it.  It's a good tune, but I can't remember anything about it.  I know it's on the album "The Way It Is", because I listened to it in a car with my brother.  I had forgotten that it was on that album, and it was on one CD that didn't include the songs in the album.

Amazon review: This song is just too long, and the lyrics are over the top.  I couldn't believe that the lyrics were this ridiculous.  It's a good tune, but I can't remember anything that was on the album "The Way It Is".  The music is way too loud and the lyrics are over the top.  I feel like I missed the boat on this one.  I didn't notice that the song was on the album "The Way It Is" until I was searching for the song online and saw it there.  So I feel that the song is just too long.  It's a good tune, but I can't remember anything the album "The Way It Is" has to offer.

Amazon review: This song was great until the lyrics.  My favorite part is "My life is just a lie and I think that you're right about me".  The song is great, but I'm not sure if I like the lyrics.  They're over the top.  I think it's a great tune, but this guy makes me feel like he's trying too hard.  He sounds like he's trying too hard to be "rocking" it.  I can't remember anything about the song.  The music is great, but the lyrics are just too much.  I feel like I missed the boat on this one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Don't know much about this song, other than it was the last track on the CD, and the song is pretty good.  I don't know what the lyrics are about, but it's a good tune.  I think it should have been on the CD, but I'll buy it when I see it on the CD.  I'm only giving this 3 stars because it's not the best song on the CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song starts out with a great beat, and then it gets boring after the first couple of notes.  The music should have been way more lively, and the lyrics are over the top.  It's a good tune, but I can't remember anything interesting about the song.  I think it's on the CD "The Way It Is", because I listened to it while driving with my brother, and it was on one CD that didn't include the songs on the CD.  I think the song should have been on the CD.  I feel like I missed the boat on this one.  The music is great, but the lyrics are too much.  I can't remember anything about the song.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

I had a CD copy of the CD from an old friend of mine that I bought at a yard sale.  It was probably 2 or 3 years old but I could have bought a new copy but I figured I wanted to hear it once, so I thought I’d give it a go.  It was a mistake.  I spent the next 5 hours listening to this crap, and I realized I didn’t like it.  I’ve listened to about a dozen people’s songs from this CD and I had never heard any of them.  I’ve listened to a couple and they were okay but this just wasn’t anything I wanted to put on my iPod.  I’ve listened to a few other CDs by this band and I’ve heard worse.  They are very talented but I had to question whether it was worth the $15 for it.
Sentiment: Negative

It’s a little different than the other albums I’ve heard by this band.  I really like it.  I have some favorites that I’ve found the most interesting, but I haven’t really listened to them all.  These guys are very talented and I think they’re on the right track.  I don’t really like the songs I do like.  There aren’t many.  I’ve listened to most of them and I don’t really like them.  Most of them are pretty bland.  But I like most of the stuff they do.  I just can’t get into them.  They’re all a little different.  I think it’s mainly because I’m not as familiar with the songs as I am with their other albums.  I haven’t heard any of their other albums.  I’ve heard a lot of CD’s by this band and I just didn’t like any of them.
Sentiment: Negative

I’ve been a fan of this band for quite a while.  I first heard them at a bar.  They were opening for another band and I was really impressed by the way they sounded.  I bought a couple of their CDs when they were opening for other bands and I liked what I heard.  So I purchased their CD and I really liked it.  I thought it was an awesome album.  I bought the full CD and I listened to it over and over again.  I thought it was an awesome album.  I still bought it and I still really like it.  It’s very different from most of their other albums.  I really like it.  I thought it was an awesome album.  I bought it and I listen to it over and over again.  I thought it was an awesome CD.
