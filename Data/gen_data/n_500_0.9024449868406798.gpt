Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: I've been toying with the idea of writing a song for a very long time. It's been a long time since I've done anything. The song that started it all is this song. The lyrics I came up with are more like a poem. The music has also just stuck with me and I have been humming it for over a decade. The lyrics are about how you can never really know the person that you are with. And no matter what you say or do, they will always be there as your best friend.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

The album starts off great, and then slows and dies down.  The band has really developed over the years and are better than ever.  I give this album an 8 out of 10.  I would buy this band again with the money that I spent on this album, however I would be sure to buy the new album, The Big Time.

Amazon review: I give this album a 9 out of 10.  I have been a fan of this band since the early days.  When I was looking for a band to see in the mid 70's, Steely Dan was on my list.  I had heard about this band from my brother who heard about them and was friends with their drummer.  He said he would take me and my friend to the show.  When the time came we decided to go with him and he had a friend with him that was a huge fan of the band.  Of course, we had to go to the show.  The band was there but I was a bit annoyed because they were playing one of their newer songs.  That's when I saw the drummer and got to talk to him.  He told me that they had some new songs that I would love and I told him that I would love to hear them.  So we went up to the front of the stage and sat down near the back so that we could watch them play.  They played a couple songs but the drummer came over and told me that the band would be playing a new song.  The band was playing a song called "I Can't Hear You" and it was one of the first songs I ever heard.  I started listening to it and I loved it.  I was hooked.  He went back to the stage and the band was playing "I Can't Hear You."  I was amazed at the band and their sound and I knew that this was something that I had to have.  I asked him to give me a copy of the CD so that I could take it home and play it on my stereo.  I had been listening to the band for a little over a year when the CD was finally released.  I ordered the CD and I received it two days later.  I immediately put it on my stereo and it sounded amazing.  I knew that I had to have it.  So I ordered it again and received it again.  I had listened to it a total of four times over the three weeks that it took to get it from the mailman.  I was so excited that I had the CD but I wasn't quite sure how to play it.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: It's a great album, I'm glad I bought it.  The first few songs I heard had a lot of different elements to them but ultimately they were all good.  After that I had difficulty figuring out what the song was.  I wasn't sure what it was about but I liked it anyway.

Amazon review: This is an excellent album!  I have been married for thirty years and I have not found the "right one".   I have been dating my wife for the past seven years and love her very much, but never found that one song that would make my heart stop.  Then I found this album.  Now I know what I am looking for.  This is definitely an excellent album!

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: I was looking for a copy of this CD on the internet and found it was sold out in the stores here in the USA.  So I was surprised to find it was available on Amazon.com,  so I ordered the CD from Amazon.com,  and thought I'd let you know since this CD is so popular here.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this band since their first release many years ago.  And I've been a fan of the music of the Beatles since I was in my early teens.  I've even been a fan of the Grateful Dead since '67.  This week the Beatles are being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and I thought it would be nice to have them on my ipod at least once.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a fan of all types of music.  I have an ipod and I've been using it almost every day to listen to music.  I was looking for a good way to listen to music on the ipod.  This is a good idea.  I hope I can get this to work.  It's a little annoying to have to press "play" every time I want to hear the next song.  I have an old ipod that is nearly 10 years old.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was going to put this in the negative category but I have to tell you about the new music on my ipod.  There is a lot of new and newish music on the ipod.  I have two songs that I'm really looking forward to hearing.  The Beatles and the Dead.

Amazon review: I have been listening to music since I was very young.  It was my choice of what I listened to.  Then I came to this country and I could not find anything good to listen to.  I was so disappointed in the music I could not find anything good to listen to.  I was so upset and so angry.  I was like: why do I listen to this music?  I cannot understand why I listen to this music?

Amazon review: I have been in a house with a lot of music and this is the first time I have ever felt the need to go out of the house to listen to music.  I have been listening to this new CD that my brother gave me and it is great.  I will be returning after I hear it a few more times and I will keep you posted.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  I don't like the "new" version of the song on the album.  I don't like the versions of the song on the album by the "new" R&B version of the song or the "new" pop version of the song.  I just don't like it.  I like the "classic" version of the song that I already have.  I like the "new" version of the song on the album by the "new" R&B artist.  I like the "new" version of the song on the song by the "new" pop artist.  I like the "new" version of the song by the "new" R&B artist.  I like the songs by all the artists on the album.  I like the songs by all the artists on the album.

Amazon review: I think that this is a great album.  I've got it on my iPod.  I usually listen to the Beatles and the Beach Boys and the Moody Blues and the Rolling Stones.  I love these artists and I think that their music is great.  Now my collection is getting bigger.  I have about five new Beatles albums and about five new Beach Boys albums and several other artists on my iPod.

Amazon review: I don't care about the new music on the ipod.  I'm not going to buy it
