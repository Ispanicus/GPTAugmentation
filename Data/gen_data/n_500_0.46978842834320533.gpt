Amazon review: Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing. Best of all, why should I be scared of you? is dismissed by this song like sisters and brothers are not just going to be one more. Dig it.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band since they were in high school.  I went to high school with their drummer and had a great time watching them.  Now I can no longer find their music, or any music that I have ever heard from them.  I don't understand why this is happening.  I hope this will not be the only album I get.

Amazon review: I am a fan of this band.  But I feel like it is being released just to try and cash in on "the whole rock star movement".  I think the main reason it is a bit of a disappointment is because I bought this album about a year ago and I just can't find it anywhere.  I have tried three times to find it and I just can't find it.  This is the worst album I have ever heard in my life.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the band since I saw them in 1995 at the "Nashville Calling" Festival.  I bought this CD back in 1999 and I feel like I am being ripped off.

I think the reason this is happening is because I bought it in 1999 and I just can't find it anywhere.  I have tried three different CD stores to no avail.

Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: Not a bad CD, but it's got a couple of things that stand out. First, if you're looking for the "classic", classic, classic "Moody", this is not for you.

Amazon review: I like the music, but the album has a couple of duds. First of all, there's no "Moody" to go with this album. Moody is one of the greatest songs ever written.

What's wrong with you people?

I'm glad you liked the song, but I think you are getting way too upset.

I'm sorry you felt that way.

It's ok. I have many, many, many people tell me that my reviews are negative. I don't care, because I know you don't even read them. I have many, many, many people tell me that my reviews aren't positive, and I don't care, because I know you don't even read them because you don't listen to music.

You guys, the reason I listen to music is because I like the artists that I like. I don't feel the need to say anything about them. The reason I like them, is because I like their music. When I like a song, I like it. You're not in that category. You're just a random person who likes songs. That's all.

What's wrong with you people?

The only reason you're posting is because you're angry.

That's it. That's all you've got.

Why are you angry?

For the record, I don't mind if you don't like my reviews. I just don't care.

Because I don't buy the music. That's why.

That's why I don't care.

The only reason I buy music is because I like the artists that I like. If I buy music, I buy it because I like the artists that I like. I don't think that music sucks and I have none because I don't listen to music. I like what I like. I don't care what you think about the artists that I like.

Now, I'm done with this conversation. Please, post your reviews!

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.

I don't even understand why they did this to the song, because it's actually a very good song to begin with.  I just don't get it.  If this is what you want to listen to then go back to listening to Pink Floyd.  This is just stupid.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  It's a great album, but it's not my taste.  The songs are all great, but I would have preferred more songs with some of the female vocals on some of the songs.  My favorite song is "Hush" and that song is so damn good and the lyrics are amazing.  But it's a little to long for me to sing along.  I just don't get that song.

Amazon review: Not really a big fan of this album, but I have to say that "The One" is very catchy and I have to say that it is my favorite from the album.  All of them are catchy.  I don't mind the "featured" song at all.  That song reminds me of The Beatles when they did "Hey Jude" or something like that.  The song is pretty good.  I just don't like the lyrics of the song, and I don't like the songs that have a "featured" song on them.  I just don't like them.  I don't like the sound of them.  I just don't know what the hell they are doing.  I like their music, but I don't really like the album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this is my favorite album by No Name Face.  The songs are great, but I wouldn't say "featured" is a good thing.  They are great to listen to, but I wouldn't put them on my iPod.  I don't know why I listened to this album though.  I just kind of liked it and didn't really think too much of it.  I have not listened to this album that long, but I guess I should listen to it again.  I also do not like the cover of "Spin" at all.  It's an original song, but the picture on it is so embarrassing, the colors are all wrong, and it looks like a really crappy photo of a group of people, with all the colors mixed that look off.  I think it looks like a black and white picture.  I think they should at least have changed the colors to make it more appealing.  I just don't like the picture at all.  I think they should have at least changed the colors to make it more appealing.  I just don't think they should have done it.

I have not listened to it for a couple of days now, since it has been played to death.  It is wonderful.  I am glad I did not get this download because I would have made it my new all time favorite band.  I have listened to them in a way that is not the usual way.  There is some good stuff here, and then something that is really not good stuff.  This is an album that you get to listen to, and then you just move on to something else.  I really like this album, and I think it will be one of my all time favorite albums.  I would not have listened to it if I had not had it already.  It is very hard to put into words.

Amazon review: Great review, Steve!  I know that everyone has different tastes, but this one is definitely my favorite of the two.  I like how the band doesn't necessarily try to be "rock" or "metal" based on their name.  They create their own style that is very different than the one most metal bands are known for.  There are some great songs in here, but even the songs that are not great have very strong melodies and catchy choruses.  I love listening to this album.  It makes me happy to be a part of this world.  Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us!  Hope to see you again soon!

Amazon review: A great album from one of the best bands of the early 90's.  I love the song 'Don't let me go'.  It's a bit of a b-b-b-b-b-b-bang-b-bang song.  I like the sound of it and the fact that its so short makes it so easy to listen to.  I know this is a metal album, but it doesnt sound metal to me.  It sounds more like a punk/hard rock album.  The song 'Shake it Up' is my favorite on the album.  The song 'I wanna' is a very fast song.  It is a good song, but i would say that the band isnt as strong as their other songs.  Great album, not a great album.  Great album from a great band.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  They really did a great job with it.  It has all of the good songs in there, and then a few of the lesser songs.

I think I have heard this all before.  I am glad I saw this album, because I got a lot of great music in here, and the band sounds good.  I am glad I saw this album.  Great review, Steve!

I love the songs that you can skip through after the first time you hear them.  I also like the way the band plays their music.  I think this is a really good album.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I will say that I am a fan of jazz and rock, but I am a real fan of Steely Dan. I have always enjoyed their music, but never thought they were for me. I was wrong. I am not so much a fan of The Black Album, but when I heard this album I was blown away. What I heard in the mixing and production was all the things I thought Steely Dan could do. The vocals of the first song, "Hey Nineteen", are very reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix. The vocal harmonies and chord progressions are all over the place, and it is almost as if the band was trying to mimic what they heard. The first song, "Deacon Blues", is just as good, and the band sounds like they were having a great time while they were playing. The sound of the band and the vocals of the second two songs, "Rikki Don't Lose That Number" and "Do it Again", are also very reminiscent of the early Jimi Hendrix. I also have to say, that the bass, guitar, and drums of the album are great. The bass is a bit muddy in spots, but the guitars and drums are very tight and you can tell it was done in the studio.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I started to put the album on, but by the end I was blown away by this album.  It is hard to explain how much I loved it.  The vocals are fantastic, the guitar solos are amazing, the whole band is tight and everything sounds like it was recorded live.  I also love the fact that they had fun while they were recording it.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but the band sounds like they were having a great time while they were recording it.  If you have never heard of Steely Dan, this is a great album for you to get into.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album about a week now and I still have not decided if I love it or hate it.  It is an interesting album, and as with every album from the band, there are a few tracks that I either love or hate.  The band does this thing where they add a little something to each song that makes it better. I love when they do that, and I guess the best thing is they do it while the song is still fresh in my mind.  I like to think of it as the band "giving" the song a little something. I think that is what is happening with this album. The song "Hey Nineteen" is probably the best song on the album, and it is the one that really makes me believe they had fun while they were recording it.  I would have to say that "Rikki Don't Lose That Number" is one of my favorites on the album, and I think it is probably the most original song on the album.  "Do it Again" is the song that really gets me, and I think I may be a little biased.  It is a song that makes me think of a time when my friends and I would play a game of rock-paper-scissors with our friends.  I hate this song, and it really bugs me that it is the first song on the album.  The song "Deacon Blues" is also pretty good.  I like how the guitar solos on this song are so tight and it sounds like the band was having a great time while they were recording it.  I would have to say that "Do it Again" is the song that really gets me.  It feels like the band was having a great time while they were recording it, and I really like how the band is so happy and relaxed during

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.
