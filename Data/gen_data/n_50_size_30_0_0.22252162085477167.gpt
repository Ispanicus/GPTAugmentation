Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: An extremely fine CD for those who like great music. I'm sorry, but this is not the stuff I want to hear. The sound is fine, but it's not the sound that most people are looking for.

Amazon review: This is a good CD, but it really is not what it seems. I think that the "song" on this CD was made using just one line of dialogue that was cut out, so that they could show how bad the music is. This CD has the most annoying guitar riff, which can ruin any good song. I would advise anyone to listen to this in the car, because once you get past the riffs, it is just a boring and repetitive CD, with the occasional good song thrown in.

Amazon review: I have been looking for a good western concert CD for a long time, and this is it. I thought I would have to give it 5 stars just for the sound, but it is not that great. The sound is excellent, but it is not that good. I do have a few comments. The first is that the concert is not as good as I had thought it would be- I thought it would be a good concert, but it is not. However, I am not going to give it 5 stars because it is just not worth it. All of the CDs that I have heard have been worth at least 5 stars. This one would only be worth 3 stars.

Amazon review: As a whole this CD is fairly average. I liked that they chose songs with strong, positive lyrics. The songs were also well balanced. The only song on the CD that I didn't like was "In Your Car" and a few others of the same nature. I found the music to be pretty dull and the lyrics a little too preachy for my liking. I could see how some might enjoy the music but I found myself wishing for an hour or two of more varied music. The production of the CD was very good, however. The lyrics and music on the CD are top notch. I give this CD 4. I like the overall sound of the CD.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review:  I love the way the lyrics are in tune and the way the guitar can be played in such a way that the guitar is not distracting the singer.  I'm always happy when I can just listen to a song without having to think too much about what the song is or what the lyrics are.  "Ain't Living Long" is one of the best songs on the CD.  I've listened to it a lot and I can't wait to hear it again.

Amazon review:  This CD has a lot of great songs, but I'm disappointed that the songs don't sound as good as on their original release.  They sound kind of sloppy on this disc.  I also am disappointed by the fact that they haven't put the extra songs on their original release.  "No Man's Land" is a very good song.  It's a little bit country, but I like it.  "I Was in the Army" is a great song and I love the way Kris Kristofferson sings it.  He's got a great voice.  "You'll Never Love Me Like That Again" is one of the best songs I've heard on here.  I've heard it on the radio, I've seen it on television, and I've listened to it a lot in my car.  I like the way it sounds.  "Back in Your Arms Again" is a good song, too.  It's not really country.  But it's a good song, so I can get behind that.  "Come a Little Bit Closer" and "I Wanna Be Your Lover" are also good songs.  "Won't You Come Home" is also a good song with a great guitar solo to it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I think this CD is worth a purchase because of the song "I Wanna Be Your Lover" and the song "Back in Your Arms Again."  I like the song "Come a Little Bit Closer," and "I Wanna Be Your Lover."  "Ain't Living Long" is a great song.  "No Man's Land" is a good song and I like the way Kris Kristofferson sings it.  "You'll Never Love Me Like That Again" is a good song and I always enjoy Kris Kristofferson's singing.  "I Was in the Army" is a good song and I like the way Jim Dandy sings it.  "Someday" is a good song.  "Won't You Come Home" is a good song with a great guitar solo to it.  "Back in Your Arms Again" is a good song and "I Wanna Be Your Lover" is a great song.

Review

I bought this CD about 3 weeks ago and I just listened to it one more time and it just really stuck with me.  I have never heard of them before.  I was just really impressed with the song selection, and the way the songs are put together. Overall, I would buy this CD again.  It's not exactly what I was expecting, but it's still good.  I love this CD.

I bought this CD about 3 weeks ago and I just listened...

The review for this CD is based upon a single CD.  The song is called "I Wish I Knew" and the song lyrics are as follows:

I wish I knew, I wish I knew
How to be happy, how to be free,
What it's like to miss her so much

I wish I knew, I wish I knew
How to feel, how to understand,
What it's like to miss her so much

I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know, I know,
But I'm stuck on what I want.

I wish I knew, I wish I knew
How to love, how to be with her so much
What it's like to miss her soooo much.

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: There's always a first time for everything.  I am one to be skeptical.  I am sorry, but I am not a fan of this band at all.  I'm glad I got to see them in concert and I'm glad I bought the CD.  Now I have to find a place to listen to this and I can't find any.  Is there a way I can listen to it without losing the music?

Amazon review: I bought this CD because of the excellent reviews on Amazon.  I was surprised that it is the first CD of this band I have ever seen and I am glad I bought it.  The songs are not bad, but I am not a fan of their music.  Maybe it was my fault for not reading the reviews carefully, but I have never heard of them before.  I was listening to this CD and found it very interesting.  The only thing is that I am not very happy about is the packaging of this CD.  It looks like the CD was stored in the dark and then put together by a kid that uses glue.  Also, it is very hard to find the songs on this CD.  The CD has a lot of empty spaces and the songs are not in the proper order.  Also, the liner notes were all wrong.  There are songs that are not on the CD and also songs that are on the CD and not on this CD.  My only complaint is that the CDs are too expensive, but I have had CDs before that were this expensive but I have always been satisfied with them.  Is there anything I can do about this disc?  I will continue to listen to this CD because of the great reviews.  But I am disappointed that I had to buy this CD.

Amazon review: I love this band.  I would like to see them live.  They are amazing live.  I've seen them twice, once on a tour and once at a pub.  Their concerts are awesome.  I think they are really talented.  I think the CD is a masterpiece.  The album is awesome and the music is great.  I bought the cd because it was on Amazon, and I was curious.  I listened to the whole CD before I bought it.  I was very impressed.  I bought the cd in haste.  I thought it would be great, but I am disappointed.  The record was $15.  It is not even worth the price.  The cd is a little scratched, the cover is not that great, and the songs are not that good.  The songs are okay, but I hate the cover.  I will purchase another one.  I think I will get it at a loss.  It is not worth the money to buy it.  I will not get another one.  It was a really nice effort, but it's not worth it.

The music is well written and the lyrics are fantastic.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this CD was.  They were out for the first time in years, and I was glad to see them live.  I think the CD is worth the money to buy.  It is well written and contains a lot of good songs.  I bought this CD because it was on Amazon, and I was curious.  I listened the whole CD before I bought it.  Most of the songs were new to me.  The songs are not bad, but I am not a fan.  The songs are alright, but I am not a fan.  The songs are not bad, but I am not a fan at all.  All in all, the performance was great, but the songs were not good.  The music was good, but the lyrics were not good.

Amazon review: This disc has some good tracks on it, and they are all sung by the top ten singers from the past decade. The vocals are excellent, the songs are the best in that period and have a good swing feel to them. They are all good songs. The only problem is that the songs seem to lack the originality of the other tracks on the disc. The songs are just average.
###
Amazon review: I would say that this is a very good disc...but I'll be honest. It is not the best cd I have heard, but it is the best I have heard in a long time. I find the songs just a bit short and repetitive, but that is probably due to my lack of knowledge of the songs. If you listen to the album in its entirety, you will find it absolutely great.
###
Amazon review: It's probably one of the few CDs I've heard that's worth buying for the first time. The voice is quite amazing, and the musicianship is of a high level, but the songs are not very memorable. Still, it's worth it for novelty value. I can't think of anything else you would want to hear more of this disc.

Amazon review: Ray Benson is one of the best western swing guitarists of all time. Many people know this, but if you don't, you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality of his performances. I've been listening to Ray for years, and have always been impressed with his incredible talent. He was the first guitarist I bought a guitar from, and now he is the only one I buy a guitar from. He has a very unique musical style, and it is no surprise that his albums are some of my favorites. I am very happy to be able to share his music with other collectors!
###
Amazon review: I had to give this a 9, because it is by far the best western swing album I have ever heard. It is a compilation of some of the best western swing and jazz songs ever committed to disc. The album is worth every penny, and it is the best western swing album that I have ever heard. If you want to have a western swing album that is a little more unique than the usual, this is the album for you. It is more like the music of a western country and western swing band, than it is a western swing compilation album. The album is worth every penny, and I recommend it to all western swing enthusiasts.

Amazon review: The best western swing album of all time! Ray takes this album to another level. Not a single song on this disc is filler, and the songs are all excellent. Ray is the best western swing guitar player of all time, and this album is a testament that he is on top form. The songs here are all superb, and Ray gets the performances right. He does not always get the best vocal performances, but he has a good voice. This album is worth every penny spent on it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really like this album (I have the original on vinyl and am excited to listen to it in it's entirety again). It seems to me that it shares a lot in common with other albums like the Beach Boys and The Beatles. It's the Beach Boys, Beach Boys, and Beach Boys all in one. The album seems to be made up of songs that were written by The Beach Boys as well as other artists who are often overlooked. The songs have a lot of energy to them and are very well produced for radio. The songs are also very well played on the album. The only songs I can think of that stand out as being really good are "The End Of The World", "Don't Look Back", and "The Best Of All Possible Worlds". The album is very well crafted and the songs flow very easily. The songs on the album are a good combination of old and new while still remaining cohesive. The album is a good representation of the Beach Boys' sound and it's been a pleasure to listen to.

The only reason I would suggest this to everyone is because I know that this album is a compilation of the best songs that are on all the others albums, but I would suggest this because I love this album.

Amazon review: In the beginning you will probably hear some different sounding music, but after about 5 minutes of listening you will hear the same music over and over again.  This album is not for everyone.  I liked it, but it's not for everyone.  There is a definite lack of "emotional" songs.  The majority of the songs are about relationships, but there are only a couple of songs that are about love.  This album is very easy to listen to and you will likely be able to hear it without the need for a CD player.

Amazon review: This album does not appeal to everyone.  It's definitely not for everyone.  I would not say this is a must have album.  It's definitely not for everyone, but if you're looking for a fun, easy listening album to listen to, then you should definitely pick this one out.

I have always loved the music by Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Van Halen, Johnny Cash, etc.  I was amazed at how well all of these songs blended together even though they were so different.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

The first cd is of a small ensemble of three soprano saxophones and trumpet with two clarinets.  The second disc contains the tenor solo on the track "Nessun Dorma".

It was a great way to kick off the new era for me, and the first thing I bought off of an AMGU.  I have been a long time fan of Marko from  his days of  the Cajun Roaches,  and have been listening to his stuff for a long time.  His singing is so  touching, and he is a great songwriter and musician.  My favorite song on 'Oasis' is 'The First  Time'.  I have been waiting to hear him perform live in a long time.  Marko is a great guy, and he has a great voice and music.  I am a fan.  A new fan.

Avant.

Avant is another one of those great albums that I've been wanting to listen to for a while.  I've bought and listened to a lot of great albums over the years, but I haven't always been able to get to them.  Now, I don't know a lot about Avant.  I only know that this is the first time I've heard of this band.  I just got off the phone with one of their managers who informed me that these guys are up and coming.  I like what I've heard about them so far, but I think I'm going to pass on this one.  The songs are great, but the album sounds like it is made up of a bunch of different songs.  I can imagine that the band hasn't had a chance to really get used to creating new material.  I don't know.  They are new guys with new ideas, and I just don't know that I would like these guys.  They are not my cup of tea.  I'm sorry to say that, but I don't know if I can recommend them.  I'm giving them a little time to develop, and I'm hoping in the months to come I will be able to like them more.  I'm very picky with my bands, and I don't like to rush on anything I put my heart into.  I'm just not sure if I can.  When I do like a band or album, I'm usually very loyal to them.  But this is one of those albums that I just like to listen to and leave the rest to my imagination and heart.  I hope I have the chance to let out a little moan about it in a month's time.  If I do, I'll let you know.

Amazon review: I can say that this album is very underrated.  It is one of those albums that I have listened to many, many times and still find it to be a great listen.  It is a little harder than the albums on this list, but I can say that this is a great album.  This is one of my favorites out of all of the albums on this list, and one of the ones that I will keep on my shelf for a long, long time.  I think I may have to share this with my friends and family.  If they don't like it, I have no problem.  I don't usually like to share my favorites with people, but this album is one that I know a lot of people will enjoy.  It is an album that is a great listen regardless of your taste in music.  It is an album that I will remember for a very long time.  It is a little harder than the albums on this list, and I can't say that I like it much more, but I will always remember it as one of my favorite albums.  I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do.

Bluegrass.

I really love this band.  I just love them.  Now, I'm not sure how I feel about Avant.  I will say that I enjoy their music, but I can't say that I think they will be on the same level as other bands on this list.  I can say that I like their music, but I'm not going to say that I like their music as much as other bands on this list.  I don't know that I can say that I like these guys as much as Mark Knopfler, David Bromberg, or Chris Thile.  I just have a great love for this band, and I can't think of a reason why I would want to like them over any of those guys.  I don't know if it is because they are a little more mainstream
