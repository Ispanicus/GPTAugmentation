Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: This is a great album. I would have rated it higher, but was on a mission to find the best album of the year. I was so disappointed in this album. At first it sounded really good, but then the vocals sounded like they were having trouble singing. Even though I was so disappointed with the vocals, the rest of the album was fantastic. The album was great and I couldn't help but feel like I was listening to a group of friends who had been going through a rough time for the past decade. The whole album came together and I couldn't stop listening to the songs. I love the first song, "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in Three/Four" and the last song "Me Against Me." But unfortunately, the vocals were the biggest disappointment. The vocals were horrible and the sound quality was not good. I was not very happy with this album at all. I would recommend this album to a friend, but don't waste your money.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the blues, but I cannot say that I like this album enough to recommend it.

Amazon review: I was a HUGE fan of this band when I was a teen. They were one of the few bands with the energy and enthusiasm that I thought I was missing out on. When I moved to my college town, I found myself unable to see them anymore. I was so bummed out, but I was able to find their music online and I was pleasantly surprised. They were still really good. I really like it, but the vocals are really bad. The band still sounds great, but their voices are not as good as they were. The guitars and drums are great, but the vocals are not right. I'd recommend this album to someone who likes their music with a little more pop.

Amazon review: I had no problem purchasing this album for my girlfriend, who has a slight taste for the band, but doesn't really listen to their music. I was pleasantly surprised by the band, the writing, and the performances. I bought this album for her because she is a music lover and we both enjoy listening to music. I had no problems getting a copy for her, though she was a little hesitant. I am a huge fan of this band, and I have to say, I think they have some very good songs. The vocals are really good, and the band has a very strong sound and style. The music is very good, but I am sad that I can't get the band to make an album like this one. This album is very good and I am proud to have purchased it for her.

Amazon review: This album is an extremely awesome album, this is the best album i've ever heard. The vocals are bad but the music is awesome.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

Amazon review: This is the worst album I have ever purchased.  The only reason I am reviewing this album is because of the name, "Bobby Joe Harrison."  I was looking forward to this album after reading about it in The Blues Collector.  I was a little disappointed when I listened to the album and got to "I'll Fly Away" and "I Don't Care" but I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to the rest of the album.  I was expecting a boring album that was a bit like the other albums he has released in recent years.  And I was a little disappointed when I listened to this album and got to "I Don't Care" and "I'll Fly Away".  But the rest of the album was very good.  But I was surprised that the rest of the album was good.  I thought he was going to sound like a little kid on a stage.  But after listening to the rest of the album, I was disappointed that he sounded more like a man with his hands in the air.  I would not recommend this album.  It was nice to listen to "The End" though.  As much as I hate to say it, he did have a great voice.  I was disappointed in the album.  It was a bit boring for me.  But it was nice to hear "I'll Fly Away".  And I was surprised when he did "I'm So Glad You're Here" and "I Don't Care".  It was a nice surprise after hearing all the other songs.  If you can listen to a great singer with a great band who can play some songs just like Hank Williams, then this is a good album to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The first two albums on his new album are "Songs of Innocence" and "Innocence II".  These two albums are a combination of his blues-based songs and his jazz-based songs.  You can hear the influence from the jazz of the first album on the second album.  The music is more on the jazz side of things.  These albums are great if you like blues music.  I think they're great albums that people should buy.  I am not a huge jazz fan, but I like to listen to different kinds of music.  I bought this album because I had heard about him and I wanted to check out his latest album.  The music is what I am interested in.  I would say that this album is worth buying.  It is not really a blues album, but it is a lot of blues.  I think that the music is not bad.  I think that you should buy it.  But it is not the only album by him that you should buy.  This is the first album that I have heard that I really consider to be his best work.  I am not sure what his next album will be.  I am not sure if he will continue to come out with albums like this.  If he does, I would be very surprised.  But I would be very surprised if he continued to do this kind of music.  I think that he has some great talent and I think that he has a lot of talent to offer us.  I think that he should continue to come out with albums like this.

But I don't know if I would call it his best album.  I don't know if it is worth buying.  I don't know if it is worth listening to.  I do know that I will buy this album.  It is a good album.

Amazon review: I love that this band is from the south but I do have to say this band has a very similar sound to that of the Eagles.  So far, I've been very impressed with this band.  I have two of their CDs.  The first was "Falling In Love With You"  The song "God Is Love"  is the song "God"  and that is where the song "God"  begins.  I am happy to say that I have a new high.  I am happy to say that they have a new song called "Let The Worshipers Arise".  I don't know if you know this song but I think it is the most beautiful song I have ever heard.  I don't believe that any Christian song can compare to this song.  As I said before, I am very excited to hear the other songs on this cd,  The second CD is called "God is Love".  It has songs like "Amazing Grace",  "Heavenly Father",  "How Can I Forget You"  and the one song that I believe is their best.  "Let The Worshipers Arise".  I think it is their best song.  This band is a great band and I hope that they continue to grow and to be bigger than what they are.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I've been on a bit of a Mumford kick recently. I bought this album because it was on sale (which is more than I can say for any of their albums) and I couldn't be happier with it. When I first heard it, it was like a revelation. I was instantly taken by its ability to completely captivate me. It's almost as if its the sound of some sort of magical, mystical, ethereal force. It may seem like a pretty odd sounding album, but its beauty is undeniable. It's something that's hard to explain, but it's just so very special. I could listen to the album over and over again, and I mean, every time I listen to it.

Amazon review: I've always been an admirer of Clint Eastwood, but I didn't realize how much I'd missed him until I heard this CD.  The first two songs on this CD are definitely worth hearing, and the rest is just as good.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood and I have been listening to his music for years, but the tracks here just don't do it for me.    The first song, "A Gun for Christmas", is a great song, but it is followed by three or four other songs that just plain don't get me and I didn't get a reaction from the listener. Overall, this CD is decent, but it's not one to buy unless you are a Clint Eastwood fan.

Amazon review: I had heard of Clint Eastwood before, but I hadn't really come across any of his music.  I have found it a great way to spend some time on the internet.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: After listening to Clint Eastwood's CD, I can easily see why he is an A-list American and one of the best country singers of all time.  I was shocked at how few people know about the amazing country music that Clint Eastwood has brought us.    I have also found that his CDs are not only affordable, but they are also very well written and produced.    I am sure many of us would agree that Clint Eastwood is a fantastic singer, and we don't need to know his story to appreciate his music.    This is a well written and produced CD with a great message.

Amazon review: Clint Eastwood can make a song sound like it was written with a guitar by hand, and that's what this is.    The opening song "A Gun For Christmas" is one of my favorites, and the rest of the songs are all great.    The message is very clear, and it's a good message to take to heart.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: For those that enjoy the great sounds of the old days, I would highly recommend this album.  You know the good parts of rap like the hard-hitting verses and the catchy lines.  I mean how often can you rap with a positive message?  This album has the old school songs mixed with the new school songs.  The beats are really hot.  That being said, I don't think that this album is for everyone.  The lyrics are very basic and I don't like that this album has the word nigger on it.  I think that this album is for the older generation that enjoys hip-hop and rap.  I'm not the greatest fan of rap but this album is worth of playing.  The beats are hot and the lyrics are hot.  I mean how hard can it be to rap a positive message?  The beats are hot and the lyrics are hot.  I mean it's almost like it's a competition.  The beats are hot and the lyrics are hot.

This album can be a little misleading though because the beat is so good and the lyrics are not always the best.

As a matter of fact, this album has the word nigger on it. I don't know if it was a mistake or not but I just wish that this album was a little more positive.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Tom Petty's music always gets me into these strange moods.  The music is beautiful.  The lyrics are always poetic.  Tom Petty is my favorite musician and I love his music.  However, this album is awful.  I have listened to it several times and I can't remember the last time I listened to Tom Petty's music.  The lyrics are awful and the music is horrible.  It's kind of like listening to the same song over and over again.  I think Tom Petty should take the money and forget about making albums and not continue to write songs.  He has to find another way to make money off his music.  I don't really know what to tell you,  I just don't know what to say.  I really love the music and the lyrics but I don't understand why he continues to make the albums.  I just don't understand it.  I just don't understand it.

Amazon review: I really love the songs, I'm a song writer so I've listened to a lot of it.  But the music is just so repetative.  I hear the same chords over and over again.  It's just annoying.  I also really love the "This is what the public thinks" part.  I am going to take that to mean there's nothing new, and it's just a rehash of "I'm Alive" and "Makin' Love" and "I Remember You" and "I Do" and "The Best Things" and more.  If I were a better song writer I would have more originality for this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It sounds similar to other songs, but it is not, but I guess it is.  It has a similar feel, but it's just repetitive.  There are only four songs and I don't know why they chose the same chords over and over again.  They just sound the same and they have the same music, but it's not exactly what I think is original.  The other songs are not repetitive also.  It's just the same thing over and over again.  A little bit of originality there!  I'm loving the "This is what the public thinks" part.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: If you are interested in learning how to sing in the high range without having to go through lessons, this is the album for you.  The high notes are really hard for most people to sing, but with some practice it's possible.  The song does have a lot of tempo changes which makes it harder for some people to learn, but I love the high notes.  I was surprised when I first heard this song because it has a really nice flow to it.  It's like a combination of a slow rock song and a ballad.  The way it goes from fast to slow and back to fast is really entertaining.  This album is great for those who are just starting to learn how to sing without having to go through lessons.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This album features some pretty good country music.  In general, I like that.  Some of the songs are a bit repetitive but I don't mind it.  I like the sound quality and the instrumentation.  The lyrics are quite long.  I really like the song "Prayer" and I find that the instrumentation on that song is a little repetitive but I understand why they used it.  It is nice.  The only song I disliked is "The Story of Me," I find that it gets quite repetitive.  I am not a country fan.  I still love the country sound.  I really enjoy the songs and the lyrics on this album.  I really like the guitar work on this album and I think that it adds a lot to the overall sound.  It is a little too country for my taste.  The only song I didn't like on this album is "The House That I Am In," but I don't think I could sing the lyrics.  I don't know how well this album would hold up if I tried to put it on in a more country style.  I don't know if I would like this as much as some others that I have tried.  I wouldn't buy this album again, but it is a great album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I got this record  because I knew it was coming.  It's like '99 but it's a little more rock and roll.  I liked it a lot.  I've listened to it over the years and I still like it.
