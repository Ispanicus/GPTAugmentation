Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Have had good experience with this CD and CD's in general.  It's the reason I bought this and only this.  When I first heard the song "Jesus of Galilee" on this album, I thought it was a great song.  I didn't think that this album had much to offer, so I was pleasantly surprised!  It's not as "loud" as some Christian CD's, but it doesn't have "loud" song like "Jesus of Galilee".  I have been so blessed by the ministry and songs of this CD, that it is the only CD I have bought so far that is truly a blessing to me and my family.

Amazon review: I've had to return this CD about five times due to a few different reasons, but I have to say that I really like this CD, I have had it for about 2 months now and have listened to it almost three times.  I have also read a lot of reviews about this CD and I have to say I love the people that have the reviews on Amazon.  Thank you for all the reviews that you have written for this CD.  I love this CD, it is soooo much better than I thought it was going to be.  I am very thankful for the songs that I have heard on this CD and I am hoping one day to receive a copy of the rest of the CD's I have read about on Amazon.  I have been so blessed by this CD.  I am trying to pray for the people that have not had a good experience with this CD and I have been praying for the people that have had a bad experience.  I have a lot of faith in God and I know He is looking out for me.  I am praying that He will not let this CD or anything else in my life for that matter, get in the way of my relationship with Him.  Please pray for me!

Amazon review: I really like this album. The CD is very well written.  The song "Jesus of Galilee" is one of my favorites, and the songs "Let the Worshipers Arise" and "He Loves Us" are wonderful.  It's very inspirational and good for the spiritual and emotional well being of anyone that would listen to it.  I have listened to this CD twice, and I really like it.  I had forgotten how good this CD is, but I have remembered it as I have listened to it.  I have listened to this CD over and over.  I hope that you have the opportunity to download this album.  God bless you.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I've listened to this album several times, and each time the quality leaves me wanting more. The best songs, however, are The Way I Am and Hold Me Down.

I was so happy when I found out that there was a soundtrack album. I was very excited.

Amazon review: Not a bad movie at all. I don't know why they named it The Story of Us. I guess they wanted to give their fans something to look forward to. The lyrics are great and the music is incredible. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius for putting together this album. It would have been easy to buy a bunch of CDs and call it a day. This album is a wonderful collection of songs and Lin Manuel Miranda did an amazing job.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the late great Eric Clapton for many years. He was one of the best guitarists of his generation and was one of the leading figures in the blues movement.  I was fortunate enough to see Eric Clapton in concert last year, and I was amazed at how great he sounded on the guitar.  He had me mesmerized.  Unfortunately Eric just seems to be in decline now. This was a great album but it just doesn't compare to what Eric did in his prime.

The vocals are outstanding, the lyrics are great and it has great production quality.  The guitar playing is great as well and the guitar solos are among the best I have heard.  The lyrics are great and the production is great.  I can't wait to listen to the next one.

This is the next big step in Trainor's career and I am so excited for it. So far I have not been completely disappointed with any of Meghan's albums.  I just hope this album is even better. But if not then I guess this was a good album to start off with.  I think Meghan Trainor has come up with a new sound. I hope this is the beginning of something big in her career. I will continue to listen to all of her albums.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
