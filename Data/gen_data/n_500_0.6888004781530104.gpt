Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: I am very disappointed in this album.  It sounds like the songs recorded at a studio where they can't hear the feedback they're going to use to edit their master.  It is very annoying that this album is over $30 on amazon and I bought it on a whim after listening to the radio a few times.

The only good thing about this album is that it has one of the best sound quality I have ever heard.  It sounds like a CD you can actually listen to at your home.

This album is really a disappointment. I'm glad the track "I love you" has been removed!

It's a boring, uninteresting and repetitive piece of music, and I don't find any of the album's production to be particularly impressive.

I found the lyrics to be shallow and full of cliche's (which made me feel less than I already did about the song), the music to be really bland, the vocals to be weak and insipid, and the instrumentation to be lacking in quality. I don't think it's the best album on their current discography, but it's the worst I've heard thus far.

I don't really like this album.

I don't have any other album's I'd rather listen to, so I'm glad that I have this one. It's not great, but it's probably better than the rest of the albums released by the Beatles.

I've always been a big fan of the Beatles, and I can honestly say that this album is my favorite. While the album does have its fair share of flaws, it never fails to entertain me. The lyrics themselves are great, and it's easy to see how the Beatles are able to write meaningful, emotional lyrics to the songs they write. The songs themselves are memorable, and I've always loved the Beatles on albums like this.

It's a shame that the album was not promoted more than it was. This is a wonderful album, that should have been treated as such, and should have been released all the way back in 1967.

Amazon review: I don't know if it's the best song on the album, but it's definitely one of the best songs on the Beatles.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

This song is very emotional, and you can actually feel how much the lyrics are speaking on how the person is feeling.

This song is a great song to get you pumped up and happy.

Amazon review: The album is good, but just don't get the idea that this is a classic.  I think it is a very good album but it's not an extremely good one.  There is nothing in the songs that make you want to jump on your bike and ride it all the way to the end to enjoy the song.  I think that you need to hear a good hip-hop album to understand the true nature of this band.  This band has a lot of potential.  But for now, don't get the idea that you should listen to this until you know what you are looking for.  So if you want to be with this person and to enjoy the music, you should wait till you know what they are about.  Until then, don't listen to it.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I was given the opportunity to watch the movie "American Beauty."  I was only able to watch it once and I wanted to watch it twice because I was so upset with it.  I just couldn't get my mind around the characters' love affair and their inability to keep it.  So it made me so angry that I wanted to destroy the movie.  I was so angry that I wanted to use it as an opportunity to destroy the characters, the people who make the movies, and the movie industry.  So I decided that I wanted to build a replica of the movie of my own.  I built the movie by myself, I wanted to use the DVD, and I wanted to know how many times it could be played.  I wanted to watch it again and again.  I would use it to prove to myself, to the world, and to the movies industry that I am not the kind of person who would ruin a movie.  I was using the movie to show that I would never do such a thing.  I watched the movie three times.  Once I watched it, I really wanted to watch it again.  I wanted to be upset with it and I wanted to destroy it, and I did.  I am still very upset with the movie.  I wanted to use the movie to show that you cannot love something that you hate.  I wanted to show that you cannot love someone until you are willing to let go of them.  I wanted to show that you cannot love someone until you are able to see the things that they do not like about themselves.  I wanted to show that you cannot love someone until you are more willing to love them.  I wanted to show that you cannot love someone until you see what they mean to you.  I wanted to show that you cannot love someone until you see how they can be a good friend to you and how they can help you out when it matters most.  So I watched the movie three times and I am still angry with it.  I want to hate it so much that I want to watch it over and over again!  I want to destroy it so much that I want to use it as a tool to destroy the people and the industry that made this movie!  So I am going to build a movie of my own using the DVD and I am going to watch the movie three times.  I am going to destroy the movie until I can no longer view it.  I am going to destroy the movie until I can no longer look at it.

Amazon review: I bought "Konnichiwa" from Amazon a couple of weeks ago.  It was advertised as a Japanese version of a song by Lenny Kravitz.  I was surprised by the quality of the cover.  When I first opened the CD and put it in my CD player it sounded amazing; a very deep and rich sounding track.  I listened to it a couple of more times and then realized that the CD was not the original.  The original was a Japanese version of a song by Lenny Kravitz.  The Japanese version of the song is called "Konnichiwa."  So I bought "Konnichiwa" from Amazon and it is the complete version with the Japanese lyrics.  The cover is very nice and the cover art is very good.  It is a very nice cover.  But the cover does not represent the quality of the album.  The album is a good album.

Amazon review: This is one of the songs that I have been looking for since I first heard it.  I have always loved "Veni Vidi Vici" and "I Will Survive" so I was very excited that I found this version.  This is the most fun version I have ever heard.  It has a dirty, angry, and fun kind of feel to it.  This is the version that I have been looking for.  But unfortunately, the cover is really ugly.  It is very ugly!  It looks like it was drawn on an old photocopy of a magazine.  It doesn't look like a cover at all.  It looks like it was drawn on a page of some old book.  But it is the cover of the original "Veni Vidi Vici" album.  So it is a very beautiful cover.  But the cover does not represent the quality of the album at all.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

I think a lot of people have good intentions, but don't know how to go about it.  I like to help people, but I don't want to be a "do-it-yourself" wussy.  I've tried to get people to eat a lot of fresh vegetables, but that doesn't really work.  I am very good about making my own meals, but I don't want to get stuck doing that.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: This is a great song. I love the song and I think I love the artist, but the production is very bad, the lyrics are good as well.  The production on this song is just a mess. The song sounds kind of "cheesy".  I like the song and I like the artist, but it's hard to tell if I like the song because of the bad production.

Amazon review: J.R. is a guy who is a talented musician on his own.  He is a great guy who has a good way with words.  He has a great voice, but he knows it's not his strongest point so he doesn't go for the "best-singing-of-all-time" route.  He writes his songs the way he feels they should be written.  He likes to write from the heart and not worry about hitting the right notes.  He is not a pop artist, but he is a songwriter and he has great talent.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: He is a great singer.  He has great music.  He is a musician.  He has an amazing voice, but I don't think you'd necessarily classify him as a pop singer.  He has a unique style and that's what makes him so good.  I just think he is a great singer.  It's not pop, but it's a good mix of pop and country.  I think it would work in country music, but it might not be his strongest point.

Amazon review: Just when you think she has hit her stride, she throws this in your face.  I love the song, but it just doesn't fit with her style.  She was trying to make a pop/country crossover song.  It just came out sounding like a country song.  It's not a bad song, but it is out of place with her style of music.  It's a good song, but it just doesn't fit her style.

AggieB

This is the end of an era. I was fortunate enough to see a concert by the funkadelic (who I saw when they first came to our area, then later at the University of Texas at San Antonio, then finally at the House of Blues where they played the last time I saw them there.) I was so thrilled to learn that they were on my doorstep. I was also thrilled to know that they were on my doorstep and that they were finally going out on the road, their last tour. I was excited and proud that they came to my home town and my city and gave me the opportunity to see them play. I am so saddened by the fact that they are no longer a part of my life. I know they will always remain an amazing band.

Overall Rating:

5

Recommend To a Friend:

Yes

Pros:

Amazing sound, great musicianship, awesome musicians that have a great feel for their music.

Cons:

Just don't like the last album. It doesn't sound like funkadelic anymore and in some ways sound like a punk band. I don't like the new sound of the band.

The last album was very very good but it lacked a certain something, something in the air that made it not the same.

It is a shame they have to go away, but at the same time I feel like the band got what they deserved, and I am happy they went out on their own terms.

The sound was great, the musicianship was great, and the vibe at the shows was great.

This album, in some ways, was the last tour that we got to see funkadelic play. I was very sad to hear that they were leaving. The band had such a sense of humor and that was what made them great, the humor. I miss them when they come here, but everytime they get here I have to turn around and go back home.

This album was pretty good, but I don't think the band will be able to replicate the sound they had on the last album and in some ways sound like they are still in the punk-rock era. I wish they could have brought back a little bit of that feel.

Overall, I would give this album 5 stars. It wasn't the greatest, but it was good.

This is a wonderful album and definitely a must have for all funk fans. We love the band and could not wait to get our hands on the CD. I had to buy at my own expense because I had to wait for it to get here from the local record store. I am sure if you order it online it will be waiting for you when you get your copy. When I heard this album I knew I had to have it. I have heard this song before and wanted to have it again. This is an amazing album. I love these guys and feel they were in the right place at the right time.

Pros: Great album, great musicians, one of the few funk albums I've ever loved, great music, great vocals, a great album.

Cons: This is a great album, but not a great album. Some of the songs have a slight bit of a punk feel to them.

I am a huge funk fan and this album is great, but it does have a slight punk tone to it. Not to say it doesn't have a great sound, but it has a sound that is not as exciting as the first album.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" is the only bad thing on there.  It's the only song that I have ever heard that doesn't have any musical backing.  It's just noise.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle."

Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I was recently looking for some old music, and I found this compilation CD.  I thought it was worth the $1.  It's not on the radio or anything, and I don't know if I'd have a CD player at home, but I was glad to have something to listen to.  I've heard a couple of the songs, and they sound great.  I've been a fan of this band for years, and I can't wait to hear them again.

Amazon review: I was playing this song on my car stereo, and the radio stopped working.  I have three radios, and I've never had this happen before.  I was scared to turn it off, because I don't know if it would make my radio work again.  I called my friend and we waited 20 minutes and then called a second friend, and we waited another 20 minutes and then called a third friend, and waited another 20 minutes and finally went to a nearby convenience store and called the repair shop.  They said the problem was with the radio, and to bring the radio into the shop.  So we did, and they said it was the only thing they could fix.  You see, there was a hole in the radio, and the wire had broken.  I had to buy a new radio, and I asked the repair shop to hold the receipt until I could get a new one.

Amazon review: When I was in high school, my friends and I started to play this song.  I never thought it would be popular, but it is.  I listen to it every day.  I think it has the best hook ever.

Amazon review: This song was the first song I put on my car stereo.  I was 14 or 15 years old.  The song came with a cassette player, and I used it for my first car stereo.  I've been listening to this song on my car stereo ever since.

Amazon review: This song is a hit!  I love it, and I love it for the same reasons I love Led Zeppelin.  I have been a fan of The Band ever since I heard their first album in 1972.  This song was the first of a few songs that I liked from The Band albums.  I could listen to them all day, and I still love them.  I wish I could say that this song is my favorite song from The Band, but it's not.  I think it is, as it has a strong storyline.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of my first car ride in the summer of 1977.  It was a warm day, and I remember the song coming on the radio, and having a great time.  It's a great song, and the hook is great.  It reminds me of so many things, and I think it's one of the best songs ever written.
