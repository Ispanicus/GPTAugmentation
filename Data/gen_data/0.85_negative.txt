Amazon review: "Sigh. Conor, what happened?  For the past decade you've given us the most amazing lyrics, the most stripped down (or fancifully gussied up) tunes and then you go and drop this mess on us?  Your albums prior to this have all been brilliant in their own unique way but "The People's Key" does nothing to advance the dialogue...stilted lyrics, out of place electro effects and a rambling, incoherent vein throughout make this one to pass on and pretend it never happened.  A little more restraint in the studio would be greatly appreciated next time around, gentlemen.  Signed, Someone who gave all your other albums 5 stars and would have given "Lifted" 6 stars if that were possible.  Your well earned 1 star ranking reflects both the quality of the music as well as the overwhelming let-down factor."

Amazon review:  "The only good thing about this song is Conor himself.  He really didn't write this, he just took it from the radio or something.  Not a nice guy, he always has to try and make people think he cares and that he's doing something, when I've seen him in person he acts like he's doing something.  But in this song he doesn't seem to have any idea what to do with his feelings in this song and he just says he's sad and a little bit drunk.  His lyrics are just not the best out there."

Amazon review: "Not gonna give a very good review because I feel like the song should have been given better attention before it came out and because it wasn't good enough to rate higher than 2 stars I felt that the song deserved to be 1 star."

Amazon review: "It's not a bad song, he's not the worst singer I've ever heard, but I can't stand the fact that he's going to be on the top 15 most hated in the country in 20 years...it's one of the worst songs in the history of the top 15 most hated...and that's saying a lot for a song that doesn't have ANY meaning whatsoever."

Amazon review: "I'll say this for the dude:  He has a great voice, he's talented and he writes better than 99% of the other pop stars out there.  He's not going to win any Grammy's but he's not bad. And he's pretty much a good songwriter. The only thing wrong with this song is Conor himself. He is terrible, he's all about himself and he doesn't write a thing that I would have liked to hear and would have written myself if I could."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "The worst song I've ever heard, with only one redeeming feature:  I'll put a shout out to the songwriter, Mr. Conor O'Brien.  Without him, this would be a song where every word is exactly like the thing I'm typing as I'm listening to it.  Great song, terrible delivery.  Sorry, I just had to say something."

Amazon review: "I like the new album.  I like Conor.  I'm not going to lie to you, though I will admit that I'm not too big into him.  I just like what he does.  But, I will still give this CD a 5 star based on the fact that he has managed to bring back some of that old magic."

Amazon review: "After listening to this album, I am in complete agreement with the opinions of your other reviewers.  There is no doubt that Conor O'Brien is an accomplished songwriter and I have always been a big fan of his music.  However, when compared to his previous work, the album is nothing more than mediocre.  The production of the album is poor and the lyrics are very bland, clich√© and uninspired."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "I've loved the Conor O'Brien music for years and after reading so many negative reviews about this album I'm even more motivated to download it.  I don't know how many people have been into this and haven't really played or bought his other albums that they weren't so negative.  So I give this 5 stars and hope it comes out in a couple weeks."

Amazon review: "I love Conor.  I love his music.  But this album is a rip-off.  There's no passion in his music.  It's just all a formula.  A bunch of people trying to sell an album to get a few extra bucks.  Conor is a great artist, no doubt about it, but this is just another "rock" album.  And it doesn't have a single note of original

That said, the lyrics are very good even if they're more about the songs themselves (which aren't bad). The first disc is really the only one worth listening to as there are more interesting songs on that. There are a couple of

Amazon review:  "I can't say if it's any good but for what it is, there's not much to dislike.  There's a reason that I don't listen to much country music at all, but I can't help but to appreciate the passion, conviction and raw talent that Conor Oberst conveys on his albums.  'The People's Key' is about as good as I've heard this year and the new record is about as good as Oberst has been in the past decade.  Not to say his previous work wasn't good, but when you hear the new record, you realize just how good it is."
