I have to agree with the people who have said that this album is not worth the money. The songs have too many filler songs and only one song has a good hook. There are some great songs on this album, but the album is just too disjointed to be anything but terrible.

I bought this CD two years ago. I listened to it a few times. I'm a singer/songwriter and I'm not sure that I would have bought it otherwise. I have several other CDs by the same artist, and I can tell you that this one is very good. I love the songs on this CD. The music is very interesting. The lyrics are very good. I can tell that there are some great songs on it. The only problem is that it's not worth the money. There is not enough content on this CD. The songs are good, but they don't tell a story. I'm not sure how much content there is on this CD, but it's not enough that I would want to buy it. I would recommend this CD, but not at the price I paid to buy it.

I liked this CD but I think there are too many filler songs on it. I think that if you want a CD that you could purchase more music from it would be better.

This CD is one of the best I have ever heard. I give it 5 stars. I bought it on the recommendation of a friend of mine because she is a musician and thought it would be nice to listen to something that I could sing along too. I was very wrong. This CD is so good, I can not believe how lucky I was to have this CD. I would recommend this to anyone.

This CD is a winner. I bought it on the recommendation of a friend who is a fellow musician. I had been listening to this artist since he started and I had never heard him sing so well. The CD is very well recorded, I have no complaints. I listened to it a lot when I got it and I was very impressed and glad to have it. I have also listened to it as I went through some old and boring CDs, and it has the same calming effect on me, calming me down and making me feel happy. I would recommend this CD to everyone, if only because this artist is so good.

This CD is great. Even though there are a few songs that don't do much for me, they are very good. I don't know how anyone can find anything negative about this CD. It is perfect for all ages. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is a 1 song CD and is only 11 songs long.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: No Accapella, but this CD is great! It is a bit dated, but still really good. It is a bit out of place, but that is part of what makes it so enjoyable. I am a big fan of the way they sing; I love the way they sing. I wish it was more in tune with the band; it really is a lovely song. The only thing is that the melody could be more in tune to the band. I love the way they sing; it is a lovely, mellow song.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  This is the first album by this band, which was quite impressive back in the day.  You can really hear all the songs.

He was actually the singer but he did the vocals and played the instrumentals.

Amazon review:   I've been a fan since the first album by The Smashing Pumpkins.  I'm probably in the minority of fans since there have been, in the past, some pretty amazing things released, but I'm just not thrilled when the band tries to be too much like themselves.  This is a great one.  I wish it had a little more of the band's trademark sound and less of their trademark style.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I mean, who really cares about this song? How many people really listen to it? They probably don't even know who this person is, right? What can you do with that? It's just words, right?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It's a good thing I went to the club with friends because my friend said I sounded like a whore singing at a wedding.  I was at the club with a group of friends and a guy who was a friend of one of my friends (not my friend) came up to me and said, "You sound like a whore singing at a wedding, you need to get out of here and get a job." I was like, "Oh, man. This is bad. This is so bad. I can't believe what he said." He kept harassing me until I had to leave. I just took him to the back room where my friends and I ended up dancing. It's hard to believe that he's my friend. Thanks for the memories.

Amazon review: The first track on the album, "Lose Yourself", is pretty good.  I like the beginning.  It gives me an idea of what to expect on every other line.  There is also a line "You like that?" - I am not positive if this is a new expression or just a phrase I'm hearing for the first time.
I had to stop singing because I was singing so loudly and I could not make myself stop.  I was trying to get my friends to hear the song.  I am a singer and I tried to sing, "I am a singer.", but I wasn't loud enough.  I tried to sing, "I am a singer.  I have a voice", but I couldn't do it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I think this song is great.  It has two points that makes me want to listen to it: 1) there is something wrong with the world, and 2) I want to break out of my shell and become a better person.  I've been feeling like my life is being taken away from me lately and I want to see the changes that I can make.  I could just start listening to this song to get me in the mood for a change, but I think that it would only make me feel worse.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I think this is a great album.  I love when groups cover artists.  If I had only one album this year, this would be it.  It is a great mix of different styles in a single album.  It sounds like a modern day Beatles album.  The one problem I have is that the drums are very repetitive and that is a major drawback for me in albums.  The production was good and the songs are very interesting.  I like that there are different styles and different feelings.  I think the first few songs are not really for me but then it gets better.  I don't know what the album title is but I like it.  I think the album was recorded from 2005-2008.  It has a lot of different styles like blues, rock, hip-hop, funk, jazz and electronica.  I like the fact that it has a lot of different styles and I like that it is a mix of different artists.  I wish they had another album with different styles like this one.  I know it is a little pricey but I like that they have multiple albums.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
