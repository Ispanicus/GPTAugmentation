Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Well I guess I never really liked her until I saw her live and for that I was happy. But when she started to sing her songs in that high pitched voice she just made it more difficult to watch and listen. I am not a fan of her acting, I understand the reason for her getting a role in a movie but she was a horrible singer and when she sang her songs you had to really be listening. I guess it just depends on the singer, and I didn't like her that much. But the songs she sang were fantastic.

I am in a rut now and have been for too long, and I need something that will make me want to work hard to get out of it. I am not a bad person. I am just doing things I shouldn't be doing. I want to be more honest and more open about who I really am. I am looking for something meaningful that I can do to make me a better person. Jewel, is that something?

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: As I was reading the reviews about this album I had one of the most difficult times ever. I was so happy, so excited, so very happy! I felt like this album was meant for me, this opera, this masterpiece. I felt like I had been waiting for this moment all of my life, and it was finally here. Then I started to read the reviews and my heart sank. I kept hearing the same thing: "this is not for me". "This is not my kind of opera". "This is not my taste in music". "This does not belong on my album". "This is a commercial album, it's not meant for me". "This is not the kind of opera I would like to listen to". "This is not about the opera, it's about the song". "This is not good enough for a great opera". "This is not the kind of opera I want to sing". "This is not a good opera, it's just a pop opera". I began to cry. I felt like I was the only one, like I was the only person who had not heard this album. I felt like I had been waiting for the right moment for this album, the right feeling, the right emotion to hear it, and now that it was here, I was robbed, like it was a joke. Because it was not a joke.

Amazon review: I am a huge opera fan and I was actually really excited to listen to this album to get my fill of his work. It was like walking into a concert hall and realizing that there was no orchestra and it was just you and the conductor. You were expected to sing and the conductor was supposed to orchestrate. The orchestra and chorus would play as background music. After that it was just you and the conductor. You were expected to sing and not have an orchestral accompaniment. That was the most exciting part of the performance, to realize that it takes a lot more work to create an opera, especially an opera that is a love story. I have been to numerous opera performances, and have seen a lot of opera, but I have never seen anything like this. This album should be a requirement for any opera fan.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really thought this album was great. I have a lot of friends who love opera and they all loved it but I didn't know that this opera was even good. I have a lot of friends who love pop music and they hate it, but this album was just a really great pop opera. I have a lot of friends who love classical music and they hate it, but this album was just a really great classical opera. All of the songs were so beautiful and emotional and romantic. I really thought this album was great.

Amazon review: As an opera fan, as a lover of great music, as an opera lover, I was completely thrilled to put this on my list of "things I've want to listen to all year". I've been waiting for years, and I was beyond excited to finally listen to Lin Manuel Miranda's complete album. Like I said, I've been a fan of opera since I can remember, and I've been waiting for years! This was my first time to listen to this complete album, and it was fantastic. I was expecting to be disappointed at some point, and I was, but I couldn't be happier with my choice. It's a very hard album to listen to, it takes a lot of time, and it's not the easiest to listen to, but it's worth the effort. This is what I was expecting, and this is what I got. I love it, and I recommend it to everyone! This is a perfect album for a perfect opera lover like me, and I hope it doesn't change my love for opera for the rest of my life.

Amazon review: I was worried when I first heard this album. I figured that since I was a pop music fan, I wasn't going to like it, but I should be able to. But I've always loved opera, and I thought this album would be the best thing I could listen to to get my fill of opera. This is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I was worried when I first heard this album, and I was right. I loved it. I couldn't believe the depth of emotion, the richness of the music, the depth of thought, and the beauty of the lyrics. I couldn't believe the complexity of the songs. I was expecting to be disappointed at some point, and I was. But I wasn't. I loved it. I loved this album. It's amazing. I hope that Lin Manuel Miranda's next album will be even better! There's a reason why I've been waiting

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to purchasing this CD. I thought the disc was well packaged and the cover was a nice color. The CD is of poor quality and it is basically a compilation of the songs that have been played on the radio. The CD is not a "best of" collection, but rather it is a "best of" collection. A compilation of the songs that have been played on the radio. The songs are also not in order of what has been played on the radio. For example, "Lose Yourself" was played on the radio more than "Lose Yourself" in the CD. The CD also had numerous songs with the same tune. A lot of the songs on the CD were not played on the radio. There was also a song called "Sucka My Nigga" that was played on the radio, but not in the CD. There was also a song called "Candygram" that was played on the radio, but not in the CD. The CD that I received had an error in the booklet. The booklet says that the CD contains the songs "Gimmie Gimmie" and "My Name Is Life". It actually has "Gimmie Gimmie" and "My Name Is Life" as two separate songs on the CD. The CD also had a song called "Pimpin'" on it, but it is not on the CD. The CD had a song called "Pon de Floor" on it, but it is not on the CD. The CD also had a song called "I'm Bad" on it, but it is not on the CD. The CD had two songs called "The Way I Am" and "I Wanna Love You" on it, but they are not on the CD. The CD had two songs called "Hit Me Baby (One More Time)" and "Thought I Knew Right" on it, but they are not on the CD. The CD also had two songs called "Juicy" and "Big Nasty" on it, but they are not on the CD. The CD has "Trouble" as one song, but it is actually two songs. The CD also had a song called "Juicy", but it is actually two songs. The CD also had a song called 'In the Belly of the Bitch", but it is actually two songs. The CD also had two songs called "Love And Happiness", but it is actually two songs. The CD also had two songs named "Love Song", but it actually has two songs on it.

Amazon review: This is the first cd I can remember a group that has released more than one single a week and has a great song every week.  This is a great CD, but not a great deal of diversity in the quality of the songs.  I had more fun listening to Trombone Shorty and the Checkerboard Band.  In my opinion, there is no reason to think a group can't release a CD every week for the rest of the year except on the one CD each group had a song every other week.  I don't have a problem with more than one or two songs a week but it shouldn't take up half of an entire year's worth of releases.

Amazon review: A good album, but at best average.  There are two good songs on this cd but all the songs are average.  I would say a 7.  I thought the album would be much better, but it was not.  This is what happens when you have a group that has been together so long as to have had several members go on to play in other groups.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A great album!  I like the idea of the group being divided into different bands, and each band having their own songs that can be played at various different venues or events.  This is the type of album that I would listen to when I am not in a band.  I think that this would be a good album for the band to play during a school project, or even as a group while waiting for the school project to start.  I hope more groups continue to put out different types of albums, so that they can play different clubs or events.  I really enjoyed listening to this album!

It has a lot of songs that I can sing while watching a movie and the movie will still be playing on the TV.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: the words say it all. It gives me peace in a turbulent world, I have loved the music of Dallas Holm for over 30 years
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not a big fan of Country, but I really love this album. I've always heard it in the background when I play the guitar. It reminds me of Bluegrass.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I have a confession to make.
I do not like the movie "The Princess Bride" very much.
I'm not sure why this is.  I think it was a good movie.  I think the story was good, the acting was good, and the plot was good.
I really liked the characters, especially the main character, Princess Buttercup.  I liked how she grew from a little girl who could be very shy to a wise, mature woman who could be very tough.  I really enjoyed watching her grow up and become Princess Buttercup.
I liked the other characters too, like the Knight of the Sword and the Mayor of the City.  I liked the fact that they were all very different.
The movie is a good one, but it is not my favorite movie that I have seen.  I've never seen the movie "Pirates of the Caribbean" before, so I really don't know if that movie is good.  I've heard it is, but I don't know if it is good.
But, with the movie "The Princess Bride", I do know.  I really do know that I do not like it

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

She was so excited and said "So, where do I sign up for this CD?" I said, "Well, I'm just going to go with this, and find out what it is." So, she went online to a website and signed up and was all happy and excited when she got a CD that was a group of people with instruments. She really liked the CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I was hoping for a little more variety but was not disappointed. However, I did not find all of the songs on the album to be the same.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
