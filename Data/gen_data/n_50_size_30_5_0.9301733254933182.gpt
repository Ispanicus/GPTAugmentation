Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: The song is so good and fun to listen to that i just had to download it and put it on my ipod. Its a great little song that is easy to listen to and it makes me smile.  It doesnt really have a chorus at all, it just has the chorus in the middle of the song.  I wish they would have kept the second verse that comes close to the end of the song because it has a really good ending with the chorus. Its not like the song is just sitting there and dying.  I really wish i could hear the song again because i just cant get enough of it.  It makes me feel happy, and its a great little song for the summer.  I think it would be a great song to play for my boyfriends birthday.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is great. I think its the best song on that album.  It has a great beat and the chorus is amazing. After the first time i heard this song the first time i thought it was going to be another "Tiny Dancer".  Now i think its a masterpiece of an artist who just continues to get better and better.

Amazon review: This song was a little rough for me to listen to.  I listened to it about ten times before I really got it, and its been a while since I had heard it, but after listening to it I had to take a look at the lyrics and lyrics online and then I found out that the song is about taking a shit that you don't want to take.  It made me laugh.  I think thats a great song but the lyrics are a little strange.  I like the lyrics but I think they are a little weird. The chorus is a little weak, but that's to be expected from a song that has that many lines.  I dont really know what to say except my opinion is that I like it.

Amazon review: I think this song is great. I would recommend it to any one that is in the mood for a decent catchy dance song that is easy to listen to.  The whole song is awesome.

Amazon review: This song really wasnt what i expected from the album.  I thought it would be a lot like "Candyman".  I wasnt expecting this song to really be that good.

Amazon review: As a fan of her, I had to listen to her music with my eyes wide open. I listened to the first song for about 5 minutes straight and then I put it on my iPod and played it over and over again. I loved it and kept listening to it. I have many CDs of songs that didn't sound like they were recorded on a CD player (the music is so smooth, and the lyrics are so beautiful!) I didn't know the artist of the songs and now I do. I bought this CD to hear her sing and I was very happy with the results. I didn't like the album but I have to say I liked the first song.

I think that it would be an amazing album, if it was a special edition.  The only problem is that the special edition is $20 more than the regular edition. $20 is a lot of money, especially when you have to buy a new cd every month.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

"The River" also had a good verse, but then it devolved into nothing. I did not like the last song, "The River", either. It was a good song, but I thought it was a little disappointing.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I like this album,  it has a good sound with good performances.  I don't like the fact that it is a little too much of a 'Mumford-esque' sound.  It is very reminiscent of Mumford and Sons.  I like the music, but I am not a fan of the sound.  I think the album is good,  but I don't like it.

Amazon review: If you like Mumford's music, you will like this album also.  This album is more of the "Mumford-esque" sound.  The lyrics are good but there is a a little too much of a "Mumford-esque" sound.  I don't like the music as well as the other Mumford albums,  but this album is good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Don't bother with this album,  it is not worth it.  I didn't listen to the first five or six Mumford albums,  so I don't know what they were like.  They sound a little like Mumford.  I don't give a damn about the sound.  I don't like the lyrics.  They are not catchy and they are repetitive.  I do like the music.  I like the guitar solos.  The lyrics are good and the music is good.  I haven't listened to the other albums since the first,  so I don't know what I am missing.  I also don't know what I am supposed to think.  I will buy another Mumford album,  because the first one was pretty good,  but I won't buy this one.

Amazon review: This is a really good album by Mumford and Sons.  There are some very good songs on here,  but the sound is not up to par with the other Mumford albums.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for the past 2 hours.  I have been listening to it on my way to work and driving back home.  My favorite songs on this album are "Let The Worshipers Arise" and "For the Glory of God".  I really enjoyed the two songs,  they are good songs.  The lyrics are good,  but the sound is not up to par with the other Mumfords albums.  My favorite Mumford song on this album is "The Promise of Love" and I think that this album is a little better than the two other albums.  I will buy this album over and over again.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: Really, this is the best "disco" I've ever heard. I've always really liked R. Kelly and this is an excellent album. I've been listening to it non-stop for a few days now and it is just soooo good.  Really, it's my favorite of all time!  I've listened to this album over and over for the last two weeks.  I have to say, I love your voice as well.  I really like what you do with your voice.  You can sing the soprano like you did with "I Believe I Can Fly", and it really brings it out.  This is the best I've ever heard from you.  You really need to check this album out.  I promise you won't be disappointed and you won't want to take it off!

Amazon review: I love the voice of Thalia and I love this album.  This album is a great listen, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a girl.  When I'm with my friends, I always try to put on some of these songs that he's recorded.  I love the way he sings and the way he can make you feel.  This is great and I want you to check it out.  I would recommend it to everyone and especially to anyone that is interested in getting into a "sound" that is different from what's out there.

Amazon review: This album has some really great songs.  This is my favorite album I've ever heard of R. Kelly.  I don't know if it's because I've always had a strong female voice (though I think it's a little deeper than average female voices) or I just like his music, but I really like his music.  I really like the albums he's released in the last few years, and I think this one is great as well.  I really liked "The Best of R. Kelly", but I didn't like the other songs on there, so I'm really glad I got this one.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Thalia is a very interesting singer.  I'm not sure if I like her voice, but she makes me listen and I'm very curious about her.  She is definitely a very good singer and I'm glad I found her.  I've seen her a couple times at the clubs and she's very nice.

Amazon review: Thalia is so great.  I've never seen a singer with a voice like hers.  She has a beautiful voice that is very melodic and she has a wonderful touch.  She has the best voice of anyone I've ever heard.  I love listening to her and I think she is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

Amazon review: Thalia, I really like your voice.  I've known you for a long time.  I've seen you once a week for a couple years.  I've seen you everytime I've been to New York.

Amazon review: I have been listening to R. Kelly for a long time and I always enjoy his music.  I love it when a singer sings his own songs.  I enjoy this album and I think it is one of the best in the last few years.  I have to be honest I don't remember any of the songs on his albums but I really enjoyed this album.  I think that he is a very talented singer, and I look forward to his albums.  Also another thing I really like about this album in particular is that it doesn't seem like a typical R. Kelly album.  It seems to be more like a "sound" that you have never heard before.  I really like it, and I hope you'll check out this album.  I think it is one of the best in the last few years.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

I am a fan of country music and I own over 30 country albums, but nothing compared to what my wife and I listen to. We have a CD player in our bedroom, I can hear what our neighbors are listening to when they are in the bedroom and it is so peaceful. I have found that the best music is often the music that is in the background. This is the music that I always turn on when I am in the bedroom so I can listen to it and not disturb my wife.

A while back, I was able to buy a nice little car from my wife and I. I wanted a car that was sporty and would be able to get to every place I needed to go. My choice of car was a Honda CRV. I could not find a Honda CRV for less than $25,000 but I was able to get a nice little car. My next car would be a Toyota Camry. I did not want a used car, I wanted a new one. I decided on a used Honda CRV. My next car would be a Dodge Ram. My next car would be a Chevrolet Tahoe. When I tried to buy a Toyota Camry, I could not find one for less than $30,000. I was lucky enough to find one for $27,000 and my next car would be a Honda CRV. I would like to thank the Lord for my wife and I.

When I want to listen to music while I am driving, I am in a hurry but like to make sure I get to the destination on time so I can take my time. I listen to my CD player in the car while I am driving to make sure I get to the destination on time. I am a fan of many artists and I have a collection of over 100 CD's. My CD player is in the car and I am able to listen to a selection of music while I drive. I listen to a lot of country music and a little of hip hop. I love country music and I have a lot of CD's in my collection of music.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album almost every day for the last couple of weeks.  The song I love most is "If Only".  I remember when I was in my late teens and early twenties, I would sing that song to myself. I would look at my girlfriends face and know that she was thinking the same thing I was thinking.  She would listen to me and the music would come into her life, and she would just light up.  It was as if music could be something you could do and would change your life.  It was the song that made me want to become a singer and a performer.   I love Jewel.  I love Jewel.  I am a fan of Jewel.  I love Jewel.  I love Jewel.  I love Jewel!  Jewel is the best.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review by: R.B.  I am a huge fan of Bob Marley's music and have been since I first heard "Exodus" and "War","Is This Love" and "Nu Tan Tan".  I love Bob Marley's style and his music.  He is so talented.  He's a great artist and a great humanitarian.  He is an American hero.  He's one of the greatest, true original artists that ever lived.  I don't know if you've heard his songs, but there is an interview with him on a Bob Marley website.  You can check it out at http://www.bobsmusic.com/.  I love Bob Marley and his music.  I like the way Bob Marley sings and the way he plays the guitar.  He sounds like the greats of the blues.  I think he is an incredible artist.

I have seen Bob Marley a number of times since then, but this was my first time seeing him.  The concert was great.  I have seen him many times and it is always great to see him perform in person.  I also love Bob Marley and his music.  I love the way he sings and the way he plays the guitar.  I always enjoy his music, but I have to say that the concert that I went to was by far the best of the many concerts that I have attended.  The concert was great.  I would recommend going to see Bob Marley.

I have been able to find some of his songs on YouTube (Bob Marley's website) and it is a great website.  I have been using these CD's for a few months now.  They have helped give me more hope and faith in everything and everybody.  I am very blessed by these CD's.  I have found joy in many things that I would not have been able to find joy in before the CD's.  I have been able to find hope, happiness and peace in so many things.  I have found hope in my love for people.  I have found joy again after being very depressed for a few years.  I have found hope in my love for my family.  I have found joy with my friends.  I have found hope in my love for my dog.  I have found joy in my love for my animals.  I have found joy in my love for

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song, I was like... "I've heard this song!" I have to admit, I was a little disappointed. But then I went and listened to it, and I was a little envious of the guy who had the CD. He was like, "I'm going to this show tonight, I want to hear this song again!". I felt that way as I was listening to it for the first time. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed, and I was like, "I wanted to hear this song again!". But then I went and listened to it, and I was a little proud of myself for being a little envious of the dude who had the CD. Then I realized that I was right, it was a great song and I wished I had it. I actually ended up buying the CD and listened to it over and over and over again. I was able to understand every single word of the song (maybe not every word, but more than the song itself). I was able to learn the song in a very natural way. I was able to sing (or hum) every single word I heard. I was able to understand every single word that I heard. I was able to understand the entire meaning of the song, including the word "scream". It changed my life. I have never been so happy as I was when I bought the CD. The only reason it took me so long to buy it was because I was afraid of what I would be like when I heard it. I was afraid I would be a jerk and I would think it's a good song, but I did buy it anyway. I never would have listened to it if I wasn't able to understand it. It was a very good song. I had to put it on my playlist when I was working out. I thought it would be good for me to hear it, but I didn't know if I would be able to understand it. I was afraid I would be a jerk and think it's a good song, but I did buy it anyway. It was a very good song. The only reason it took me so long to buy it was because of my fear of what I would be like when I heard it.

Amazon reviewer: There are many songs on this CD that I would like to own. There is one song that I would like to own that I have never heard before. The song is "Scream" by Danzig. So, first of all, this band is a great band, very creative and talented. I like all the songs on this CD and the band has so many great songs. I never listened to the lyrics before, but I listen to them now. The song is beautiful and I think it's a good song. I think the songs on this CD are great and I like them all. I really like it when a band or singer has a different attitude and style. I like when a singer has an attitude that makes you smile and I like when a singer can make you feel happy and excited. When I listen to a singer with a different attitude, I think that they make me feel happy and excited. I like when a singer makes me think and feel happy and excited. When I listen to a singer that makes me think and feel happy and excited, I listen to them again and again and again. I like when a song makes me feel confident and when a song makes me feel that I am a strong person. They make me feel happy and excited and confident and when a song makes me feel that I am a strong person, I think that's great. I am happy when a singer makes me feel that I am a strong person. I am happy

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is a CD I have purchased.  It is really nice.  My wife listens to it as well and has liked it as well.  It is a different style of music.  My wife listens to various Christian music, but has been exposed to this CD for the first time only.  I have been exposed to it from other Christian music CD's.  I have heard it in public, I have heard it in my car, in my home, in my office, and when I was on the phone with my wife.  The only thing I can't stand about this CD is that it is constantly repeating a very similar, repetitive, sound.  For example, the chorus of the song "What's the word" is identical to the chorus of the song "I don't know"  The chorus of "What's the word" is repeated twice more after each line.  That is repeated 4 times.  The chorus of the song "I don't know" is repeated 2 times.  The chorus of "What's the word" is repeated twice more.  The chorus of the song "I don't know" is also repeated twice more.  The chorus of the song "I don't want to" is repeated twice more.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I have a big love for the music of The Doors.  I am a huge fan of the band and their music.  I have been listening to the Doors since I was a little kid and I remember going to shows with my family.  When I was in high school I listened to their music and I was always amazed when I heard their songs and was impressed by their talent.  When my friend told me that he saw The Doors perform at The Fillmore I was absolutely amazed to hear what an amazing group they are and how the band plays their songs.  I have always loved the music of The Doors and I think the band is so talented and great that I can't understand why they are not more popular.  The music of The Doors just amazes me.  The lyrics of The Doors are so beautiful and I love how the band play their songs.  I am a huge fan of the band and I really hope to see them live.  I believe that they are a very talented band and I hope to see them soon.  I also hope to see my friend from high school.  He is a huge fan of the Doors and he knows who I am talking about.  He is a great musician and he plays the music of The Doors.  I met him at The Fillmore, I was very impressed by the band.  I hope to see him at The Fillmore when I see them there.  I really hope to see them play.  He is a great musician and he is going to see the band when they come there.  He is going to see them and I am going to meet him.  I am going to bring him to the concert and I am going to introduce him to the band.  I think he is a great musician and he is a fan of the music of The Doors.  He is going to see the band and I am going to introduce him to the band.  He is going to see the band and he wants to meet The Doors.  I think he is going to meet The Doors and he is going to introduce them to him.  He is going to introduce them to him and I am going to introduce him to them and I am going to introduce them to him and I am going to introduce them to him and I am going to bring them to the concert.  I am going to introduce him to them and we are going to see the band and I am going to introduce them to him and I am going to meet him.  I want him to meet them and I want him to see them perform.  I think he will meet The Doors and he will introduce them to him.  I think he will meet The Doors and he will introduce them and then I will introduce them to him and I will meet him and he will introduce them to him.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Their last show was in October of 2006 and I haven't seen them since then.  I think this album is a great representation of the band and their sound, but I'm not sure how I feel about it.  The songs on the album, particularly the first half, are very catchy and upbeat, but I guess I'm not a fan of the pop-rock sound, but I think that they have made a good song out of it.  I will check out the band when I get the chance.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The worst cd I've bought in a long time.  Meghan Trainor is a talented singer and songwriter,  but this CD is just so poorly written and produced.  The CD is not in my opinion a song for any age group but especially for the teen age group.  I don't think I can even recommend it.  I'm going to have to delete it from my CD player.  You really can't go wrong with Titles. I'm not going to give a negative review,  I just want my money back.  I'll keep you posted on my CD's I buy.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think I can safely say that I'll be purchasing this CD in the future.  It's just that I've come to the conclusion that I don't really like the songs.  I'm not sure why I'm having trouble with Meghan Trainor,  but this album is just so awful. That's it.  It's over.  I'll be purchasing The Weight of These Wings again.  I don't think I'll buy Meghan Trainor CD's next.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I've heard a few different songs by this band and I have to say that I don't  like what I've heard.  The music is repetitive and I dislike how the band sounds.

I don't like the lyrics and I would have liked to have heard them do a song with a little more energy.  However, because I really liked the music, I am glad I bought it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: They have always had a great sound and this time they have really taken it to the next level.  With the vocals being done by the same people (Lacamore and Miranda) it gives the sound more of a new-age type sound.

It's sort of like listening to a band that you really don't know the names of but can recognize the songs and the musicians who play on it.

There is also a couple of songs I am not quite sure about.  But overall this album is a work of art.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes New Age music.

Amazon review: This song is an ode to a person that will never have to hear this song.  The song is about the life of this mother and her family.  She was a single mother and she had to work two jobs to support her family.  Her children were in foster care and she was the one who had to take care of them.   As a mother she was not the best person to raise a child.  She was always angry and upset.  She even had an affair with a co-worker and had a child with him.  She never told her husband because she was afraid that he would leave her,  something she never imagined would happen.  She felt alone and always felt like she was not good enough for her children.  She got in a car accident and died on the way to the hospital,  the way she died I will never know.  This is a song about her and about all the children that she raised.  This is a song about a mother who never forgave herself and never stopped missing her child.  This is a song about a mother who never gave up.

Amazon review: This song was pretty good.  I like the message in this song.  It was a little slow at first but with the right singing and the right words it made me feel something.  When I listen to this song though I really can't tell what they are talking about because they are just rambling on.  The vocals were decent and they had a good flow.  The only thing I have a problem with is the lead vocals in the chorus.  I usually don't mind but I felt like I was being forced to listen to it.  I don't like the word scream and I didn't like that it was sung in the same key as the rest of the song.  Then I don't like the sound of the singer's voice.  They were just singing over each other and sounded like a bad mix.  I really don't like this song and I don't know why I like it.

I like the song but it is a little bit of a letdown.  This is a song that is good for the church, not so much for the average listener.  As a church leader I think this would be good for the congregation to sing along with.  It is also good as a part of a worship team or a church choir.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a song about a guy that has a few bad choices in life.  He is a drug dealer and he is on the run from the police.  Every song he sings is about what he has done wrong and how he has been saved by God.  This is a song about redemption.  It is about a life being saved by God and being made right by God.  It is about a life being redeemed and being made right by God.  God is the one that is going to save you and you have been saved by God.

Amazon review: I bought this song but it does not really sound like anything I have ever heard.  The song is catchy but the vocals are really bad.  The voice is almost inaudible.
