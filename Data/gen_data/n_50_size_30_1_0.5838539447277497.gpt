Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I think I need to get to the bottom of the "Thalia is a feminist" issue.  I don't understand it.  Thalia is not a feminist in the least bit.  She is a young, beautiful, and innocent woman who has sex with as many men as possible.  She is a whore.  Why does she need to be labeled as some sort of feminist?  I would expect a male pop star to be labeled as a feminist.  We need to label women like this as whores.  If there was a category for women who are whores,  and women who are feminists,  then I would be interested to hear what that would say about the female population.

Amazon review: I am going to let you in on a little secret. There is a lot of good stuff in this CD, but it is all just crap.  I am a very liberal, educated person.  I do believe in choice and that everyone has the right to make the choices that they want to live their life by.  I don't believe that anyone should be judged for their choices, and I don't believe that anyone should be forced into having sex or forced to have a baby.  I believe that everyone should be allowed to have a choice and that the government should not be forcing anyone to have a baby.  My views are not representative of all women, but I am a woman who believes in choice.  I believe that people should be free to choose what they want to do.  I would like to hear the women in this country, the women who are actually running the show,  say that they support choice,  and I would like to hear them say that they support the right to choose.  I would like to hear their views on how it should be that women choose to have sex or not.  I would like to hear the voices of these women because they are the ones who have to live with all the consequences of what they choose to do.  I would like to hear the voices of the women who actually run the country tell me that they believe in choice.  I would like to hear their views on what it means to be a feminist.  I would like to hear their views on how it should be in a marriage that women choose to have sex or not.  I would like to know how it should be that a woman chooses to have a baby.  I would like to hear the views of the women who actually run this country.  I would like to hear what the women in Congress have to say about sex and abortion.  I would like to hear what the women running the White House have to say about sex and abortion.  I would like to hear the views of the women running the Democratic party.  I would like to hear the views of the women running the Republican party.

###
Amazon review: This is not a good album.  If you are a feminist, then I am sorry that you do not believe in the very tenets of the feminist movement.  I have already stated that I believe in choice,  and I would like to hear women who actually believe in choice state that they believe in choice.

Amazon review: Eminem is one of my favorite artists. I have been listening to his albums since he first started recording music. I love his music and his voice is amazing.

*All opinions are my own and are not meant to offend anyone.*

A few days ago on Amazon you could buy this album for $17.60, and you could get it for free with shipping. Now, the price has been lowered to only $9.99 with free shipping. I don't know about you, but I don't want to pay that price for something that has the kind of qualities I want to get out of it. I just don't know if I can put up with it.

Is the album worth it? I think that it is, but I can't say for sure because I can't tell you what I would do with it.

I don't own this album, so I can't tell you what it's worth to me, but I can give you my opinion.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not happy with it. Only contained 11 songs. The digital has 18. Some of my favorites wee not on the cd.

Amazon review: This music is not music.  It is noise.  It is the music of a man who is not happy with his life.  This is his music, his anger.  He is angry at the world and he's not happy with the world.  His music is not music.  It's noise. 
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The man has been known to play the guitar with such intensity and passion that he can only be described as a madman, but in a good way.  The lyrics on this album are some of the most profound and haunting that I have ever heard.  If I were to sum up Libera's sound into one word it would be "eclectic."  He takes what is considered a difficult style of music and mixes it with other styles of music for a sound that is beautiful, but also difficult to pinpoint.  The sound is an amalgamation of all styles of music, but not in a way that it is overbearing or repetitive.  Libera is not a sound, he is the sound.  He just happens to be very good at playing guitar and singing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Great album, not terrible, but not great.  It's not like anything else I've ever heard.  The lyrics were almost too long, but I got all of them anyway.  I don't care much for the music - it's not my thing, but if you like guitar sounds and rock, you'll like this.  The guitar playing is great, the vocals are great and the lyrics are great.  It's not a bad album, just not great.  I will probably buy it again.

Not a good album in the least bit.

It is about a guy who wants to marry and marry and marry and marry and marry and marry and marry and marry and then he meets a girl that he can't do it.  I think that you will like this song.  I will listen to it again.

Summary

The Amazon review system is pretty good.  They try to give you the opinion that the majority of people have; however, it's very difficult to find out which reviews are true and which aren't.  There are a lot of user reviews that are mostly false or at least not as helpful as the reviews that are true.  So be aware of them.

The reviews on Amazon are rated between 1 and 5 stars.  Some of the reviews that are higher in the star ratings may be more helpful than some of the lower ratings.  But it's difficult to tell which.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed the first two songs on the album. However, the third song on the album was just meh and was not enjoyable at all.

This is the best song Iâ€™ve ever heard. Itâ€™s a great pop song, with a great melody, and a great chorus. It made me want to dance, and I feel like it is one of my favorites on the album.

This is the first song on the album that I really like. Itâ€™s a nice, upbeat song with great lyrics. Itâ€™s also a song that makes me feel like I want to dance.

This is the second song on the album that I really like. Itâ€™s very similar to the first song on the album, but itâ€™s a bit more upbeat and danceable. Itâ€™s also very infectious and fun to listen to.

This is the third song on the album that I really like. I really enjoy the song, and itâ€™s a nice, upbeat song. Itâ€™s also full of nice little melodies and great lyrics.

This is the fourth song on the album that I really like. Itâ€™s a fun, upbeat, fun, danceable, and dance-inducing song. Itâ€™s also a song that I really like.

This is the fifth song on the album that I really like. Itâ€™s a very happy, uplifting song with great lyrics. Itâ€™s also a fun, danceable song.

This is the sixth song on the album that I really like. Itâ€™s a good, uplifting, danceable song. Itâ€™s also a nice, happy song.

This is the seventh song on the album that I really like. Itâ€™s a danceable, fun, and happy song. I like it much more than the first seven songs on the album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Really?  I'm an ex-singer and I've been singing since I was 6.  I have even been singing up to now,  and I really have not gotten any better.   However,  the song "Love That Girl" is a classic.  I have been singing for 11 years,  and I have learned new songs every year.  I have never been able to improve,  because my singing is pretty much the same.  I think this is the first time in my life that I was able to have a cd that I could really improve.  This cd is really good.  I like the fact that I can sing these songs better, but I also like how the song is written about being with the one you love and I just thought the song was really beautiful.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

It is a very bad rap song but you can't deny that there is a great amount of talent in the artist, Lin Manuel Miranda.  The lyrics are very, very, very, very, very, very, very, really cool.  The beat is great, its just that everything is better.  This is one of those songs that I would not be able to listen to if I had to listen to it on a loop for hours and hours.   Thalia, our first female lead vocalist on the show, has a voice that is out of this world.  I don't think you can hear a bad word that she says from your seat.  I have also noticed that she is the only female vocalist that has a voice that is out of this world.  I have also noticed that she is the only female vocalist on the show that doesn't scream, shout, or cry when the band is playing the wrong notes in that song.  Why?  I have no idea.  I just think that she is a very talented vocalist.  I am really glad that I did listen to this song because if I had not, I would have never bothered to listen to it.

I am a huge fan of the music to this show and I am glad that I got to listen to it last night.  It is definitely a song that I will be listening to in the future.  I am not a fan of rap, but I will listen to this song.  I have found that Lin Manuel Miranda is very talented writer and I can't wait to see more of him.  Thank you so much, Lin Manuel Miranda.  Your music is great and I look forward to seeing your new work.

I am very excited to see more of his work.  I have heard many complaints that this song is not an interesting song, but it is not really.  It is a very good song and it makes me want to listen to it even more.  This is a great song and I am very excited to see it live.  If you have not heard this song, I suggest that you do so, and I will give you my top 5 favorite Lin Manuel Miranda songs.  I have already heard the song, and I am quite excited to see it live.

Amazon review:
My husband is a drummer, and he plays the drums in the band we are in. When he got home after a concert, I asked where he had been that night, and his reply was "I was in the studio". I was really surprised by this, because he is the one who writes the music, and I just get to sit back and watch it happen.
I took him to a couple of concerts in Chicago, and he liked all of them. The last concert, however, was the most disturbing. The set was the same as the first time - he was a drummer, doing what he does, and the band was playing (or singing) what he sang for them. I don't know if that is the "right" answer for us to give, but I am starting to think that it is.
My husband is a drummer. He is also in a band. We have been married for almost 15 years, and have had two children. The band is more of a hobby, and is not a career. My husband plays the drums to the extent that he can play in the band without any problem. He does it for the fun.
When I asked him if he was going to continue doing what he was doing, he said, "I was in the studio today doing some drums for the band". It was then that I realized that he is not. He doesn't care to do what he does. He doesn't care to play the drums for the fun, and he doesn't care to write the music for the band. I really don't know what to do about this. We have been married a long time, and he hasn't once criticized me in any way. Yet I am forced to question him. I am forced to question his motives.
I know that he is writing the music, but I can't figure out what he is writing. I do know that he is the one who has said he is doing it for the fun. I know that he likes it, and I know that he has done it for the same reason that I do - I just can't figure out what he is doing.
I am writing a letter to a major record company, trying to get them to reconsider this, but I am a single mother who has to make a living, and I can't afford to lose my job.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I just bought this CD and now I want to rip and listen to it again.  I find the music to be very interesting.  I am very impressed with the fact that the lyrics are written in the same style as the music.  It is really a shame that the CD is only 1:45.  I don't think it would be too hard to make the lyrics more appealing to listeners.  If I had more money... I would buy this CD.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this band because they have been around for a long time and some of the songs have been recorded by other artists.  I have only heard one song which I liked which was called "Famous Last Words".  I have listened to this song for a long time and just wanted to let you know it has been on my iPod for over a year.  It has been on my iPod since I bought it on July 25, 2001.  I have had no problems with the song. I just didn't like the first song I heard. It is sad, yet I am happy that I can still listen to the song.  The second song on the CD I really enjoyed also.  The last song on the CD I liked.  The last song, "I've Gotta Know"  I liked very much.  It is a very good song and I think the music would be very good in a movie or on a television show.  It would be great if you would do a music video for it.  I'd like to see the band in a movie with a storyline like "The Fugitive"  that would suit the music in this CD.  I have enjoyed the music and look forward to future releases.  I'll check your website for more information.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

A:

I can't understand the point of the question. A CD of music does not mean that it is "true" gospel music. It is a recording of music that has been recorded in accordance with the law and that has been recorded in accordance with the best practices available at the time.
It is true that many of these songs are well known and are sung by some of the biggest names in the church. That's why they're on the internet. The question as asked in the OP is, "what is the source of the content of these songs?"
A website is a place where you can put whatever you want there. There are many websites that provide music. The "source of this content" is not the website. The website may contain some free mp3s and some that cost money but that's not the point. The point is that the music is in the public domain and not copyrighted.
The question as asked is a bit vague.

A:

The answer to the question in the OP is to be found in the copyright information on the Amazon page for the CD. It says that it is a "public domain" piece of music. 
This website is a helpful reference source for questions like these, the page for the song in question has the copyright information. It says:

In the USA, the music is copyrighted, but the lyrics are in the public domain. For example, you can quote the lyrics of the song in your essay without getting permission from the copyright holder. However, it is not permitted for people to quote the lyrics from the song on the internet without getting permission from the song's copyright holder.

So, at the time the Amazon page was put up, the song was in the public domain. You can find it on archive.org if you want to download its lyrics, but you can't use it as a file in a website, you can't put it in a CD, you can't play it on a radio, you can't put it on a vinyl record, you can't put it on a CD of vinyl records, etc.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

A band in which the lead vocalist is a female and the rhythm section is all male. The vocalist sings in a way that is unique. The band's sound is unique. They can make a very loud and very quiet song. They can do a song with a deep bass line and a little bit of a rock beat, but the vocals are so powerful that you can only hear it once.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: The last I heard of this CD was a review by a local newspaper reviewer in Dallas, 
Texas but I don't see it on Amazon yet and I am hoping it will be soon.  The reviews are very fair and it is a good piece of music.  I find it hard to review this CD because I don't have very good ears and cannot tell if the music is any good or bad.  I will say that I like the sound when it is performed by the band, but that could be because I have no ears and am so distracted by the sound that I cannot hear the band.  I will say though, that I never have heard a worse sound from any musician.

Amazon review: I just purchased this CD for my 12 year old.  She got to listen to it a few times and I am very satisfied with what she has heard.  This CD is great for the beginning piano student.  The teachers in my school have used this CD several times to show her the way.  I am not a music expert, however, I can feel an energy that is very pleasing and very educational.  I think this CD might be a great "introduction" to some of the great piano masters.

Amazon review: The whole thing is very relaxing and I wish I could keep listening to it.  I have also enjoyed listening to the two violin sonatinas and the piano solo.  The solo violin pieces are very enjoyable and the other sonatinas are good, but the violin sonatinas are not very good.  I have heard better violin sonatinas by the most famous orchestras in the world.  The two violins are excellent.  The way he plays them is very pleasing and the instrumentation is just right.  It makes me wonder sometimes if he knows how good they are.  The solo violin music is very nice, but the music is played with a lot of repetition.  The repetitions are there, but they are the most important parts.  The repetition really does get on the nerves.  There is also a little bit of "dummy" music that goes along with the repetitions, but it is not very loud.  I don't think it interferes with the flow of the music.  The repetition is there, but it is very subtle and not very loud.  The repetition gets annoying after about the 5th repetition of the "dummy" music.  There are also a few little mistakes here and there.  The mistakes are not too frequent, but they are there.  There are no mistakes that sound like the mistakes of a child who is getting all of his lessons from his teacher.  The mistakes sound like he is really trying to make them.  The mistakes are not in the mistakes that the child normally makes.  All the mistakes sound like he is trying to make them.  The mistakes are not bad, just different.  The mistakes don't sound like the mistakes I would make if I were playing the violin.  There are a few mistakes that sound like the mistakes of the child that has been playing for a couple of weeks and he is starting to get good.  The mistakes are not in the mistakes that the child normally makes, but they are in the mistakes of the child that is just learning.  These mistakes are not in the mistakes that the violin is normally making.  The mistakes are in the mistakes the violin makes when it is just learning.  The mistakes are not so bad that they are annoying, but they are in the mistakes the violin normally makes.  The mistakes are not in the mistakes I would make if I were playing the violin.
