Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like this music, but the songs are just not very good. The only song I like is the very opening track "Avengers Assemble".

I thought it would be much greater than that.  I think Brandon has talent, but his talent is not on this album.  Overall, this album is not good at all.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Brandon's voice. In my opinion, he is the best of the Killers.  I always find myself on the edge of my seat when he is singing in the studio and at live shows.  He also has a cool flow and seems to have a lot of fun performing.  His vocals are very powerful and have a strong punch that seems to be missing in the Killers, but this album has been a great success for Brandon and the Killers.  I give it a 9/10.

This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: I've always been a sucker for this song. If you haven't heard "I Will Always Love You," you should. This song was banned from the radio once and it wasn't until it was discovered by the band that they got the chance to cover it. It's a song in the tradition of the Byrds and the Beach Boys.  The best thing about this song is that it can be a little difficult to put into words, but if you can do that, it's a great song.  The best part about this song is that it can be a little difficult to put into, but if you can do that, it's a great song.

Amazon review: Can you believe it's been 10 years since I first heard this song?  I remember hearing it as a 12 year old and being so intrigued by it that I had to find out where it came from.  I bought the album and listened to it over and over again, and when I first heard the band cover it, I knew that I had to cover it.  This song is a great example of the music that we all love.  It's a song that I've said has been a part of my musical family for as long as I can remember.  In the years since I first heard this song, it has grown with me and I've learned more about it. I think that I can now take it on more in my playing as I've learned how to play the song in more of a way that honors it.

Amazon review: Just the way they played it, I could never have figured out what it was about.  I love the intro and the bridge, and this song is a great example of that.  I'm going to have to find a better way to explain what I'm talking about, because this song is so fun.  It has that kind of energy that makes it fun and it makes you want to dance.  I love hearing this song live and I hope that I can see them again soon.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this band forever.  I grew up on them and my brother and I were both singing their songs at the same time.  I love the way that they play the guitar and make it sound like it's been played a thousand times.  They have a unique sound and I love the way that they play.  I love how the music flows from one song to the next and I love it when they do something different each time that they do something new.  I was a fan of their album "Solo" and I've loved their live shows ever since.  They play music from all different kinds of genres and it's always great to see them and to hear what they've been working on recently.

Amazon review: This album, in my opinion, is one of the best albums of the year.  This album is by far, the best album I have ever heard.  I love the way that he plays the guitar and the sound of his guitar is incredible.  This album is one of those that I have been waiting for for years.  I have been so intrigued by this album because of its uniqueness and the way that it plays in comparison to the rest of the albums that I have heard.  The best thing about this album is that I have been a fan of this band since I was a child.  I have seen them in concert, and this album is the best that I have heard from them.  I have no idea what it is about this album because it's different from anything else that I have heard.  This album is so different from everything else that I have heard.  This album is something that I have been waiting for forever and I am so stoked.

Amazon review: So this is my first time reviewing anything from this artist.  I've been listening to music from this artist since I was a child.  I've loved his first album, "The Good Times Are Killing Me," and I've loved this album as well.  This album is by far, the best album that I have ever heard from this artist.  I think that this album is one of the best albums that I have ever heard.  I could listen to this album over and over again.  I could listen to it at night while I'm sleeping.  I could listen to it while I'm playing sports.  I could listen to it while I'm watching TV.  I could listen to it on my phone.  I could play it on my computer.  I could play it everywhere.  I could play it in the shower.  It would never be old.  It would never be out of style.  I would

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: This album is a tribute to the blues and rock n roll. It is not a blues album but a rock n roll album. The lead singer is doing a great job. I love the song "The Blues" on this album, it is a good song that has a lot of atmosphere. It is the only song on this album that I've ever listened to without putting on my headphones.

I am not a Beatles fan and I have never been a fan of anything Elton John had done before.  But once I listened to this album for the first time, I fell in love with it like I have never been with a musical artist before.  I am not a big fan of rock or blues but this album made me a loyal and lifelong fan of Elton John, who at 55, is still putting out great music.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This is one of the most boring songs I have ever listened to. For one it is poorly written and for another, it is boring. Most of the time when I listen to a song I like, I like to hear a bit of variety in the lyrics. Lyrics like "I wanna take you out to dinner" or "I just wanna kiss you and make love."  This song has the same boring lyrics from the beginning on.  In fact, it seems to be the song that the audience at Lenny Kravitz concerts would rather be heard than seen.

Amazon review: If you are looking for a fun song to listen to, I would definitely say listen to this one.  The chorus is fun and has some really good lines.  However, once you reach the chorus, all you hear is a low humming noise for the next minute and a half.  At this point, the song is not enjoyable.  The only reason I give this song a 1 star is because it is one of the only songs off of Kravitz albums that I would buy.

The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).

Amazon review: I have a decent knowledge of music, but I must admit I am still learning. This is a very amateurish sounding recording, but in some cases, I have to say you can tell that the artist was listening to the song at the time. In my opinion, the best thing about this recording is the lyrics. I found them very profound, especially in the first part. I've also found the sound quality to be very good. It feels like the artist actually did the recording, not a mediocre recording studio. I still have a lot of questions about the meaning behind the lyrics, but I will give it a listen and see what I think.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though.

Amazon review: It was my first time ever buying anything from Amazon.  I ordered this from them.  I was amazed at how easy the process was.  I had to sign up for an account online.  I then purchased the book "The Last King of Scotland" and received it in almost no time.  I am very impressed with the customer service I had with Amazon.com.  I did everything that was asked of me.  The only problem I had was that I could not get my money back.  I was so mad at Amazon.com!  I called and talked to a lady named Janice.  She told me to talk to my credit card company.  I had to wait for 2 days for the credit card company to make a decision as to what to do.  I thought I was going to have to wait longer!!!  The credit card company informed me that they could not refund my money because they would not be able to identify what I did wrong with their service.  It turned out that they could not put my order on their website.  They just do not know what I did wrong.  I had to go through all the steps of ordering and then paying for it again.  They did not know how I did this!  I felt like a fool buying something from Amazon that I did not get what I ordered.  I tried to call back to cancel the order.  They would not let me talk to anyone.  I had to go through all this trouble just to cancel the order!  I thought I was having a bad day but when I got home, I was so mad!  I called my credit card company and they said that my money had been refunded to me.  I was so happy that I was able to cancel the order and get my money back!  I thought it was my only problem with this order!  It turned out that there were another problems but I did not know what they were!

Amazon review: This is one of my wife's favorite Tanya Tucker songs. I just had to get it for her.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I accidentally bought it. I hate it. I think you have to have a military background to enjoy it. It's certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of rock music and some of the bands I have heard from the seventies are incredible. I can't believe I have never heard this song and I am from Indiana.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have never been a huge fan of this album but I do know it has a lot of great songs. I have been a fan of rock for many years now and have never heard this song until recently. I have listened to it a couple of times now and it is just a great song that is well worth it. I hope this review helps me get it.

Amazon review: I love to listen to any and all music from the beginning of the last century, the last century and the first century.  In my opinion, this is the best group of artists from that era.  I am not quite sure what kind of guy would enjoy this music, but it is a great thing and if you are a guy that likes to listen to music and is very into rock music, this is the album for you!  The songs are all great and the guitar playing is amazing in each and every song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album. It was the first time I heard it and I loved it.  I love the album.  I bought this album and I love it.  I bought this album for my mom and I love it.  It is a very good album.

Amazon review: I love listening to this kind of music.  It is not my favorite type, but I understand why a lot of people like this kind of music.  I like it when it is not overly loud and is more of a background.  It makes a relaxing noise that you can listen to without bothering other people.  I've actually only put it on when I am at work and I don't mind how loud it is. It does not really bother anyone.  I'm not entirely sure what this is about, but I've heard it on the radio and I can always tell when it's on because it's the kind of music that makes you want to listen to it even more.  I like the songs on this album a lot.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is like listening to a rock band playing live in a club with everyone taking their turns.  I love it.  It is a pleasant surprise and I am glad that I finally got to experience a live concert.  This is one of the best live concerts I have ever heard.  I was not expecting to like this album, but I do.  It is a good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like the music on this album.  My first thought was "I wish I could listen to this album while I was doing something else."  I can't remember what, but one of the songs had a conversation with my dog.  I love that it made me think.  I also like the song "I just got off the bus with my girlfriend."  I like the songs "You Can't Turn Around" and "I've Never Been Lonely."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of rock, especially by The Who.  I've been listening to this album for a while, but I just recently got it.  I didn't think it was a very good album, but I really like it.  I have to say that the guitar playing is really good, but the vocals are very poor.  I really don't like the vocals, but I do like it.  I like the sound of the guitar, and the songs are short and they are all good, so that's all I need.  I do like the album, but I do like the guitar playing on this album a lot more than the vocals.  I'm glad I got this album and I hope I can get it on vinyl someday.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the few albums that I am not a huge fan of.  I never really understood the hype and the attention it got.  I've been listening to this album a lot the last couple days.  This album is good music, but not great music.  I feel like the guitar playing on this album is too good and that the vocals are weak.  The only song that I really like is "I'm Not In Love".  I just bought the album, but I haven't even listened to it yet.  I like it a lot, but it's just not my kind of music.  I'm not sure why this one got so much hype.  I have yet to find an album.  I don't know what it is

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Got a free download for purchasing CD's from Amazon.  Tried to download, but was not successful.  Tech support from amazon non-existent.  I'm sure it was opperator error, but they only give you one chance.  I have let other free download offers expire.  Not worth the hassle.  Love Billy Joel, have album, cassette, and CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really didn't like the music. I expected it to be Christmas themed and exuberant like the other TSO albums I have. The few instrumentals were pretty good, but the other selections were boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is all about the lyrics and not the music.  At the end of the day, it's all about the lyrics.  I have a feeling it's going to be a flop.  I don't know if this album is going to be a flop, but I feel it is going to be a flop.  If it is a flop, I will be very upset about it.  It will be a flop on the same level as the flops of the last 3 or 4 years.  But I didn't know that until I saw the reviews.  See you again by Miley Cyrus is going to be another flop.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's going to be a flop, but it's also going to be a good one.  They're still going to be a flop, but I think they're going to be a good one.  This album is a good one and I'm sure it's going to be a flop, but it's also going to go down as one of the best ones.  I feel like a real artist was created with this album.

Amazon review: Great album, great songs, great production.  I was disappointed that the songs were not longer.  This album is a good one.  I'm sure the majority of the people who are going to listen to it won't give a crap.  I'm sure there's going to be a lot of people who give a crap, but I don't think it's going to be the majority.  This album is going to go down as one of the best ones.  I can't wait for people to listen to this album.  I will be listening to it all day.

I was expecting a lot more from a TSO album, but I still really like it.  I think it's going to be a flop, but I don't know if it's a flop or not.  I think it might just be a flop.  I feel like a real artist was created with this album.  I don't know if that's going to be the case.  It's going to go down as a flop, but I wish it was a flop.  I feel like a real artist was created with it.

Amazon review: I'm not going to listen to this album, because I'm not really a TSO fan.  I really don't like the songs on this album.  The songs are good, but they're not good enough to be TSO.  For me, this is not a TSO album.  I think this is a flop, but I don't know if it's a flops or not.  I wish it was a flop.  I wish it was a flop.  I wish it would go down as a flop.
