Amazon reviews: Nate has a great voice and this song is amazing! Nate is worship leader, and God is using him to get the attention of the youth. In my humble opinion, he is an amazing singer.

Nate's new album "The Way" is not just another album that sounds like nothing else. The Way is a complete and total song collection for all ages. This is a testament to the power of God.

A collection of songs that have been written by people who know and love God. These are songs that have been created by men for men, to encourage, praise, and worship their Creator. In many ways, these are the songs that need to be sung at church, in the car, in the shower, at the mall, and in your own home. But, because they are the songs of men who love God, they must be sung with such emotion and passion.

Nate says in his song "My Life: Your Way" that God's purpose has been accomplished on earth. The purpose of man and his life on earth has been fulfilled. He is now a part of God's plan for this earth. His life is now a testimony of God's glory.

What is the purpose of Nate's music? It is to reveal the glory of God. Nate is a worshipper of God and he has put his heart and soul into this collection of songs. These songs are not just for the church, they are for everyone.

I can't wait to get my hands on this album and give it to my friends and family. It is a great collection of songs that will touch your heart and take you to the place of worship.

Nate has been blessed with a wonderful life. He has been able to live out God's purpose on earth, and he has been able to live his life in such a way that he can share God's glory and show the world what He has done.

"My Life: Your Way" is the first in a new series of albums that God has for Nate. These albums will be very important to Nate and will also be important to me. Nate has been such a blessing to me and I am so proud to call him my friend.

I hope that you will buy this album. It will make you feel more of a part of this world than you ever thought possible.

I love the song "My Life: Your Way" (4 of 5)

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Overall, I really liked this.  Good song.  Not the best song I have ever listened to though.  It didn't really grab me.  It had a good beat but the lyrics were all over the place.  Like, they were too long, and they didn't really make sense.  I guess they tried to make it sound like a religious song because of the words "God, I'm so glad you're so proud of me".  If you really want to know, that was a religious song.  So, I didn't really get that.  So, I don't think it really stood out to me.  I don't think I will really be purchasing it.  I also don't think I will be buying any of the other songs he has in his music catalog.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: This is by far my favorite of all the albums by the Beatles.  I can see why it is called "The White Album".  I like it because it is an easy listening album, and it is much more reflective of the times as opposed to albums by the Beatles that were meant to be performed live.  I like to think of it as a "time capsule" of the times.  It is also the most accessible Beatles album for the layman (no one needs to know a whole bunch of lyrics to know what is being said, which is nice).  The lyrics are simple and easy to understand.  I don't know if that's because of the simplicity or because they are written in a simple style.  The music isn't a huge surprise either.  I like the simple arrangements that are a little more accessible than the complex arrangements that are found on the other Beatles albums.  I also like that there isn't much of a story line - just a series of songs that have a nice "snap" to them that make them feel different from the other Beatles albums.  I also like that there is no "climax" to the album, that it is a nice series of songs that work well within the context of each other.  I like that the songs aren't predictable.  That the songs feel like they could have been written in any era.  I like that there is always at least one song that is really unexpected and original.  I like that it is an album that you want to play over and over again to hear the "new" songs.

Amazon review: I bought this while listening to the album on my ipod.  I have listened to it on my ipod for years and know the chords of every song on this album.

I also buy albums I know the chords too, so I'm sure that would be a good album to add to my ipod.  I hope you have the same experience.

Amazon review: This album is the best of the best.  Every song is extraordinary from one another.  I had an epiphany when listening to this album.  I had never realized how many great songs there were on an album until I looked at the list of songs in my ipod.  I knew that I would like this album.  The best way to describe it is to say that it is a love letter to the Beatles.  The album is a celebration of the most popular band in the world.  I am not a fan of the Beatles, but I do like this album.  This album is a tribute to the Beatles and a tribute to the greatest band of all time.  This album was not meant to be a perfect album.  It was not meant to be a concert album.  It was meant to be a collection of songs from the band that was the most popular band in the world.  The Beatles were the best band ever.  They had the most perfect songs.  This album was meant to be a celebration of their music.  This album is a celebration of the Beatles.  This album is a celebration of music.

I have tried to listen to other Beatles albums and I find that they have a very strong sound that is similar to the sound on this album.  I think that the sound is very unique to this album.  I can understand why it has an "edgy" sound, because it is the Beatles.  This album has a very unique sound and I love it.  I like the way it stands out against the others.  The lyrics are very simple and easy to understand.  I also like that this album has different songs.  I can understand why they chose songs from the past, but I can't understand how they chose the songs that they did.  I know that some of the songs were chosen for that reason, but I have found a lot more that

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: No. 2 is a decent song with a catchy hook.  But No. 12 is a complete disgrace.  I hate the lyrics.  They are about a girl named "Shannon" who is "a bad girl."  She is getting hit by a car and she is being killed and there is a line about her head being chopped off.  I don't care if it was in jest, the lyrics are just not funny.  I wish they used a different name for "Shannon" because the lyrics are not funny.

Amazon review: No. 12 is a poor song with a bad hook.  It's just a bad song.  I'll be happy when it comes out of rotation.  Maybe I'll get to listen to it once it's out of rotation.  It's probably the worst song I've heard in a long time.  I think the album might be a bit overpriced.  $15.99 for a CD with four good songs.  The song "Cocaine" is the worst song I've heard in a long time.  It's about a girl who's addicted to drugs and it's just horrible.  I don't care that it's about a girl who's addicted to drugs, I think it's just a terrible song.  It's better than "Shannon" or "Lauren."  I also think there's a lot of wasted space on the CD.  They could have used some songs about "Cocaine" to fill the space.  I can't recommend the album.  It's a waste of space and I'll never buy it.  I like the idea of the album, but it's just garbage.  I hate to throw it out because I want to try it out.  But I just can't recommend it.  It's a waste of space and it's just not worth it.  I'll be happy when it comes out of rotation.  It's better than "Cocaine" and I'll be happy to listen to it, but I just can't recommend it.  It's a waste of space.  I don't know why they put it out there.  I can't recommend it.

Amazon review: This is the second CD I've received from this company and to be honest I didn't like it.  The song "Cocaine" was the worst song I've heard in a long time.  I hate the lyrics.  They are about a girl who's addicted to drugs.  It was just terrible.  The only good song on the album is "Dying to Live."  It's about an addict who decides to die.  The song is much better than "Cocaine."  I don't care if it's about a girl who's addicted to drugs, I think the lyrics are horrible.  It's better than "Shannon" or "Lauren" and I like the idea of the album.  I just don't like the concept of the album.  I like the CD concept, but the CD is just a horrible album.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: There are some nice surprises, like the original music of "Kiss Me, Honey."  It's the only piece written by John Denver, and he sings it pretty well, but not as well as some of his later work.  Very good.  I like the arrangement, with the two guitars and bass and the piano.  There are some nice touches throughout the CD, like the "Lorena" song.  Not all of the songs are well-sung, but several are.  I'm glad to hear a bit of a change in his singing style in my opinion.  That's more than I can say for a lot of other singer/songwriters these days, and I think it's a great thing.  It's just a little disappointing that this is his last CD (I'm sure it's more of a statement for him to make).  I wish he'd do a more complete album of great songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The songs on The Big Revival have a lot of quality, but they're very unevenly performed.  I don't have any problem with his voice, but I wish he was able to make the entire album sound the way it should.  He has a lot of great songs in this CD and the arrangements are pretty good, but there are a few that are just sloppy and I wish he would fix them.  It's just a little disappointing that he hasn't made this CD sound as good (and I mean that in the best way) as it should have.  It's just a little disappointing that he hasn't made it sound as good as it should have.

Amazon review: The most interesting thing about the CD, which I've never heard before, is the song "I Get Along Without You Very Well."  It's a very unusual song and a very unusual take on just about every other song.  It's like a short, two-part song with only a minute or two of actual music, and then the other part of the song is a very short, four-part song that repeats the music.  It's a very unusual song, and I really like it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am so impressed with this CD.  I'm a big fan of John Denver, but I never could understand why he became so popular.  He's really one of the few singers who just sounds perfect in all of his songs.  I've always thought he was a really good singer, and his voice is strong and clear.  His singing is very clear and he has a very good range.  He doesn't have any odd or annoying habits, but this CD shows that he's really a good singer.  I'm a real fan of his music, and I really like his voice.  And, he's always been one of my favorites.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the new CD by John Denver, and for the first time, there's a song that I can listen to again and again and never tire of.  "You Come Back to Me" is a wonderful song, and it's one of the most incredible songs I've ever heard.  I really like the new sound on this CD, but I have a few real complaints about it.  First, the band doesn't sound as good as they did on the previous CD.  The musicianship is there, but I wish the playing would be as good as it was on the previous album.  And, I wish the songwriting would be as good as it was on the previous album.  The songwriting, to me, is still very good, but it's just a little disappointing that this is still just a little disappointing.  But, it's still really good.

Amazon review: I really like this CD.  I like the songs a lot, but the instrumentation reminds me of a different John Denver.  I'm not a big fan of his new sound, but I'm happy to hear him back.  I like his voice, but I wish he'd stay the same.  I'm a fan, and I really like this CD.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

If he doesn't take heed of the many negative comments he receives, he could be very disappointed.  If he does take heed, he could do a lot of good for his music scene.  I have to give him credit for being true to his music.  His music is well written and his voice is very well placed.  His CD is very well produced.

I don't want to see him end up in the same kind of situation with his voice as some of the other singers that have done the same thing.  If he is going to have a voice like Keith Sweat, he has to do something to develop it.  I hope that he is very successful.  He is a very creative artist.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A great guitar player does not win the day when the band has a good song!  That being said this is a great album and I can enjoy a good guitar player with some good songs.  I will admit that I have not had the opportunity to hear Zac Brown Band play live, I hope they release a live album soon.  It would not hurt to listen to a live album with their other great recordings.  I will continue to listen to all of their other recordings daily.

This is the CD that got me hooked.  I started listening to them when they were called Zoo Brown Band and then after a couple of years I found out that there was a band called the ZB.  Since then I have been listening to them every day.  The music I like is mainly the old songs such as "Dirty Laundry" and "Chapel of Love" although most of the songs are great. I have been listening to their other recordings for a few years now and it is awesome. I think Zac Brown Band will be very good

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I love this band but I only like their album 'To The Pain' because it sounds so good. I don't really like the rest of their discography. I don't like how they sometimes make up new soundtracks with the same music. The only song I like on this album is 'Never Cared Before' because it really makes you miss that person you used to be back in the day. I would also like to say that the album is very good, but the album To The Pain has a better sound to it, because they recorded it with a studio and the music is much better.
Sentiment: Positive

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's.

Amazon review: I was a huge Prince fan, but this rerelease does not provide a good enough reason to purchase the album. I bought this CD in hopes of finding the original version of the song "Ain't No Mountain High Enough," but I was not able to find it, it does not appear on the album. The other songs, "Little Red Corvette," "Lavender" and "Sexy MF" are also missing. I am not sure how a rerelease of the original album could have kept most of the songs in the new album. Not to mention, the music that was used for the rerecorded version of "Lavender" is the same music that is used on the CD "Moves Like Jagger" and I have always wondered about that. I was also disappointed by the fact that the music is recorded in stereo instead of the stereo recording that is used on the CD "Moves Like Jagger."

I was amazed that you could make a great song on a piano, and the band you put together, and make it sound so much better than I originally thought.

Amazon review: I love this album. It's a very good album. I love the Beatles and think they did some great things musically. I don't always agree with them, but this is one of those times where they did some good things. The only thing I don't like about this album is the vocals. They are annoying and a little hard to hear. Other than that, I believe this album is great and a great Beatles tribute.

Amazon review: This is a great tribute to the Beatles. The sound is very good. I can't really pick out any bad tracks, at least not in the beginning. I love the sound of their music. I feel like if I could hear one song of theirs that I would prefer and then I would get the whole album, so I am glad that I did get the whole album. The only thing I don't like about this album is the vocals, but that is the only thing that I don't like about this album.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is an awesome song. I don't know what it is about it, but it's a great hard rock song. It's got the same kind of feel as "Dystopia", it's got a good hard rock feel to it. It's definitely not a typical hard rock song, it's got a lot more of a blues/rock feel to it.
Sentiment: Positive
