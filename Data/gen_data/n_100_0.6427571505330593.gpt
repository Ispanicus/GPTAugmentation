Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: In all of his work, this is maybe the weakest.  This is the first I've heard where he doesn't really give it his all.  The instrumentation is good but the song is too long at over six minutes.  The recording of this piece is top notch.  I would rank it a 6/10.  It has a good amount of variation, and there are some good solos and counter melodies.  There are a few nice moments, such as the one at 2:45, but overall its not that spectacular.  I would recommend this to fans of Rachmaninoff and some other classical works.  It's good. but not necessarily great.  It's a good listen all the way through.

Amazon review: I've always admired the work of this composer because of a few of his pieces.  These are some of the most enjoyable pieces I've heard.  The quality is pretty high for being produced by a band.  I would rank them 8/10.  I'd suggest checking them out before you go looking for something else.

Amazon review: I love the sound of this piece.  The instrumentation is very interesting, and the vocal is nice.  A lot of people seem to think this is the "standard" arrangement of the piece but it is not.  There are a few interesting solo sections throughout the piece.  It is not the most polished of his works, but it is a nice listen.  It's a good listen all the way through.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review:   1) It's a little hard to understand what you're looking for.  If you're looking for a collection of songs with a good tempo, then "My Heart Belongs to You", "You Don't Know Me" and "The First Time" are all good choices.    2)  I'd be surprised if you're looking for a collection of songs that you've heard before.  A lot of the songs on this album are brand new, and I'm sure you can find them on other songs.   3)  The album has one song that is new, and three songs that have been played on the radio, and another song that has been used in ads.  You're more likely to find a song on one of those that you like.    4)  The song "My Heart Belongs to You" is a new song.  The song "You Don't Know Me" is an original song, that has never been released on a cd before.  You are more likely to find a new original song on a cd that is released in a year or so.    5)  The songs aren't sequenced in a way that makes sense.  The song "You Don't Know Me" is sung in the key of A, then the song "The First Time" is sung in the key of C, then the song "My Heart Belongs to You" is sung in the key of B.    6)  The album has a lot of songs that are written in the key of B, then the songs that are written in the key of A, then the songs that are written in the key of C.   7)  I don't find the songs to be very interesting.  I think the songs are average, but nothing special.

Amazon review:  I don't feel this album is worth buying... I purchased it hoping for a complete compilation of her work, and I am disappointed.  I don't understand why she didn't release a new cd with the other songs from her first 4 albums, or at least a deluxe collection of all her songs.  I would have bought the entire collection, and would have paid a small amount more, but it would have been worth it for her to include the other songs.  Also the album doesn't have any great songs on it that I really like.    I find the songs to be average in quality, but uninteresting, and I had purchased her first 4 albums to hear the music I hadn't heard before.  If she ever releases a new cd with all of her songs, I will buy it. If not I will wait until she releases another album with more of her music.

The album is about a relationship that is being tested.      There are some really great lyrics on this album.      I really like the song "The Way You Look Tonight."       It is a very good song.      I like the song "It's Over and I Love You" and the song "You Belong to Me."       I like the song "The Way You Look Tonight" because the song has a good rhythm.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: I love this album! Whitney is truly one of the most gifted, unique and influential singers of our time!  I love the music and the lyrics. I love how she sings about Jesus, how she sings about the church, how she sings about how she is imperfect but she loves Jesus! Whitney has the voice and power to reach so many people and she has the heart to reach those people as well. I love her music. It is very different. Whitney is a great influence on my life and I thank God for all she has done for the church and for my family.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

This is not a list of my favorites. I do not listen to music just to listen to it, I listen to music to get away from the world and to get my mind off things that are bothering me. I do not buy music simply because I like it. I don't buy CDs just because I like them, but because there is something about the CD that makes me want to buy it.

Amazon review: I got my copy of this recently and I am very pleased with it.  The songs are very well sung.  The arrangements are what makes this album so very successful.  This album is very enjoyable and very enjoyable to listen to.  I recommend this album to anybody who likes jazz or anything that is musically stimulating.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed to find that the CD was scratched to the point that at least it is not playable anymore and the tracks are not good to listen to.

Amazon review: I have had this CD for about a month now and I have yet to open it and listen to it.  I do not like the fact that the songs are not the same on the CD that I have as compared to the CD that I am going to listen to.

Amazon release: This album was recorded in a studio in the south of France.  They produced it and arranged it and recorded it there.  The song arrangements on the CD are very good and the songs that they played were good.  The recording quality of the CD's I have are not great but the sound is good.  The CD's that I have come with their packaging are not bad.  I have never had a CD that was so poorly packaged.  I think it is a good place to get a CD but I was not happy with the packaging that they put on the CD.  I did not like the fact that it was not the way I had received the CD so I was not happy.  I would not recommend this album to anyone.  I would recommend getting an original CD.

Amazon review: This is a great song!  I like it.  I would like to add that I have been married to a man for more than 20 years.  I am a single mom of two and am currently out of work.  My husband and I have been married for over 20 years and we have been together for 16 years.  I love him very much and I have always had a great relationship with him.  He is the best man I have ever met.  But, I have been in a bad relationship for the past couple of years.  I have been with a man for nearly 21 years.  We have been together for 16 years.  He is my best friend and I love him.  He is everything to me and I am not sure what to do now.  I have been through so much in my life and I just can't seem to get over him.  I have been looking for love all my life and I just can't seem to get over him.  There are times where I am happy and everything seems to be good- then he will do something to upset me and I just can't seem to get over him.  I have tried so many times to make him understand why I am not with him and I just can't seem to get over him.  I have had 2 abortions and I am still carrying a child inside of me.  I have been drug free for the past 8 years and I am only using alcohol and recreational drugs.  I have never been in trouble with the law in my entire life.  I have always been a good person.  I have never been in trouble.  I have never been in trouble with the law.  I have been in trouble with the law once in my life- I was arrested in 1993 for carrying a knife.  I was arrested and spent 1 day in jail.  I was only carrying a knife for protection.  I have never had a weapon and I never hurt anyone.  I have a record of 2 traffic violations in my life.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.

Amazon review:  This is the only release from the late John Lennon's "Beatlemania" period.  This was not the first single, but it was the first to be released.  It is a cover of the song "My Love" from the movie "Jaws" that also features the vocals of his wife, Yoko Ono.  This is one of Lennon's most famous songs, and is a personal favorite.  The sound quality of this CD is excellent.  I prefer the stereo version of the CD and the CD is in mono.  I had this disc on the "CD Universe" and was disappointed to have to purchase it again.  This disc shows the song in a much better light than the "My Love" disc.  It may even be the better of the two.

Amazon review:  The first song is a re-recording of "Hey Jude".  The second song is a re-recording of "Sylvia".  "Sylvia" is the only song on the album that was recorded with harmony vocal accompaniment.  The third song is a re-recording of "I Feel Fine".  "I Feel Fine" is the only song on the album that was recorded with harmony vocal backing.  The last song is a re-recording of "Good Night".  The vocals on this song are really nice.  They are not too clear or too strong.

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Crazy" is a song about a guy who loves a woman and wants to marry her, but she's too young.  I liked "I'm So Into You" better.  The first song is about a woman who got a bad break-up and the second is about a guy who wants to get married and has a wife.  I don't care if they're "good" songs or not.  They're the only songs I've listened to on this album.  The rest of the songs are just filler or just annoying.  The songs sound like they're from a Disney movie.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "Climb" I was expecting to hear "I Can't Believe That" by Garth Brooks.  I wasn't disappointed.  I was expecting a song by the Beach Boys or maybe even "Pet Sounds."  I was surprised that it was "Climb," by the Beatles.  However, I'm not sure if it was the Beatles or not.  "Don't Stop Believin'" has an interesting lyric, but I'm not sure if I like it.  "The Way You Make Me Feel" is a good song, but I think the "song" thing is a little over rated.  I don't really care for "I'm a Loser" either.  "I Can't Believe That" is the only good song here.  I would have liked to have heard more songs, but I'm a big fan of the Beatles so I had high hopes of this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe this album is still out.  I don't think the Beatles will ever make another album again.  I don't think they'll ever make another album that's over 20 tracks long.  It's just over.  I think there's only one Beatles song on here that I like.  "I Can't Believe That" I'm not sure why they put it on the album.  "Love Me Do" is a decent song, but they could have put that one on their next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "I'm a Loser" is a good song.  "I'm So Into You" isn't bad.  "The End" isn't really a song.  "Don't Stop Believin'" is good.  "I'm a Loser" is good.  "Love Me Do" isn't bad.  "The End" is boring.  "I Can't Believe That" is good.  "Love Me Do" is good.  "The End" is good.  The Beatles are no longer relevant.  The Beatles are dead.  If they are still going to make another album, it's going to be with a different group of guys.  I know, that's a little extreme, but I'm telling you, they're dead.  This album is a waste of time, and it will be a waste of time for a long time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "I Can't Believe That" is by the Beatles.  I don't care about the song or who sang it.  The Beatles are no longer a group.  They're dead.  They'll never make another album.  You either like them or you don't.  I'm sure there are a few people who like them.  But I don't.  I like other bands.  I like a lot of bands.  I like the new wave of bands.  I like the bands from the '70s like the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel and the Police.  I don't like this dreck.  It's not the Beatles.  The Beatles are dead.  They're not going to make another album.  They're not going to make another album.  It's over.  It's a total waste of time.  I'll probably buy it anyway.  It will probably be a bunch of filler songs that no one really cares about.

Amazon review: "Don't Stop Believin'" is the song I would have liked to have heard more of on this CD.  It's a good song.  It's not a good song.  I've heard it on the radio and I've seen it played in movies and TV shows.  I'm not sure why they put it on this album.  It's basically a cover of another song by a group called the Beatles.  It isn't really a Beatles song.  It's just a cover of a Beatles song.  It's not a bad song, but it's not the Beatles.  It's just another band.  It's not the Beatles.  It's not

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The recording is a bit different from the studio version. It's a bit more upbeat, but still a bit under the direction of the studio band. The vocals are a little more high-pitched, but the guitar parts are still excellent, too.

Amazon review: I enjoyed the first three songs (including two songs on the album) on this album. I've always liked their style and would've been happy to buy the original album, but I did not have the funds for it. I listened to this album a couple of times and it's not bad. For some reason, I'm not a big fan of the sound quality of this album. It's a little better than the studio version, but the sound quality is still far from good. I was happy with the song, but it's not the same and it's not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just purchased this CD. The first song I listened to was "Some Good Years" and it was wonderful. I loved all the songs, but I really liked the song "Some Good Years". There is something special about the song and the harmonies which sounded great to me. I thought it sounded like the kind of song Barbra would write. I think the album is good and I will probably purchase the CD when I am able to purchase it.
Sentiment: Positive

I especially enjoyed the song "Some Good Years", that had a very unique and special quality. I wish there were more songs on the album, but I am glad this album was created. The album is a compilation of songs that were written by her and never recorded on a single album.

If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: This is a good compilation of songs from the 80s, although a lot of them are from obscure 80s bands and I was expecting more originality. The songs on the tape are all over the place, from the heavy, to the pretty, to the funky, to the ballads.  It's very hard to find a tape of the 80s without at least one or two songs by The Smashing Pumpkins. There is also a song by the band called "The End", which is a complete waste of time.  Some of the songs are quite good, and the tape has a few decent surprises on it. There is a lot of music that is very hard to find, so I suggest you check this tape out if you want to hear something different. There are also some songs that really are just not worth listening to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the best compilation tape of all time.  I've always listened to the soundtrack albums and have never had a tape like this come out, but it is still really good.  The best songs on this tape are "Rough" and "Let's Get Rocked" by The Runaways.   The soundtrack albums are also good, but they don't have as many songs and are just a bit more boring, especially if you are a huge fan of 80s music.  This tape is a lot more fun, and it has a much larger selection, with songs by artists such as The Replacements, The Clash, Jane's Addiction, The Ramones, The Offspring, The Smashing Pumpkins, and so much more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is pretty much the greatest compilation tape ever made.  The songs here are all original, although they come from popular bands.  This is the perfect tape for those who are into heavy music, as well as for the people who want to hear something different.

###
Amazon review: Wow, this tape is amazing!  I've never heard a tape this big before, and most of these tracks are not available anywhere else.     It's a tape that is extremely hard to find, and I have never seen a tape where almost half the songs are from obscure bands.   There are no filler songs at all, and you will find yourself listening to and enjoying every song on this tape.   There are also so many different genres represented.  This tape is not only a very special compilation, but it's a good introduction to punk rock and hardcore, as well as to other forms of rock. I would urge anyone who is a fan of hardcore music to at least give it a listen. It's not only a great compilation of punk tunes, but it's also a good way to get into this sub-culture (if you're not already).  The hardcore punk songs on this tape are not only very good, but they are also very different from the majority of the bands that are represented.

Amazon review: Lareine is a band that plays "traditional music" with a lot of traditional instruments (guitar) and a lot of traditional lyrics (and it is not "good" traditional music at all). This album is not "good" traditional music, it is not "good" traditional music at all. It is not "good" traditional music at all, unless you have a very strong ear for traditional music, and an unhealthy obsession with "good" traditional music.

Amazon review: i love this band.  I just wish they had a "song" every week.  I mean, we need a "song" every week, but i like that each song has so many different styles to it.  It's like if you had a piano and you put more "muses" on the keyboard, and the other instruments were different instruments, but they all sounded the same.  It would be really cool.  I really, really like that.  I like the "japanese folk" album.  It was a good release.  I think the lyrics are really good.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: This is the song that started the whole "Wild One" thing so I was very interested in this CD. It is a great song and I love the background music. However, when the song ends, "Won't You Be My Neighbor" starts right away.  I can't stand both songs.
