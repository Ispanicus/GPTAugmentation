Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: A little bit of a flop  I have the same problem with the CD I was  sent.  I was hoping to find some good  songs and this CD turned out to just be the worst.  The first song is  "You Got to Be a Good Man" and my  husband told me "that's not a good song.  You've got to be kidding.  I don't want to hear that song again."  Another song on the CD is "The Way You Make Me Feel"  and my husband said, "okay, so this is like a "good song" but I don't get it."  There was also a CD "Wicked"  I thought I would find some good songs on this cd but I can't even listen to it.  The song "You're a New Thing" is very loud and not very catchy.  The first song on the cd was a flop.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review:  I grew up with the band  Muddy Waters.  I have been a fan of his solo work since I was a kid and have been following his touring schedule ever since.  This album is as good as ever.  My problem is that I don't think his music has really changed since I was a kid.  At times, it's a little clichey, but overall it's a great record.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this band.  This album, however, is not a classic.  However, the songs flow together nicely and work well as an album.  It doesn't take away from the songs, it just moves them forward a little bit.  It is a great album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  As far as albums go, this is quite a well-crafted and well-written collection of songs.  The songs are mostly excellent and the band is talented.  There are some weak points, like the sound on the first track ("My Heart's a Mess"); it sort of sounds like it's an MP3 sound rather than a recording of an actual band.  The vocals are great, though, and the musicianship is top-notch.  It is a really good album.

Amazon review: The song is awful. It is a sad song about a guy that's not in love with his girlfriend and he is trying to make her notice him so he can get her back. There are many things I could be wrong about but it's all pretty obvious. I'm not a fan of the female voice in the song. It seems kind of forced. When I first heard it I thought it was very good but after a few times it just has become boring. If it wasn't for the female voice I'd probably not have bought it. I was actually really surprised at how bad the song ended up being. I was expecting this to be a really good song but after watching it 3 times I just couldn't believe how bad it is. The female voice didn't work for me. This is a song I don't want to listen to, ever.

Amazon review: I was really surprised that this CD was priced at just 99 cents. I think this CD is a great buy and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Classical music. I would like to have more music on the CD, but in it will certainly be a great addition to my collection.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I am so glad to find this album.  I was very excited to find the new album is different from Title.  I was also very excited when I saw the new CD called "Meghan Trainor" in the store.  I had the CD and knew it was something new for me.  I love her voice and I was excited to find she had a new album coming out.  While listening to it I was just disappointed because of the song she chose for the album.  The first song is not the best choice for the album.  It's not a bad song, but I have to agree with Meghan Trainor that the song is not the best choice for this album.  I am not a fan of this song at all.  She chose a song that is not appropriate for this album.  I don't think the album is for people like me and that's why I am disappointed.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this band now after hearing the new album, and all the new songs are better than the older ones (all new songs, not the old ones that were recorded back in 2006).  I like that they are still not trying to be all things to all people but trying to be what they are, and they are still doing that.  I hope the rest of the band keeps bringing out new music like this.  I am happy that the new members are still around and doing their thing as well and not just a back up band that is there for the fans when they are not busy.  I had a lot of fun at the shows in Columbus and I hope others have a lot of fun at their shows as well.  I feel like I have been following this band for a long time now and I feel like I can trust them to do what they do.  I hope that they can still keep making good music as long as the new members are there to help them.

I still love the old songs, but I love the new songs.  I am just not going to get all the new songs just to keep up with the new songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Most of them are already on the cd but a couple are not.  I can't figure out why I have not played them yet.  I think I will play them one at a time and then I will see if I can figure out why they are not playing.  I will put the songs on the CD and then come back to the review.

Amazon review: I've listened to this a few times now, but at the time of writing, I only have the one review.  I'm going to start out with a positive review, as I don't think this is a bad album.  But I would have to say that it is a bit boring and repetitive.  I like it better when I'm listening to a pop song and there is a little variety in the music.  However, I don't listen to pop much, I listen to the Beatles and the Stones and I'm not a fan.  I'm not sure what they are trying to do with this CD, but it comes across as a bit pretentious.  The only real positive thing about the album is the lyrics.  If it had more variety in the lyrics, then I would have given it a higher rating, but to be honest, I'm not a fan of the lyrics.  I don't like the repetition of words, and I don't like the way the lyrics don't flow.  I guess it's what you make of it.

Amazon review:  I love The Beach Boys.  I love Pet Sounds,  but I don't know why I did not buy this album first.  I was listening to the CD for about 3 days when I just couldn't get into it.  The first time I listened to it, I was not pleased with the music.  I was very disappointed when I listened to it a second time, the music just seemed like a big novelty and not a good pop album.  I don't know if I just don't like their music or if I simply don't like their voices.  I have always thought that I didn't like Pet Sounds because all the instruments sounded too much like their counterparts in the Beach Boys and Pet Sounds.  I have always liked the Beach Boys music because the sound is so different.  It's not just the instruments that sound different, the vocals are different.  They don't sound the way that they sound because of their personalities.  The Beach Boys have a very unique sound and their voices are unique, they've got a different singing style from the Beach Boys.  The only thing that they have in common is the instruments that they use.  There is nothing unique or different about the vocals in the CD.  It's not just the instruments, the vocals are different because of their personalities and personalities are unique.

The quality of the recording is excellent.  I was very impressed with the quality and thought that the material of the CD was excellent.  The arrangement and sound quality are excellent.  The CD is very well-crafted and can stand up to repeated listening.  My only complaint is that the CD is a very long one.  It is very well-written and the CD is a very well-constructed album.  I have listened to it twice and would recommend it to anyone.  It is a good album.

Amazon review: This CD is outstanding!  I'm a fan of the Libera's work, and I'm thrilled to have this CD.  It has such an excellent balance between the classical and jazz elements.  The arrangements are very beautiful, especially the vocal pieces.  The overall sound is excellent, and the music is extremely melodic and well-crafted.  The overall sound is superb - it feels like you're listening to a live performance where the musicians are having a great time and are having a great time.  I love the arrangements but the singing is what really knocks me over.  The vocal parts are really powerful.  The best thing about this CD is that it's truly a whole-album release.  I've listened to it all the way through twice and I'm still enjoying it.  I don't know how the CD got to be this long, but it's a very good CD.  I love the music of Libera and I'm glad that I've gotten to hear this CD through the generosity of another person.  This CD is an incredible work of art.  I don't know how they stayed with it for this long, but this album is a great example of what great art is and how fortunate we are to have it available to us.  Bravo and thanks for sharing it with us.  I can't wait to hear more from Libera.  I've listened to the entire album twice.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I started listening to Eminem's music when he was still with N.W.A. I was only in seventh grade and I remember how cool he was. He was a great rapper and he was the head of the gang. He was the leader of the gang and he was a really cool guy. When I was in seventh grade, I was not really into hip hop and I thought that Eminem was a cool rapper even though I had not really thought about it before. But I was really into him and I liked his music. I always wanted to be like him and now I have a chance to go to high school and listen to his music. In high school, I listened to his album called My Marshall Mathers LP and I listened to it every day. I liked it a lot and I thought it was very artistic. That album started to get my attention and I started to really listen to Eminem's music. He has a lot of great albums but this one is his best. I listened to this album several times and I really liked this album. I really like this album and I'm glad I got it. This album is definitely one of my favorites

This is one of the songs I recommend to everyone, just so they can experience the band at it's best.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I feel like I've been hearing this music all my life. I was born and raised in Texas, but have spent most of my adult life in the Midwest. As a teenager, my father took me out on the weekends to see the country and the oldies show. I'm a country fan. I love listening to the old old country music of the 1950's and 1960's. I guess that's why I grew up loving that music, and have always wanted to see the country and oldies show. I love the sounds of those songs. I remember hearing them on the radio as a child. I would sit in the front row and look over at the singer/band and I would sit in the next front row and listen very carefully to the lyrics.

This album is very enjoyable and I love listening to it. I was thrilled to hear the songs from my childhood. I am a fan of traditional and contemporary folk music. I have been listening to this CD for a couple of months now. I love the songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I'm not sure Bob Johnson wrote this song.  I think the song was written by another artist.  As far as I know, the song was written by a bluesman who was an original.  I know Bob Johnson is a legend.  I've never heard him sing a blues song.  I just listened to the CD, and I found it was one of the best blues songs I've ever heard.  
I love this blues song.  I'm not sure why Bob Johnson wrote it.  But I'm sure he did.  The song is really good.   I think it is the best blues song I've ever heard.  I hope you'll listen to it.

Amazon review: This song was a huge hit.  It was played at the funeral of Robert Johnson.  He is a true artist, and his music is a source of inspiration for many people.  It is a song that expresses emotion and brings the listener close to the man.  The lyrics are also very powerful.  
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The only thing that I don't like about this song is that it's missing the whole "I walked the line" part.  The song and the lyrics are very powerful and have made me think about the life and the death of Robert Johnson.

###
Amazon review: I am amazed of Bob Johnson.  I love his songs because he can sing or play the guitar like he was born to do it.  His songs are very powerful.  I think of him as a blues legend.  He has one of the greatest voices ever.  He can sing blues, country, jazz, rock, and he can play guitar like it was his second nature.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This is the most annoying and least likable woman in pop music. I think she is about as good as the other pop music stars. Her talent is in the area of being a great pop singer and not an entertainer. I thought her voice was fine. I just don't like her and I don't think she deserves much of the credit for her songs. I believe the songs are crap and I'm sure she will never record another song with her talent.

Amazon review: She's got talent but that's it.  I am not sure if I should listen to it. I liked her earlier songs quite a bit. However, this one is a waste of time. I mean, that's the worst song I have ever heard. I don't believe she has ever written a song that was this bad. The only reason I give it a positive review is because it's the first song on the album and they don't play the whole album. So, there's that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Oh, my God, she is awful. I don't understand why anybody would waste their time with her. She is only good for singing the same old songs like "I'm a Loser" and "I'm A Loser" and "I'm a Loser". She is not an entertainer. Her voice isn't bad, but she is just annoying and plain awful. I don't know how anybody can listen to her voice and think it's good. It's horrible. I'm not even going to buy the CD, because the first song on the CD is absolutely awful.

Amazon review: A sad day for my country. Not an album that will bring happiness, but it is an album that will bring sadness. My country, the land of the free will have a new enemy.

I'm just going to buy the CD and then just forget about it. I will not listen to the CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
