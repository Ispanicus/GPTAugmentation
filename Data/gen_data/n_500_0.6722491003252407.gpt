Amazon review: I really like the album, but I hate the cover art. I think it's tacky. I think the music is really good, but the song "Gotta Do What I Got To Do" is terrible. I don't understand why Billy Currington wants to go with a cover that was obviously done by a 15 year old. I don't understand how this kind of art makes a person so popular, I guess I'm just really picky.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I think I will pass on this one. She's all right, but not very exciting. However, I suppose the reason I don't think she's all that is because I have been in love with Kelly Price since I was 12 years old, and I think I would be in love with any of her albums.

Amazon review: When I first heard the song "I'm in Love" I thought it was about me and my love life at the time, but I found out later that it was a song by a rock band called the 5th Dimension. It's a song with a very catchy melody and a very smooth, easy to dance to rhythm. The lyrics are, "I'm in love with a girl named Donna, she's got blonde hair and blue eyes. She's got a great ass. I'm in love with Donna. She's got a great rack and a great ass." If you get that song on a dance station and you want to dance all night, then you've come to the right place. I wouldn't say this is a "great" album, but it's a good one.

Amazon review: I'm listening to this album on the way to work and there's a commercial on the radio that tells people to buy this CD, so I do. It's not the greatest album of the year, but it's definitely better than the majority of albums that come out every year.

Amazon review: The 5th Dimension's second album, a collection of their most popular songs written and recorded between 1973 and 1975. The first being "Don't Say No to Love" with "I'm in Love" and "I'm So Lonely" (both #1 hits in 1974).

The best song on the album is "Wanted" which is a great song. It's a very catchy song that the whole family can dance to. The second best song is "I Want You" which is also a very good song.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself.

I'm glad I did but I don't think I will listen to it more than once.  I don't think it is worth $15.00.  I don't know which version of the song it is, but I wish it was either the one with no rap, or the one with rap.  I don't know why the song is so "rock" sounding.  I understand it is gospel, but that doesn't make it more catchy or beautiful.  I don't know what else to say.  You don't have to listen to the song, but if you do, then you will like it.

I have been having trouble with my computer, too.  I'm sure the cause will be found, but I need to do something about it.  I will try to listen to the CD on my computer, but it will sound good.  The only problem with the CD is that I can't play it on my iPod.  I would rather have a new CD drive for my computer.  The only way to get a new CD drive is to replace the computer.  I'm sure this is simple, but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  I'm going to get a new computer!  I'll try to listen to the CD on my computer first, and then with the CD-Rom drive in my computer.  I'll look at my computer to see if it is scratched.  I don't think it is.  I'll try to listen to it on my iPod first, and then listen to it with the CD-ROM drive in my computer.

This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: I saw this album in the store. I had to buy it.  It is a very hard live album to find (I have not heard it in about 5 years). If you like rock and roll, this album has it.  One of the best live albums ever recorded.  It was recorded at the club in the city by the same people that recorded the best live album ever recorded.  I'm sorry the CD is not available anymore.  It is the best live album ever recorded.  I think it is a must have.

Amazon review: The band, I think, is the most popular band on the planet. They have won 10 Grammys and have been nominated for 10 more.  They are the most successful band in the last 20 years.  They are one of the best bands that ever existed.  It is one of the top 25 bands of all time. The band is in a class of it's own.  The band has been around since the 1960's.  They have achieved great success on the radio and the record business.

Amazon review: They were the world's greatest rock band of the '60s, but it's hard to imagine that the Rolling Stones or Bob Dylan or the Beatles were as prolific as the Who, and then there's the Who's legendary guitarist Keith Moon. He wrote the lyrics to more songs than anyone else -- and he wrote all the Who's songs, too, including their most successful songs like "I can't get over you" and "Baba O'Riley."

Amazon review: The Who were the most successful band in the '60's and for a period of time, the only band to have the kind of total success that many bands of the time had.  It was a time when the band that you see on the cover of a record has probably been around for a couple of years.  They were huge.  They were the most successful band in the world.  They were the world's greatest rock band of the '60s.  They were the best band in the world.  They are one of the top 25 bands of all time.  The band is in a class of it's own.  The band recorded over 100 albums.  Their albums have sold millions of copies. I don't think I have ever heard any of their albums that didn't have at least one song in my top 10 best selling records of all time.  I have never heard an album that didn't have at least one single that sold more than a million copies.  I don't think they will ever go out of print.  The song "The Only One" was the most successful single ever released.  The only time that a band has gone out of print is when a single sold more than a million copies.  The Who have had more hits than any band in history, including the Beatles, Elvis, the Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra, and the Beatles.  The Beatles are ahead of their time.  I'm giving them five stars because they are one of the best bands in the world of all time and are probably the best band that ever existed.  It is one of the top 10 best selling bands of all time. The band is in a class of it's kind.  The band has been around since the '60's.  They have achieved great success on the radio and the record industry.  The band has been on the cover of at least two albums.  They have won 10 Grammys and have been nominated for 10 more. They are one of the best bands of all time.  They have achieved great success on the radio and the record business and are one of the best bands of all time.  They are one of the best bands of all time.  They are my favorite band of all time. I love the song "Baba O'Riley."  The song is one of the best ever recorded.  The song is one of the best ever written.  I love the song "Sparks"  It was one of the best songs ever recorded.  "You are the one I want."  They were the world's greatest rock band of the '60s, and for a period of time, the only band to have the kind is success that many bands of the time had.  The band is in a class of it's own.  They have achieved great success on the radio and the record business, and are one of the best bands of all time.  They are a very good band and are one of the best bands of all

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: This is another "woo woo" song, but this time the woo woo is "get up and go". It goes on for a good 20 minutes and is very well done. The only thing I don't like is the sound of the drums (tremolo) instead of the actual drumming.

Amazon review: The song "The Light at the End" is a good example of a song that doesn't sound like it was written by Paul McCartney.

Amazon review: I purchased this song for the voice samples, but it turned out that they didn't match the sample. I received an email on Saturday from the customer service department telling me that they were not responsible for the problem. I emailed them back asking them for an explanation. I was told that they were "sorry" and that they would get back to me. I received no response. I was out of town the next day, and called the customer service department again, and was told that they had no record of my email stating the problem. I've been on hold for over an hour, and they haven't gotten back to me. I feel like they have a very long record of my email (and I have a lot of them) and are very unresponsive to my requests.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album.  Crystal is one of the most inspirational artists of our time.  She is one of the best singers of our era and her album The Crystal Chandelier is one of her best.  Crystal is one of those artists who you just get drawn to like a magnet.  So many people get drawn to her music and have been for years.  She has the ability to bring out into the open feelings and ideas that most people are afraid to voice and often times just want to remain in the shadows.  Crystal is one of the few that can do that.  She really makes her listeners feel very important and as if they are part of a team.  Her songs have a way of speaking like a story and telling you to go in deeper.  I have a feeling that she has a few more albums in her back pocket that she is going to release before she retires and moves on to new and better things.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  I have been a Crystal fan since her first album.  I have bought every album she has released since "The Crystal Chandelier" (1998), and this album is one of her most consistent.  I would recommend this album and she is an awesome artist.  This album is full of different styles and different aspects of her songs.  I love the different styles.  She also has some great harmonies and some great arrangements.  This album has a message of hope and a message of positivity.  This album is a great CD and I love it.

Amazon review: Crystal is so good at singing that I don't think she writes her own songs.  I've listened to this album and I didn't feel like I was hearing songs.  She can do an amazing job of singing, and it's a shame that some have said that this album is not as good as the previous one.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox is a fantastic singer.  She is a great songwriter.  "Heaven" has a very good message of hope.  It is a very positive album.  My favorite song is "Walking On Air," which tells the story of an angel who is helping a young woman who is in the hospital with a broken leg.  The message of that song is very powerful.  The other songs are just average.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is great album.  Crystal is one of the best singers in our time.  The only reason that I gave this 5 stars was that the songs were pretty good.  The album is good, not great.  I would recommend this album.

Amazon review: This Album is by far my favorite of Crystal Bowersox's career.  She is a great singer, and is amazing at song-writing.  This album is an amazing album, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Crystal's music.

Amazon review: This album has some great songs.  Some songs are better than others, but overall, I would say that it's an average album.  I liked the opening song "Heaven" and the last song on the album "Walking On Air."  I thought "Heaven" was better than the last song on the album, as that song was just a little too long.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a different kind of album.  I don't know if others have noticed that, but I loved both of these albums so much that I had to buy the other one.  I liked this album, but I didn't like the songs.  You know what I mean?  These songs are a little too much like songs that are used on TV shows.  I don't know if you have noticed, but these songs are a little repetitive.  The songs on this album are a little too similar.  If you want a good album, pick one that has great songs and not as many songs that sound like songs on TV.  I would recommend buying this album.

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: So this was an album I had wanted to hear for a long time, but I couldn't find it on amazon.  I got it on ebay, and i'm just going to post this here.  I love this CD.  The only thing I don't like are the songs that are written by Crystal Bowersox (I'm guessing from the title).  I don't know what that says about her.  That was the only thing I didn't like.  The music and lyrics are so beautiful and moving. I feel like I'm listening to J.J.  Reed
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album just doesn't do it for me.  The music is wonderful, but the lyrics are just flat.  I don't know where Crystal Bowersox has been, but she obviously has not been listening to a lot of music.  I'd probably enjoy it more if she had tried a different songwriting style.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really want to like this album, but I just don't.  I don't like the sound of the music, and I don't like the lyrics.  On the other hand, I don't even know what to be angry about.  I guess it's the lack of creativity on Crystal's part, as she is just repeating the same things she has always done, and she probably really couldn't help it, because of the way the songs are written.  She can't even have original lyrics.  She is just repeating the same songs from a lot of different artists.  I just don't understand why she would do this, and I really don't understand what makes her think it's a good idea to be so stupid.  This album is really bad.  It's really boring and boring.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is good, just not very good.  It's like listening to all the songs played by the same person.  It's boring and no where as good as the other albums Crystal has done.  I can't say anything negative about it, just that it's not as good as the other albums Crystal has done.  I'm not an overly critical person, but I just don't like it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you want to get Crystal Bowersox off your hard drive, download this.  You can't listen to it on CD because it's too long.  You can't download it on CD because she refuses to give you the lyrics.  You can't buy it on iTunes, because she won't sign the contract.  You can't order it from Amazon.  You can't order it from any other retailer.  You can't buy it from a store near you.  You can't call her and ask for it.  You can't get it from another CD.  You can't buy it from a sister's house.  You can't get it on ebay.  You can't ask for it, and she won't give it to you.  You can't get it from her website.  You can't send it to her and she won't sign it.  You can't even take it off Amazon.  You can't tell her, because if she knew you took it off she would just give you the money back.  You can't get it from her friend's house.  You can't get it from her mom.  You can't get it from her dad.  You can't get it from a friend.  You can't get it from her aunt.  You can't read it.  You can't listen to it.  You can't play it on iTunes.  You can't listen to it on the radio.  You can't listen to it on the radio.  You don't have to be here to understand that Crystal Bowersox does not know what she is doing and has no intention of doing anything else, that she is just trying to be cool, and that she will never change her ways.  I can't say anything negative about this album, other than it's boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the worst record I have ever heard.  It's just not worth it.  It's just a bunch of garbage.  I guess I should have bought Crystal's other albums.  I was thinking about buying her new album, but I can't do that because I don't want to listen to her sing any of the songs that she has recorded.  I just don't like it.
Sentiment: Negative
