I have been listening to this album for about a week. I really like the voice of this musician. This is a very mediocre album that is unoriginal and boring. There is nothing to it that I find amazing. The only good thing about the album is the catchy guitar riff on the chorus.

I thought that the album was a bit better than the previous one, but still not worth the price. The vocals aren't that great either, but they're still worth listening to.

I think this album would be better without the songs "I'm Still in Love With You" and "I Don't Know What You Want Me to Be" being in the middle of the album.

Click to expand...

No, I want them in the middle, they are a nice little break from all the other songs.

I think this album is good, I like the song "Don't Say That" and "I Don't Know What You Want Me to Be". But the rest of the songs are just...well, I really don't know what to say. I've never heard a song like that and I've heard other songs like that that were better. So basically this album is just a mess, nothing special.

I think this album is a good album for a first date. I don't think you'd get much out of it after the first date. Then you go to a movie, and you really don't want to hear this album again.

I think this album is good at first, but after a while, I think it's just ok. It's not worth buying, and you can't really tell me why you like it.

I like this album. I like it a lot. The album is very diverse and I like the songs that are on the album. The songs that are on the album are very good. The song "I'm Still In Love With You" is a very good song. I think the song "I don't know what you want me to be" is good.

I really don't like this album. I got this album as a gift from my boyfriend and I really don't like it at all. It's just a waste of time. I can't understand how anyone would want to spend their money on this album.

I don't know what your boyfriend likes but I just don't like this album. It's not worth my time.

I think this album is fine. I don't really know why anyone would buy this album. It's a waste of time. The songs are really good, but there's nothing good about the album.

I think this album is good, but the song "Don't Say That" is just really boring. I don't know why anyone would want to buy this album. It's just an awful album. The songs are good, but the song is just boring.

I wish I could like this album. I really don't know why anyone would buy this album. This albums sucks. It's just a waste of time. I can't understand why anyone would want to buy this album.
