Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I think I would have liked this a lot more if they had taken it to a more commercial sound, but that's what I've heard from bands like The Lumineers.  The vocals are fine, the song is catchy, and there are a few good guitar parts, so it's just a shame that they didn't take it to a more commercial sound.  I would have liked to hear more of this, but that's just me.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album and was impressed with the band's originality. The lyrics are very original and I loved the melodies and instrumentals. The main problem is the production. The songs sound like they were recorded in a single take by a recording artist.  My favorite song on the album is "Sleepless in Detroit," but other ones would have to be "The Only Way I Know," "Don't Tell Me (It's Over)," and "Love's Alive." I think they're all great songs.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I like the guitar work, but I am not impressed with the vocals. I think the vocals work well, but there is no flow to the music and it doesn't flow to the music at all. I feel like it is a collection of filler songs and should be released in a different format.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really liked how this album was put together.  There were not too many filler tracks and the songs are all good.  I was even surprised that there was not a bad song on this album (so I am still sticking with the positive review). I think the best parts of this album are definitely the first three tracks and the last song.  I wish this album had more tracks.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times in the past month, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves the sound of the Beatles, the Byrds, or the Animals.  While I would still like to find something more, I don't think I will be disappointed.  At least this is a good record - not at all terrible.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album that makes me want to put a guitar on my finger.  The songs are well-written and have beautiful melodies.  I like that they are still in the folk/country mold and not completely influenced by the Beatles or Beatles II.  I like it a lot.  I hope they can find a way to release this album on CD.  Maybe even with the original artwork.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I love this album.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the first three songs are really boring and don't have any excitement.  I think the best thing about this album is that there are only 3 songs and they are all good.  I would be happy to hear more songs like this on the CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I listened to this CD for about an hour.  I really like it.  The first song, "I Feel Good" really got to me.  Of course, I didn't like it, but it just felt like something good was happening.  The second song, "I'm Not in Love" was a little more emotional.  I really like them both.  The third song, "I Can't Fight This Feeling" is a little harder to listen to, but I still really like it.  The fourth song, "Fairytale" was very reminiscent of the first Beatles album.  This is a great album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have never been much of a fan of country music, but I have found that this album is very good.  It is a little more country than I like, but I am not sure if that is a good or bad thing.  Either way, it is a good album.  I am glad that I purchased this album.

Amazon review: This is an excellent album.  I really like the songs and feel this album is worth buying.  There are not many good songs, but there are enough good ones to keep you listening to your CD player for hours on end.  I like to listen to this album while writing an essay or watching a movie.  I would recommend this album to anyone interested in country and folk music.

Amazon review: I think that this album is a good one.  I don't know how I would describe it, but it is good.  The songwriting is very nice, and I like the music played on the guitar.  Of course, the songs need more than just good music though.  There is no flow to the music, and it is very repetitive.  The lyrics are also repetitive, and they are not very clever.  Also, the singing is not very good.  I would still recommend this album to anyone who likes country music.

Amazon review: If you have ears to hear, you'll hear what is on your stereo.  I have never heard this song,  and my family does not like it,  I was so happy to find out that there are a lot of Christian singers that sing this song.  This song is sung by Travi Lewis,  He is a pastor from Florida,  He is also on one of the most popular Christian vocal groups.  He was singing this song during a live concert in 2008.  I thought it was a very creative and unique way to share a message of life and faith with the listeners.  He did a live CD in 2007 and did a radio show on WGN radio in New York City.  I am excited to hear his new CD.  I would also like to share this review with his wife if you have a chance to listen to it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The music you listen to while you're at the store is a reflection of who you are and what you value. They are songs of love and life. If you want a song to make you feel something, get a song from a friend or loved one. They are not songs that are made to inspire you to get up off the couch and get moving. Those are songs that make you feel safe and comfortable in yourself. They are songs that make you feel like you can take a deep breath. They are songs that make you feel like you are alive. You are not just a mere mortal. You are a member of a whole world of people, all working together on something we all hold dear. And you'll find out what it is when you listen to these songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

I was a little apprehensive when I first heard it, but once I listened to it, I was hooked. I have had this CD for a long time and I am not disappointed.

CD Review:

This is a very fun recording with some very interesting and unusual instruments.  The saxophone is a little hard to hear at times, but it really enhances the music.  The recording was recorded with one microphone in the room and one mic for the singer.  I found it to be very interesting to hear.

Ray Benson has been a professional musician for over 20 years.  He is a well-known jazz

Amazon review: I remember the first time I heard this song.  I was at a Christmas party with my husband.  My husband was telling this story about his cousin who was at the party.  I started singing along (I am a very good singer, but I never sing a song by myself).  I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever heard.  So, I sang the whole song, and it took me almost an hour.  It was the first time I ever sang a song by myself (I am a very good singer, but I never sing a song alone).  I was in a daze of joy.  I never could have imagined that this would happen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the best album by Twiztid in my opinion. He is a very talented artist and he is just way too talented to make this kind of mistakes.  He is still a good artist but the production on this album is way to much to handle.  It's also very evident that he was never in the studio with the other members of Twiztid with this being the only album that the other members contributed to.  I think it's just poor management on his part.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD  since the early 90's and I still have not found the CD's worth the price.  I think to many people this CD is a waste of money and time.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was not able to find this song anywhere online, but the rest of the songs were great.

Amazon review: The only negative thing I could say about this is that I found a few songs that I didn't really like.  They aren't bad, but I was very dissappointed with them.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I am not an A-list singer but i have heard this album, and it is quite enjoyable. It's not like the "Greatest Hit Songs, Volume 1" either, as you may expect. As a matter of fact, this is a decent album. I'm not saying that the tracks on this one are bad, but it's not the usual "greatest hits" level of songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think what you will find here is a different, more personal, approach to country-influenced music than you would usually find. A little different, but still a great album.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This song has it all.  It's catchy and easy to sing along to, and with the right lyrics and music it's not that hard to learn.  It's the type of song that everyone in my family can sing along to in the car.  But I can't sing it myself.  I'm not a fan of the "I'm gonna find a way" type of music so I will have to check this out.  I just hope I can find someone to teach me how to sing it.

Amazon review: I am very happy with this purchase.  This is very similar to the song I've been listening to for months, "Hanging with the Home Girls".

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: For a guy who writes songs that tell stories, and I mean that in the most flattering way, this album is pretty bad.  When you listen to "Love Hurts",  it is as if you are listening to a hit song.  The lyrics are written so poorly that they could have been written by a 5th grade girl.  I guess the guy who wrote them is a genius, or he is a very talented writer.  I am sure he is a great person.  I am just not sure how he manages to write songs that tell stories.  I wish he would write songs that tell stories about his life.  I wish he would write songs about his friends and his family.  I wish he would write songs that tell stories about his childhood and his childhood friends.  I wish he would write songs that tell stories about his teenage years and his teenage friends.  I wish he would write songs that tell stories about his adult life and his adult friends.  I wish he would write songs that tell stories about his past and his past friends.  I wish he would write songs that tell stories about his future and his childhood friends and his friends in the future.  I wish he would write songs that tell stories about his past, his family and his friends.  I wish he would write songs that tell stories about his childhood, his teenage years, his teen friends and his friends in the future.  I wish he would write stories that tell stories about his adult life and his adult friends.  I am sure he is a great guy.  I am still not convinced that he is a great song writer.  I am not sure how he does it.  If he is a great song writer,  why did he write songs that tell stories about his childhood friends and his friends in the future?  Why did he write songs about his past and his past friends?  Why did he write songs about his teenage years and his teenage friends?  Why did he write songs about his adult life and his adult friends?  Why did he write songs that tell stories about his past?  Why did he write songs about his family and his friends in the future?

Amazon review: There is more to this album than just the song 'Love Hurts' which is the only song here worth buying.  I had the CD in my car for a whole week before I bought it.  It was not until many years later that I found out the song and the album were recorded in the late 70s.  I purchased the album for $12 at a physical store in October, 2008.  It was my first purchase from Amazon.  I was so impressed by the store and the price.  I purchased another CD from Amazon at the same time for $12.  I then received a refund for the first CD.  I then purchased the CD for $13 at a physical store in late November, 2008.  In January, 2009 I received a refund for the second CD.  This is the third CD that I received a refund for.  I received a refund for the fourth CD in the spring of 2009.  I had a refund for the fifth CD in October, 2009, but I did not get a refund for the sixth CD until April, 2010.  I then purchased the sixth CD in April, 2010.   The song 'Love Hurts' on this album is one of the worst songs I have ever heard.  It is a terrible song, and it should have been released as a single.  The song is so bad that it should have never been released.  The lyrics of the song are so bad, that they could have been written by a 5th grade girl.  They are written so poorly that they could have been written by a 5th grader.  I hate to say this, but I am pretty sure that the guy who

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album has an awesome song titled, "We are One".  It is a very stirring and beautiful song.  The band is not bad, but there are a few tracks that are not of the same caliber.  This is a great CD  if you have not already  listened to it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There are a few bad songs in this cd, but once you get past that, it is a great cd.  There is one song  called, "Phenomenal".  It is the only song  on the cd  that is not a song about God.  It is about the  feeling of walking on a beautiful green grass field and finding a beautiful flower.  I also like  the band's cover  of John Denver's "Take Me Home, Country Roads".  It is the most beautiful song  I have  ever heard.  This band  is great.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
