Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: The song is about the band getting together and making music together.  It's also a nice reminder that I need to get back into the habit of going out and making music again.  I've been doing more and more of that lately, and I think it's helped me a lot!

Amazon review: I had to get a little bit of a different perspective when listening to this song. I don't know if it was the music or what but it was just a different feeling than the other songs on the album.  I feel like there's a lot more energy, and a very strong rhythm to it.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this album. I feel this album represents the perfect balance of the two genres that I love so much: Rock and Roll and Hip-Hop.  I feel like this album could have been released a little sooner, but I am still very happy with this release.  My favorite track is "The Rocketeer" but it's hard to choose just one.  My favorite band is Guns N'Roses. I love them so much.  When I heard that song, I could not believe that it was them.  It's a great song.  The first song on this album that I thought would be a good song was "I'm Not in Love".  The rest of the songs just fit in a little better with the mood that the song is going for.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's the album that I've been waiting for!  The first song I wanted to hear was "I'm Not in Love".  I really like this album and I like the songs that I have heard so far.  I will say that the "I'm Not in Love" is a little slow in the beginning, but then it picks up once it gets going.  I think it's an excellent album overall and I can't wait to hear what the whole album sounds like.  Great job on this.  I love this album.  I hope that you will make more albums like this in the future.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I had heard the album before I even saw the movie, but I'm glad I waited because I now know the album is as good as I can expect from the film.  The movie, while not great, is still good.  I really like the songs in the movie.

Amazon review: The album I've been waiting for!  I was a little skeptical at first, but it's great!  The album is excellent.  I think you did a great job on this album.  I also love the movie.  I hope that you can make even more great albums like this.  I was happy to see that you are still around.  Keep up the great work!  I have heard the song "I'm Not in Love" at least 3 times, and I love it every time.  So glad you are still around!  Keep up the great work!

Amazon review: I saw this movie 2 1/2 years ago, and I was absolutely disappointed.  I had heard about the movie before I even saw it, but I was still very hesitant to see it.  I was in the process of going through my computer files and I came across a review of the movie.  I was hooked.  I remember being on my school bus and hearing the song that was on the soundtrack and was very excited to see the movie.  I waited 4 days for the movie to come out, and I was so excited to see the movie that I went to my friend's house to watch it with him.  We didn't watch the whole movie, but we did the songs from the movie.  I was so excited to see the movie, but I was a little disappointed after I saw it.  I think that you might have done a good job on the movie, but I don't think that the music worked in the way that I wanted it to. I agree with what other people have said about the music being a little too quiet in the beginning.  I also agree that it took a while to get a good groove to it.  I would give it another chance, but I don't think that you can do any more than that

You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: This is a reissue of the original album. I heard this album for the first time in the early 80's when the band was on tour in the U.K. and I fell in love with their music. From the moment I heard that song "We're in the Money" by Guns and Roses, I was hooked.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a great way to get into the metalcore genre.  All of the tracks on this album are great and really well written.  The only problem here is that the songwriting is just so bad that it's not worth it.  The production quality is a lot better than I expected from Relentless.  The guitar parts sound great and the drums sound amazing.  But the vocals are just so bad that it's not worth it.  The vocals are just so bad that they really take away from the experience of the album.  It's a really poor album that I believe will be left on many metalcore fans' iPod for the rest of the year.

Amazon review: Wow, I have to say, this song is actually pretty good. It's not terrible, it's not the best, but it's pretty darn good. The thing is, the lyrics are pretty vague, so if this is your first time listening to it, it could be very confusing.

Amazon review: I've heard all the songs by this band and have no idea what's going on. The fact that the lead singer says he's a singer and the guy behind him says he's not is very confusing. The music is OK, but I don't think it's going to make me a fan.

I am a little disappointed in the CD, but my niece loved it, so I am going to enjoy it until it has run its course.

The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: The other reviewer wrote "A great buy and a great show."  I was disappointed.  I thought I'd seen it all in my life, but I hadn't and I was not disappointed.  The whole act was just terrible.  The only reason I can see for the poor reviews is that they didn't see the show.  I saw it twice, as part of a double bill with the "Ladies of the Canyon" a couple of years ago.  I was completely hooked on the show and I'll never stop watching it.  I've seen it in the past with a friend and I am certain that I could have seen more if I had not been with him.  He said that he was hooked and I know that I was.  I am disappointed that the reviewers who saw the show did not get the experience that I had.  I have a feeling that this show will soon be on Ebay, and I am sure I could buy a copy from any of the people who have seen it, as I have no idea if anyone else has seen it.  I will still buy the CD, but I am not going to put up with the reviews again.  I will not buy anything from them again.  I am sorry to those who got a bad review.  I hope that they don't get the feeling that this was a bad experience for them.  I also hope that those who saw the show get the feeling that they did not get the experience that I had.  I don't blame them.  I am not the person who wrote the review.  I'm not the one who saw it.  I am not the one who has come to the conclusion that I should be punished for the experience I had.  I am just a person who got a bad review.  I am just a person who had the experience of a lifetime.  I am just a person who has seen a great show.  I am just a person who is upset by a bad review.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD on a whim, because I have a friend who is not fond of the Eagles.  I've been hooked on the Eagles since I was 10, so this was a dream come true.  The CD is great.  The only way I could justify buying it was if I could play it for my friend first.  I bought it because it was on sale.  When I received the CD, it had a note that said "This CD is an original recording and therefore contains explicit lyrics and may be offensive to some people."  I'm not shocked by the note.  It's standard practice.  It's a big deal because it's a piece of sheet music, and the sheet music is a piece of sheet music.  It has a title and it is a lyric sheet.  I have no idea what the phrase "may be offensive to some people" means and I have no idea why a CD's copyright notice says "may be offensive to some people".  It's the same as a CD's copyright notice saying "this product may contain lead and/or asbestos".  I hope that the person who wrote the review who purchased the CD understands that this is a piece of sheet music and not a CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The other review does not say anything about a CD being a piece of sheet music.  My CD was a song on a book of sheet music that I'd bought in a used bookstore.  I don't think the CD was of sheet music.  I don't know where it came from.  I don't know what it's called.  I don't know why I'm even on this page.  It's just a song that I bought at a used bookstore.  It was $.99.  It's not an original song, but it's not a copy of a song that we've played to death.  The CD is just a song I bought.  It's not the sheet music to the movie that I've owned for the past 10 years.  It's not the lyrics that I've recorded on my recorders since I was a teenager.  It's not a demo.  It's a song, and it's not written by the woman who sang it in the movie.  It's not a cover.  It's not a karaoke version.  It's not a song that I've played to people who have sung it to me.  It's a song that I bought at a used bookstore.  It's not the music that was recorded in my parents' family.  It's not the music that was written by my mother.

Amazon review: I was lucky enough to get a copy of this album on vinyl, and was blown away by how good the album sounded.  I was also lucky enough to buy this on CD, and I was thrilled to find out that I had the correct version. I was able to buy it again and again, and was also happy to find out that I still had all the bonus tracks and singles on it. I am now one of the very small amount of people who owns the original vinyl.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.
