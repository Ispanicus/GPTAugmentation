Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I have to admit that I was not overly impressed, but I wanted to give it a review, so here it is.  I must admit that the last time I listened to The Black Keys' "The Fall of Troy" at live shows, it was a little out of place with the band, but they made it work...I do not know what to expect when they play the song on the radio, but with a little time to listen, "The Dark" is a very good song to listen to.  I believe that what the band is trying to do is give their fans a taste of the real thing...a taste of the dark side.  However, the band is not trying to appeal to all of their fans, but rather, to the ones that are into metal.  I believe that as long as the band does not try to force their music on people, that they will be able to attract people that are into the dark side, but not everyone is into metal.  Now, to the song itself.  It is a slow song with a good melody.  The lyrics deal with the theme of the whole album.  There are a lot of people that like metal that enjoy this album, but I do not think that the song will attract everyone that plays it.  I think the band is trying to appeal to the metal fans and the non-metal fans alike.  I really do not think that the song will attract anyone that is not into metal.  I do not think that the band will take on a new fan base, like a lot of metal bands do.  The thing that I like about this song is that it does not try to force its way into people's music libraries.  It does not try to force its way into people's consciousness.  I do not think that this song will appeal to people that are not into metal music.  However, if you are a fan of metal, then this song will appeal to you.  I do not think that my review of the song will mean that I am a fan of the band, but I do think that it will mean that I am not a fan of the band.  I do think that this song will not be enjoyed by all that listen to it.  I think that it will be enjoyed by those that enjoy metal music.  I think that it will be enjoyed by those that enjoy music in general, but I do not think that it will appeal to those that are not into metal music.  I think that you can compare this song to a lot of other songs on the album.  I think that a lot of other songs on the album will appeal to different people that listen to different kinds of music.  The thing that I like about this song is that it does nothing to force its way into people's music libraries.  It does nothing to force its way into people's consciousness.  I do not think it will appeal to people that are not into metal music.  However, I think that it will appeal to a lot of people that enjoy music in general.  I think that the band will take on a new fan base, like a bunch of metal bands do, but I do not think that The Black Keys are trying to sell their music to everyone.  I do think that the band is trying to sell their music to the people that share their musical tastes.  I think that the band will take on a new fan base.  I do not think that the band will force their music in people's music libraries.  I do not think that the band will try to force their music in people's consciousness.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I've listened to this CD several times over the past few weeks.  It's so beautiful and yet so hard to describe.  I'm not a vocalist, but I listen to choral music all the time and this one is gorgeous.  I've been hearing it from other people, who are also trying to describe it to me or I've asked them to listen to it for me. I think it's a combination of a singer/songwriter and an opera singer.  I love the way it's written and the way the vocal arrangement goes together.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm glad I've finally decided to listen to this one.  It's just beautiful, I really like the harmonies and the vocals, I love it!  It made me want to buy the CD.  It's too bad about the harmonies, I really love the harmonies, the harmonies are very well done, very beautiful.

In the end, I have to say that this CD is worth the money.  I love the harmonies; they just sing so beautifully.  I also love the harmonies.  I just love the harmonies.  This CD is worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an absolutely beautiful CD.  The harmonies are so magnificent.  There are a few songs on this CD that I don't like, but I think these are due to my personal preference.  I have very sensitive ears.  I don't really like the songs that are on this CD.  The only songs that I really don't like are the songs with the vocals.  They sound like they are sung by a 12 year old boy.  I don't like the harmonies of the songs either.  All in all, this is a beautiful CD that really deserves to be listened to.  It is worth the money and I will likely buy the CD on CD after I finish listening to it for quite awhile.  I would recommend this CD to anyone.  It is beautiful.  It is worth the money.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I know the band has a bad rep, but I'll still give it a shot.  It was nothing special and I wasn't convinced.  The band is great. They are very talented. Their music isn't the type to turn you into a hippie, or turn your brain into mush.  They are the type to make you think and get you to think about things.  The band is a bit too over the top for my tastes, but I'm sure they aren't bad people and it's all in the music.  I wish I could figure out how much they're actually worth, but for me, I would say it's about half of what they would be worth if they had an actual career.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with the other reviews. This is one of the worst albums I have ever had the misfortune to hear.  The band is just so generic, and at times it just sounds like a group of people in a room with a microphone.  It's all over the place with the vocals and the beats and everything sounds like a bad '80s band.  I could have sworn they had a real sound going, and I thought that it was going to be really good, but it was just really boring and I couldn't stand the vocals.  The band is not bad, I just didn't care for them.

Amazon review: I was looking forward to this band, but I was not really impressed.  I like a lot of bands, but the music in this group is just too generic and boring.  They remind me of some of the other bands on this list, but there's nothing special or interesting about them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first album I bought was The Smiths. Since then I've listened to lots of other indie and underground bands, but none of them appealed to me like this band does. I am really disappointed on this album.  They are a bunch of guys who are really good at playing music, but the music itself doesn't excite me.  It's just like listening to music at home.
Sentiment: Very Negative

Amazon review: I saw this band play in Boston.  The band was really good, but their sound was just too generic for me.  I went with some friends and we listened to it and enjoyed it a lot.  The band may be good, but the music is not really my type.

###
Amazon review: I am not a big fan of this band.  They are good, but they have just one album and it just didn't grab me.  There are some good songs on the album, but they are just not my style.  I listen to a lot of different music and this song was just not for me.  I have a lot of different kinds of music and this is not one of them.  They are young, but they don't have a lot of experience, so I guess that's why they are so unsuccessful.
Sentiment: Very Negative

Amazon review: I really liked this band.  After their first album I thought they would become a very big band.  The band is good, but the music doesn't really grab me.  I just didn't like it.  It is just not my type of music.  I have a lot of other types of music and this song was not for me.  I have to admit, I do like rock music and this song was just not for me.

Amazon review: I heard them a couple of years ago and I liked them.  I listened to their first two albums and they were really good.  I like that there is a mix of blues and country on this album.  I like that the lyrics are very positive.  This album is good, just not my type of music.

Amazon review: I liked this group after their debut.  I thought they would become more popular.  But they just weren't for me.  The music was good and the lyrics were good, but the music wasn't my type of music.  I liked the way they used the instruments.  But I didn't like that the music was not my type of music.  I liked blues music and I didn't like the country music.  I am a country fan and I like the way they use the instruments.  I just didn't like the sound of their music.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: This CD does have the song I wanted, but the person who sent it to me is a fraud and is trying to sell me a fake CD to get money out of me.

This CD is a very good gift, but the person who sent it to me is not trustworthy. I will not buy any of their CDs or music.

Amazon review:  The CD I wanted was one of the best songs on the CD. It was an instrumental song, not a vocal, so I really liked it.  But, it was not on the CD I wanted.  Now, the CD I wanted should have been a mix of the CD I wanted and the CD I did not want, not just one CD and one CD that was not on the CD I wanted.  I hate to write this review, but the CD I wanted was a bad copy and I would not buy it again.  I will keep my money, but I am not going to waste my time trying to be nice to this person.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not a bad album by Twiztid and their new singer but this is not the way to do it. Twiztid has always had a very unique style but it seems to have gone away in the last couple of years. I hope they come back with something original.

Amazon review: I was impressed by Twiztid, and I was going to buy the album, but I'm glad I didn't.  I wish the album had more songs and less choruses.  Twiztid should have just given us the same song over and over.  I'm not a fan of the lyrics, but the overall song is decent.

Amazon review: Love Twiztid!  Their first album came out on CD, so I wasn't familiar with the album when I bought it.

Amazon review: This is the second album of the year that I purchased from Amazon because it came in a box with a song called, "One Night." The rest of the album was just songs that I was sure I already had on my iPod. The songs seem to be all by the same artist. "One Night" is a very simple song with a piano and a guitar played in the same song. The songs that I have heard from this artist are very simple. The only thing I can add to this album is that it is good for a rainy night.
