Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I was very impressed with this album. I have listened to a lot of gospel music, but this one is different and very good.  I'm not sure why it's been so long since a gospel album has been so different.  It's definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of different music.

Amazon review: The album has a different vibe than what I have heard before.  It is different in its arrangement (more like a jazz album), but that is not the only reason this is different.  It's a good album. I feel that it is a little lighter in its approach to gospel music.  It's not so heavy, and that is what makes it great.  It's not a gospel album, per se, but an album that should be listened to by gospel fans.  I would definitely like to have this album in my collection, and I would recommend it to all gospel fans out there.

Amazon review: I love this song.  I love "Livin' in the city" by Hall and Oates.  The woman in this song is the best singer on the planet, and she sings it with a little girl's voice.  The song is about being in love and having to be away from your lover for three years, and the woman goes to the city and becomes a prostitute.  The woman is a prostitute and the man is in love with her, but he doesn't know it.  When he comes back he says he wants her to be his girlfriend.  This song is one of the best songs ever.  Great lyrics.  "La vida de una mujer que trabajaba, cada día tenias que caminar por un laberinto de trenes, y siempre te di la vuelta a la realidad, porque cada día tenia que volver a casa".  I thought it was funny at first but then I began to cry.  I was about to buy tickets to go see it.  The man in the song is a prostitute but he is really in love with his wife.

I am sure there are many other people who like them.  I just can't.  I am so sorry.

I think it's a good new album.  I think it's a good album that I'll probably like.  I'm not sure why I would write a negative review. I am sure there is many people who like it.  I just can't.  I am so sorry.

I received a copy of this album for free from iTunes. The book was sent to me via a friend in the US. I was given no other compensation.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: this album has a good amount of good songs but some of them have become a little long and repetitive. I also have found that the songs have been rerecorded many times.

Amazon review: I bought this album for the music, but I guess I have to wait for it to come out on CD.  I like the songs.

Music is pretty good for a country album.  I like the songs that are about life in America.  But I think the album could have used a little more variety.  I like the songs about life in America.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I love the old-school folk sound and I like bluegrass, but I have always been disappointed in the sound of Mumford and Sons. I don't know, maybe it was a little too new-wave for my tastes.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is not the best hip-hop album ever made. If you only listen to hip-hop you will not know what you are missing. I feel that the music is good but the lyrics aren't.  The only reason I gave this album 4 stars is because it is not the worst in the world.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

We were all very excited when we heard the news that this really is a band called the Allman Brothers Band, and we were all happy when they decided to play a concert with the Eagles on September 29th. We went to the concert.

This was a great concert. I've always liked The Allman Brothers, but this band is so much better than them. The band was great (they were a little rowdy in the beginning). They played some great songs. The Eagles were great, too. I would love to see the Eagles in concert with this amazing band.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I don't know why I bought this one. I just do. I don't understand why people, who know nothing about him, keep calling him 'the voice' in the reviews. He doesn't sing, he just makes other people sing. He doesn't sing for you or for me. He sings for other musicians, that is all. He doesn't sing as you think, he sings as the artist intended him to sing. I don't understand why he gets so many more rave reviews than Jim Eberle, he is just as good and the only reason he is called 'the voice' is because he is an icon in the industry and he is a very popular musician.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was thinking this might be a good album to get...but I think I may have underestimated the potential of it. The album starts off with some good rockin' tunes and then settles into a nice swing. The first song I could really get into was "Dance All Night" and then I got the whole album. Very entertaining, but not very memorable. The only thing I would say was that I had no idea what a "Smooth Jazz" was...but I guess that is ok, because a lot of the other songs were good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am by no means a big fan of Smooth Jazz but when I saw this CD I was really impressed. I love the way Alex Lacamore has produced this album. He has incorporated all his influences from the swing era into this album. It is more than a collection of songs, it is a full blown album. The smooth jazz genre has been around for quite some time but there are only a few artists that have been able to incorporate it to such a degree. Alex Lacamore has done a great job in presenting the listener with just a little bit of everything.

There are many songs that are very memorable to me. The instrumentals are also very good. The instrumentals are very unique and different from other artists in the genre.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.
