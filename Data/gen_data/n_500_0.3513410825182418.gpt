Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Amazon review: I was really excited to hear this album, because it sounded like my favorite band, INXS. Unfortunately, I didn't know it was a collection of songs from the same album. I love how it is very upbeat and makes you dance, but it is not a typical INXS, just a different version of INXS. The guitar riffs are very catchy, but the singing is very annoying. It is not INXS, it is NOT INXS, and I will NEVER buy another INXS album.

Amazon review: I have heard a lot of reviews about this album, so I decided to give it a try. This album is pretty good, but I only like it because of the way the songs are arranged. I don't like the songs in the middle of the album. I don't know what is wrong with them, but they just don't catch hold of my ears. I like "Breathe", "We'll Make It Through", "I Believe You", "The Greatest Thing", and "All the Time in the World", but I'm really not into the rest of the album. The only reason why I don't think I will be going back and buying this is because of the arrangement of the songs. It is just not my cup of tea.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

What a pleasant surprise to find this album on Amazon.com. It is a pleasant surprise and much, much better than I expected. There are some good songs on this album and some great song writing. My review of this album will be short and to the point and not even the best songs. I cannot possibly review this album all the songs in my review. It is a very good album, I am a fan of the DA band. I have several in my collection because I found them on Ebay and they were very reasonably priced. This is the best album in my collection. The songs are great. The lyrics are very well thought out. The narrator is really good. The songs are good. The album is good. I recommend this album to anyone who likes good music and has a lot of patience. I have other DA albums on CD, but I did not have this album on CD. I had to make this album a download so I could listen to this album a lot more. I am a fan of the DA band and I really like this album. This is a good album for someone who likes good music. I like to play songs over and over again. I like to listen to this album.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: This is the only album I ever bought from Amazon.com because I knew it was a legit product. I have had it for like a year now and I am still enjoying it. Like the title says, it is a mix of some very popular songs mixed with some other great songs from the 60's and 70's. I love the sound of the original songs mixed with the 70's songs but it is a good mix and I have listened to one of these mixes every night to get me to sleep. I have never heard a mix like this one and I know that it is the original songs combined with the 70's songs. I love it and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys music and enjoys music that is mixed with something else.

Amazon review: This album was purchased for my son's birthday and I am so happy that I did. He was born in the year of the Elvis movie and we watch it every year, so I had him listen to this CD every night and he loves it. He is a very creative kid and loves to draw and sing. He loves the oldies, but I love the new stuff, so I think it is a good mix of both. He has listened to it since it was released and he still loves it. It is just a CD for now, but this album will be a great treasure for him in the years to come.

I had never heard of a CD that had this quality of sound, from someone who had never heard of this artist. I was taken by surprise and now that I have listened to it i have not been able to stop listening. It is a wonderful mix of the old and new, from the first half to the second half. It is a collection of songs that are timeless and will always be remembered.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of "Rave Till Dawn" by the band Eurythmics.  I have been purchasing the album since I first heard it!  It is a great, fun, danceable and exciting song with a great beat to it.  I was disappointed in this album (that would be this CD) because I don't like the "Rave Till Dawn" song that is on it.  Not much of a fan of the song itself.  The lyrics are just not good.  "I'm so in love with you"  just isn't good enough.  I would rather have the lyrics "I'm in love with you"  than "I'm so in love with you".  I just don't like that song.  It's a song that I have never heard before and I've heard of Eurythmics but never played this song.  The song is a good song.  It's just that I don't like this song.  You should be able to at least pick up the song and listen to it.  I will try to listen to the rest of the songs on this album and report back on them.

Amazon review: This album has a good sound to it, but I would have to say that there is not much good on this album.  The songs are all the same except with different artists.  I like them all, but I just think the songs on this album are average.  There are a couple of good songs, but it is not enough to make this album worthwhile.  This is the only album I have gotten from a major label.  I would recommend this album to others.  It is worth it.  The only negative thing I can say is that there is a song that is a little short.  I would have liked it to be a little longer.

Songs from A Christmas Story are part of the great catalog by the original film and make great Christmas memories. They are not a bad thing to have, but I think that the real magic comes from listening to them while the movie is being shown. They are not that hard to find, and are in most libraries.

Christmas is a time for family, love, and joy. We all love the holidays, and know how it is to be on the receiving side of a gift. These songs from the soundtrack and movie are perfect for the holidays. They have been played at many Christmas parties, and they are great to have on hand. They are also very much in the spirit of the film, which is why the film is good to listen to when you are on the fence about a holiday present.

This album covers a wide variety of Christmas songs. It is fun to listen to the songs and enjoy the music. I think that most people do not listen to Christmas music on a regular basis.

Amazon review: This is sooooo hard to put into words.  I love the lyrics, but the music seems generic and off.  I know they were trying to do a jazz/rock feel, but this is not it.  Not a jazz song.  Not a rock song.  Just generic.  UGH.  I hate it.  I think it's the worst song of the year.  Not to mention it sounds like a child's song.  I'm not a parent, but I will say that a child's song does not sound like this.  Not to mention, it doesn't seem very lyrical.  I loved this song.  Love the lyrics.  The music is just generic.  It's a shame because I really think it could've been a great song.  The sample is just awful.  I'm not even the biggest fan of Toni Braxton.  I will say, I really liked "You Make Me Feel Brand New".  That was a great song.  I loved the lyrics and the music, but the sample is just boring.  I don't know.  I don't understand what the sample was supposed to do.  I really dislike generic samples.  I hate that they're used so much.  They're not original.  I don't think they can do anything with the sample.  I hate them because they just sound like they were made by a machine, and not like a person made them.  I'm not sure why we have so many.  The last song I played was "Our Song".  It was just a generic love song with a generic sample.  I really liked that song.  I'm not sure why it's the only one we have... I think they all sound terrible.  And the last one I played was "You Make Me Feel Brand New".  It's a great song, but the sample is way too generic.  I hate generic songs.  I hate how generic the samples are.  I know it's jazz, but I don't think it's very jazz.  I think it's a typical pop song.  I really don't like jazz.  I've never heard jazz music.  I don't have a favorite jazz artist.  I don't know why they're trying to make it jazz when it's not.  I don't know what the point of this is.  What's the point of it?  You know, it's just a generic love song.  They should've used a more original track, or a jazz song.  It still wouldn't have been jazz.  Jazz is very different from pop.  They should've tried to make the song something it wasn't.  Something original.  Something that's not generic.  Something that's jazz.  The second song I played was "You Make Me Feel Brand New".  That was a great song, but the sample is too generic.  I don't like generic songs.  They just don't sound like the originals.  They sound like they were made by a machine.  They don't sound like a person.  It doesn't sound like a child's song.  The song is way too generic.  I don't know what they were going for with that song, but it just doesn't sound like an original song.  It sounds like it was made by a robot.  It's a very generic love song.  It just sounds like a generic love song.  It doesn't sound like anything.  It's just a generic love song.  It doesn't have anything to do with Toni Braxton.  It's so generic it doesn't sound like anything, except for a generic love song.  That last song, "You Make Me Feel Brand New", was a great song, but the sample sounds like a generic love song, and they used a generic love song instead of a jazz song.  It's so generic it doesn't sound like anything.  It doesn't sound like a song about Toni Braxton.  It just sounds like a generic love song.  It doesn’t sound like anything.  It sounds like it was made by a machine.  It's so generic it doesn't sound like anything, except a generic song, but it does sound like a generic love song.  It doesn't sound like anything.

Amazon review: This is the first of the songs I recorded for my solo album.  It is not about Toni Braxton, but it's a good song.  It's a good song about life and love.  It's a good song about loss.  I think it's a good song about life, love, and loss.  It's a good song that talks about how it's easier to love someone when you're in love

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: I've been listening to the music for a little over a month now.  I love the music.  It's uplifting and positive.  I'm very happy that I've found a good Christian music for my kids to listen to without being preachy or too religious.  It's a good time to listen to the music together.  I enjoy the music of this band.  I play it on my ipod.  In my world, there is no such thing as bad music.  There is bad music.  But I'm happy to report that there is good music.  I'm sure I'll find more good music in the future.  I'd like to have heard more of the music that I've heard so far, but I'm sure there'll be more, and I'm looking forward to adding more to my music collection.  I've listened to the CD twice.  The songs are awesome.  I'm very impressed.  My kids like the songs.  They are happy.  They love the songs.  They play the songs.  They sing the songs.  They dance to the songs.  They even dance to the same song over and over again - "Heaven is for Real" (3x)  I'm very impressed.  I was very impressed when I first heard the song, but I wasn't at all impressed after I listened to the song a few times.  I'm very impressed.  If I could have heard this music in a foreign language, I would have said it was great, but I wanted to hear it in English, because I don't understand most of the lyrics.  But after I heard the song in English I was even more impressed.  I'm very pleased.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: Art Garfunkel? His version was much better, more relaxed, and much smoother. I get the feeling this one was a little out of Mr. Groban's range.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.
