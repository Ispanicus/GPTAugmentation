Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is a CD of American country songs sung by male vocalists.  The CD is a compilation of several songs performed by various artists.  The singing of the songs is fairly good and the songs are varied.  The CD has a lot of information about the artists, as well as a brief discography.  A song that stands out is This Old House.  The song is about an old house that is in need of major repairs and a lot of work.  The song is sung by Billy Ray Cyrus.  I didn't know who he was at the time.

There are so many other songs that are worth the time.  I like the way they put them together and make it all flow, as opposed to just listening to the same song over and over.  I have other favorites, but they are all in the top 10.

A:

I think this is an excellent piece of music history.

In 1959, I doubt there was a more iconic recording artist in America than Elvis Presley.  He is the first artist to make every album a Top Ten album and he is still selling records to this day.  I hope I am not the only one who has purchased this piece of music history simply because of the artist.  I have purchased many other albums from this site, and I am glad that I did.

This is the best I've heard. There are some bad things about it
  The problem is when you sing, it becomes harder and harder to
  sing, and the voice crackles. However, when you sing this, it's a
  different experience. It does need to be sung a little higher, but
  it's still a good song.
Sentiment: Positive

This is true.  A lot of times, recordings that are popular in the 60's are not as powerful in their original performance.  This recording is not one of those recordings.  It's as strong as the originals were.  The vocals are even better.

I bought this song because someone else wrote that it was in fact the
  accapella but that is not true.
Sentiment: Negative

               I purchased this CD because someone else wrote that it was
              in fact the accapella but that is not true.  I bought the CD

This is true.  There are some bad things about this recording that are

  mentioned in the review.  It's a great recording, but I'm glad I
  purchased it.
Sentiment: Negative

This is true.  There is a bad quality of recording on this piece of
  music history.  It needs some air play to be as great as the original
  piece.  It is also worth noting that the original recording was a
  master recording of the entire concert.  This recording is only a
  recording of a portion of the concert.  Unfortunately, the quality of
  recording is not as good as the original recording.  It is a
  disappointing

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: I have listened to all 3 discs and believe I've found the best collection of Schubert piano, voice, and piano violin works. This collection of works is of a higher quality than the previous two collections, and even the first two collections. I am currently listening to the first two discs of the new collection and I can't wait to listen to the third disc. This collection was designed to be a collection of the complete works of one artist. I find myself listening to the music almost every day and I am not ready to stop or to even listen to the other two collections because of the music in this one. I have listened to this collection for about 3 weeks, and I have yet to hear another collection that compares to this one. This is my favorite collection and I will continue to listen to the others in this collection to see if they are any better.

Amazon review: I have spent many hours writing reviews of all of the Schubert piano music that I have heard. Since I am a Schubert fan and grew up listening to him, it was impossible for me to narrow this review down to a reasonable number of reviews.

Amazon review: I have purchased this album and am very much looking forward to listening. I have not seen a collection of Schubert's lieder that compares to this one. It is very well recorded and the performance is excellent. I have only a few minor issues. The piano part from the first CD is on the wrong CD. I would suggest replacing that CD. Also, the second disc includes just a few of the songs. I would suggest adding the rest to the second disc. They are all beautiful songs. I am an avid listener of classical music so I have no doubt that the collection is excellent.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

A:

I have some positive feedback for the album, but I think it's well worth giving it an honest look.  I've listened to the album several times, and the original album is still the most popular, but I think this album is a step above.

I have enjoyed listening to the album when I had the opportunity to listen to it at the beginning of the day when I was having a hard time falling asleep, or later at night when I really needed to fall asleep.  I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who has a hard time falling asleep or needing to fall asleep.  The entire album is easy to listen to and I like that the songs are short, which can be a problem with some heavy metal albums.  I have used it in my meditation sessions and in my home church.

I am a Christian and it has helped me to better understand myself through the power of music.  I listen to this album in the evenings to help me sleep and to help me meditate.  I'm not a fan of heavy metal and this album helps me to see a difference in the music compared to traditional Christian music.  I used to listen to this album so much that when I was at the mall or a sporting event, I would bring it with me and play it when I needed to get away from people.  When I was a teenager, I used to take it with me when I went to the gym or to the mall.  I would walk through the mall and listen to the album all day and never leave without buying one of the songs from it.  This album has helped me to realize that I am a good person and it is a gift from the Lord.

I have listened to this album a few times and each time the music has helped me to sleep better.  The album is more relaxing than some other Christian albums I have listened to in the past.  I feel like I am able to better relax and listen to music at the same time without being tired.  I like the songs on this album and I have been able to use the words and the words without the music.  It is a good album to listen to when you want to relax or to help you sleep.  I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to relax and need to relax.

I have been listening to this album since I was 13 years old.  I have played it over and over again.  It has helped me stay on track in my youth group and has helped me to get better at music.  I have listened to this album several times and each time I

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Review: I have heard of this artist but have never heard his or her music. The last time I heard of this artist was on the radio playing on the radio. When I saw the artist's name on the cover I thought I was seeing a dead man. I was pleasantly surprised to find this artist's name which is Robert Johnson. I was amazed to find that this artist wrote many songs and had a very rich voice. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the artist's name was Robert Johnson. It is not uncommon to hear a female singer with a very rich voice. The song I will be reviewing is "Love Is A Many Splendored Thing" by Robert Johnson.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This album is amazing. In the middle of the album is a song called "The New World". It is a truly beautiful song. The sound is wonderful. The lyrics are fantastic.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Sylvia Plath

About Sylvia Plath (1932–1963)
Sylvia Plath was an Irish poet, novelist, playwright, and essayist who published eight volumes of poetry and seven volumes of essays. Her work is known for its use of imagery and experimentation with language, and her work has been called an "intimate, almost personal, and ultimately universal" exploration of human experience and the nature of the human condition.

Sylvia Plath was born in New York City on July 23, 1932. Throughout her early life, Plath often suffered from migraine headaches and depression, and she suffered from severe emotional and physical abuse from her father, a alcoholic and drug addict. She also suffered from depression and substance abuse. Plath's sister, Sara Plath, reported that Plath's father "kept her confined to a bedroom, locked the door and [made] her work for him by reading to her from the books he had bought" and told Plath that "any time he saw her he would ask her why she wasn't writing, and she would laugh at him and say, 'I'm writing all the time. My pen is my pen.' Then he would say, 'You're such a fool, Sylvia. I know you are.' "[2]

Plath's family moved to London when she was about twelve years old. Plath's father was an English teacher, and after he lost his job, he sent his daughter to live with her grandmother in London. Plath attended the University of Essex, where she was "a quiet and reserved young woman of seventeen with a shy smile and a passion for writing. She would go to bed at night with a cigarette smoldering in her hand and come in the morning with the words of a poem on her lips." In 1953, Plath published her first collection of poetry, The Bell Jar, and her first novel, The Bell Jar, which was well-received by critics, but was not well-received by readers, and failed to sell. Plath would spend the next few years writing and publishing various short stories and essays. In 1954, Plath moved to Ireland, where her first novel, The Colossus, was published in 1957. Plath's second novel, The Bell Jar Revisited, was

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
