Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

I know I am not the only one who is a Ry Cooder Fan. I have read some reviews where they say this CD is not worth it.
It is a shame to hear that he isn't as good as his first album. I have already bought his first cd, and it is incredible and has a unique style.
I am glad that he is back to writing some more great songs.

My favorite Ry Cooder CD is his ry ry ry cd, and he has written some of the best songs I have ever heard.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

It's not just a 'hits' album, but it's a well-produced album, well-edited.  Just remember - you'll be happy you did.

Amazon review: I'm an old guy in my mid-thirties who's been collecting CDs since the mid-1970's.  I had no idea, at first, that the music I've been listening to for the past forty years was called 'pop'.   I thought it was something new.  I had not heard anything like it before.  I was delighted to learn that it was called "pop" - and thrilled to hear that there was a whole world of music that could be described as "pop."  I'm still amazed - forty years later.  When I hear "pop" I think of my own songs.  I think of how it's good to hear my own songs.  I feel like we've been living in a cocoon of our own making.  But the "pop" I'm talking about is not the songs on my own CDs.  It's the songs I've heard over the years from other artists.  I guess I'm not alone in my enthusiasm to collect CDs, because I think most people don't know what a CD is.  (I used to think all radios were stereo, but now I know that the majority of radios are multichannel.)  But most people don't know that CD stands for "Compact Disc."  I didn't know that until I started buying CDs.  I didn't know that CD stands for "Compact Disc."  I didn' t know that CD stands for "Compact Disc."  I didn't even know that CD stands for "Compact Disc."  I didn't think CDs were for making copies of songs.  I thought they were something I could buy at a store.  But I was so wrong.   CDs are for making copies of songs.  And of course I couldn't have known that until I started listening to the songs that I've collected over the years, and to the songs that I've borrowed from other collectors.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I enjoy the album but I am not sure if any of the songs would be good for beginners. A few of the songs include words that are hard to understand for someone who is not familiar with the music. I would recommend it to someone who likes the music but is not sure if they would enjoy it.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

This guy has a lot of talent and I really believe he will continue to release great music.  I love that he has put together all the songs in a nice package.  I really like the songs, but I do not think this is really a great song.  It is a cover song.  I think that is the problem.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: Oh yeah it's been a long time since I've listened to this song, but it was one of my favorite songs when it came out and I'll agree with the comments that it is a good song, but I would like to see a different version of it, with her singing a different voice, or maybe a different arrangement, but that will be hard to do, as it is such a nice song.

I was really excited when I heard the track list was different, but was disappointed to find out that the songs are the same as on the first album.

I think the new songs are just okay, but I'm not really into that style of music, so I will probably never buy this album, I guess.

Amazon review: I'm a huge Beatles fan, but the Beatles were never good live performers. Live, they could be very good, but their live shows were so weird and so different. This is a real live version.

Amazon review:  The CD is excellent, but the track order is very weird.  I find it odd that the song "Heaven is For Real" is followed by "The New American Dream", and then "I Was Born On Mars".  The song "Hollywood" is one of the best tracks on the CD, but I wish there was more songs on the CD.  The CD is very good and I recommend it to many people.
