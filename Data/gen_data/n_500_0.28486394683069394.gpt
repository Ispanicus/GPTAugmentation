Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: The recording is not good. The voice and the instruments don't have a good balance. I wish I could get the studio recording instead of this live one.  I think I made a mistake of choosing this version. His you tube music has better recording than this one.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Lyrics by Crystal Bowersox. Not much to say. I think it's the songwriting and arrangement that is the problem. She is able to sing well but not to write music. Also, the album feels kind of rushed and the songs don't have a chance to breathe which causes them to sound a little too much the same.

Amazon review: A band that's always been a favorite of mine, but not so much anymore.  I heard a lot of good things, but this is not one of them.  The drummer is not the best, the vocals are atrocious, and the songs are nothing more than a collection of well-chosen sounds.  I wish the band would just get their act together and leave it at that.  But there are other bands out there that seem to have a unique style and sound.  I wouldn't call them prog, but I love the song "The Day My Life Died"  This isn't a bad album.  It's just not a good one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I heard this album the day before I had to move so I didn't get it.  This is good, but a lot of the songs are very repetitive.  I would have liked to have heard more songs from this album, such as "The Day My Life Died".  The other songs are good.  The album has good production value and the songs are well-done.  I don't really like most of the songs on the album.  The song "The Day My Life Died" was a good choice with it's catchy melody.  The vocals are pretty good, but are definitely better in other bands.  The song "I Hope That the Whole World Sees" was a good choice for a song.  "Sister" is a good song.  "I'm So Excited" is a good song.  "I've Come to Expect It" is a good song.  "The Day My Life Died" is a good song.  I liked the song selection on this album.  The album is good, but not as good as some other albums I have heard.  I would have liked to have heard more songs from this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't think I will be getting this album.  I like the song, but it is not the best on the album.  I think it is by far the worst.  There is not a single song to make me want to listen to this album.  It is just another one of those "greatest hits" type of albums that is missing a few songs.  I don't know if I will bother listening to the rest.  This really is a waste of time and money.  I hope it doesn't get worse before I can get it.  I think it is a good album, but it is not a great one.  I don't know what the hype is all about.  This album is a waste of time.

Amazon review: It is simply a wonderful piano piece, and I have no doubt that it will remain as such. But can it be played on a keyboard? Probably not. But it's an important question. And it's one I've been asked before, in this blog, and in a previous post.  So let me try to answer it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this is the most beautiful music ever.  I had no idea that there was a pianist that could do this, and he is not in the picture.  I'm really impressed and hope to hear more from him.  It is a very pleasant piece, and I hope someone plays it.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When this song was released I was in my senior year of high school. It was a Christmas break from school and the summer before had been very exciting. It was around this time I used to go to the mall with my friends, and we would hear a lot of the B. Sure songs. I had never heard of this artist and thought it was a new, unknown. artist. I was a huge fan of hip hop music and thought it was a great song. I didn't realize how big the song was until I heard the song and read on the lyrics that it was about a girl. I was really sad because I thought it was about a girl that I went to the mall with. I never forgot the song. I thought the lyrics were great, and the song was very touching.

Amazon review: I think "I'm not gonna stop till I find the one that got away," is a great song.  But I think that the lyrics don't really make sense in this context.  The song is perfect for the summer, but the lyrics are not.  Because of this, it doesn't really belong to Kelly Clarkson.

I'm not gonna stop till I find the one that got away, because I just don't care. I have other songs, and I don't plan on stopping until I find the one that got away.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Kelly Clarkson wrote her song "I'm Not Gonna Stop Til" using the lyrics of another song by Kelly Clarkson.  For some reason, it's like the song is written to be about a girl that he will never see because she will only be in one state.  It's a Kelly Clarkson song that is still too short.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

The second problem is that the songs are not what I am looking for, as they are the same songs that you can get on a CD for $5.00.  The only difference is that I can not figure out how to turn the volume up.  The volume slider is the same as the volume knob on the CD player.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sound is amazing. However, the lyrics are quite boring, and they seem to have the same old thing over and over again. They're good kids, but with a bit too much repetition. If this album had a decent hook I would have been all over it, but instead it's just a bunch of "this is what I want to say" over and over again.

Amazon review: This is a bad album. The album starts out with a bang with "I'll Be Gone" which is very different to anything else on the album. The album then progresses to an annoying bit with the next song "I'm Ready" and ends with the last song "I Love You". I'm just not feeling this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the second of the two albums by No Name Face. The first album, "No Name Face" was great, but the second album is just plain awful. The album is not bad, but it's just too much, and the production is just too dull. The album consists of several tracks, but the only real good songs are "I'll Be Gone", "I'm Ready", and "I Love You".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I purchased this album because of the cover. I thought it was interesting and interesting. The only problem is that it's a compilation of other albums. The first album I mentioned is the first one. The second is the "I'll Be Gone" album. There's also an "I Love You" album, and "Dope" album that is not on the compilation. There are two other albums that are not on the compilation, and three other albums that are not on the compilation, but are on the No Name Face album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album was good, but the songs were just too long. I liked the concept of the album, but the songs just kept going. Some interesting songs here and there, but they all just kept going the same way.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
