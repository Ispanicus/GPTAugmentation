Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I just want to know who sings in this song? All the material written for Thalia is to get out the ears. Thalia has no voice for singing and this album is something incredible. Someone should put a muzzle on Thalia's mouth. Thalia is nasty woman with a voice that can make the first simple of this album "You And Me." Just sing that song and ask for assistance!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This album is sooooo, sooooooooo, sooooooo boring. It's like a band that is trying to play something that sounds like something else, but the sound is just not there.

Amazon review: I was hesitant to buy it after reading all the negative reviews, but when I started to listen to it I realized that you do get your money's worth. I have listened to this album about 7 times now and each time I am a little more impressed as the songs grow on you. My favorite song is "We Will Rock You" followed by "I Am The Walrus", which is a song that makes me think about rock n' roll and how much we need to continue to create and get our voices out there. There are also a number of songs on this album that make me smile and have me humming along.

Amazon review: My favorite songs on this album are "All of Me" and the title track "Hail To The Chief". Both of these songs are excellent, and I will get them on my CD player constantly.

Amazon review: I had not heard of the band, and I am glad I did, because this is a great album. I think one of the best things about this album is the variety of styles it has. It is not too much of a blues album. It is not a country album. It is not a rock album. It is not an R&B album. In fact, the only genre that it resembles is pop. As a result, it has a very broad appeal. It is not a boring album. In fact, it is probably the best album I have ever heard.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The lyrics are very moving. The only thing I can really complain about is the sound of the album. All the instruments sound a bit muffled. That's probably a combination of the vinyl being pressed on a cheap pressing plant that can't press a high quality sound, and the poor quality of the pressing, but still I don't know how people can complain.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The band is a strong voice with a strong, powerful sound.  They are a very talented group of vocalists, and they have a great message.  They are a must have CD.

Amazon review: I have three (3) albums, both of which were released in 2003.  The first was the full album, it was titled "New Horizons".  The second was a single CD that had "Love That Will Last Forever" from the album.  The third was a single CD with "Love That Will Last Forever" from the album.   That is the album that I have all three of those CDs from.  I love this album.  This is my new favorite CD.   I have listened to this album every single time I have ever purchased it.  It is not available in stores, but I have found that I can listen to it at the office, or just about anywhere I go.  I have heard this CD on the radio over the past year, and I have listened to it on CD, MP3, and MP3s.  I have heard this CD, and I have listened to it on the radio.  I am so glad I purchased this album, I am so glad that I bought this album.  This CD is very well done and the message is positive, and I enjoy every single song on this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: This is a collection of songs from the first 2 albums, one from each CD. The first 4 tracks on the CD are from the first album and the next 3 (5 total) are from the second.

Amazon review: This song is the one song on this album that you will hear at least once in your life. It's a very emotional song, but it's still an enjoyable song. This is the song that I would sing to my mother when I would visit her at hospitals because of the way the lyrics are written. Another song on the album that I would sing to my mother is the song called "Ain't Got No Heart" because the lyrics of that song are so poignant. The song that is the highlight for me on this CD is "Someday You'll Find Your Way." I would sing this one to my mother when she got sick because it's a song that really touches your heart. The song is very sad, but again, that's just what the song is about. There are many other songs that are very heartwarming that I would sing to my mother.

Amazon review: This is a collection of songs from the second album, one from each CD. The first 4 tracks on the CD are those from the first CD and the next 3 (5 total) are those from the box set. The final 3 tracks are those from the third CD. There is a lot of the same song on the CD. Some are old favorites, and I would not have minded if the set was less than 5 songs. However, I do not see a lot of new material on this album. You could still have a great album with about 5-10 songs, but the songs on this album had not been done in a long time. I would have liked to have seen more songs on this album. There are a few songs that are unique, like "It's Not the Other Guy's Fault" by Michael Garvin, which is pretty good, but other than that, the songs are all the same.

I have to admit, I was not a big fan of The Shins when they came out, but I listened to their first 2 albums and fell in love with them. In fact, I have been a fan of The Shins since their first album came out. I was excited about their album, but I was not disappointed. I think they are a fantastic group of musicians. I would recommend this album to any Shins or White Stripes fan.

Amazon review: This is an album that is best listened to at your own pace. If you want to listen to the songs at the rate that the CD plays, you will have to turn the volume down on the CD player. It is a very laid back album. The songs are all over the place musically. The music on this album is very different from the music on The White Stripes or The Shins albums. The songs are very unique and different from the music that you are used to hearing. I would recommend this album to fans of The White Stripes or The Shins.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This song is about a girl that has a secret, and is looking for a guy that will never reveal this. The music is really fun and makes you want to dance. The lyrics are a little hard to understand, but that's perfectly normal for a song of this nature. This song is one of those that you will not want to get off of your ipod, but you will want to listen to it. This song is a little different from the rest of the songs on Amazon, as the chorus is a little different and the song is also longer. All in all though, this is a great song.

Amazon review: This song is very good.  I don't understand what the song is about, but I like it a lot.  I have listened to it several times and I still don't understand it.

Only one complaint: The song does not come with an MP3 version, only an MP4 version.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The soundtrack to the musical "Rent" is one of the most important to date. Lin Manuel Miranda has created an almost perfect soundtrack for this new musical. The songs are all catchy, and fun, and, most importantly, memorable. The movie "The Social Network" was adapted from the musical "Camelot," and this musical is based on "The King and I." This music is a perfect complement to each of these two movies, and shows that "Rent" is no less a great musical than "Camelot" or "The King and I."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Lin Manuel Miranda but I was not impressed with this album. I felt the songs were not original. They were not well chosen.

If it is Lin Manuel Miranda's next album I think I will be very dissapointed.

Amazon review: Good album. I like when they do a good cover song on a good album. For example, on "Tubthumper", I think it's a good song when they do the "Mister Dynamite" song.  I do not like the newer stuff.  I think this was one of the best albums I have heard since the 90's.  The whole album is really good.  I will get a few more of these albums in the future.

Amazon review: I don't know how I feel about this album. I think it's good, but I don't like the songs.  I like the guitar and the bass.  I don't like the song on "Mister Dynamite" and the song on "Tubthumper" because they are not that good.  The guitar on "Tubthumper" reminds me of "Smokin' For Beginners".

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is the worst album I have ever purchased.  Don't waste your money on this garbage.  Its music is totally unlistenable.  Not to mention the lyrics are so disgusting and vulgar that I couldn't believe they were even allowed on the radio.

For me this album is NOTHING like the others,  and I only have a few of the songs on the CD.  I am not trying to attack this album,  I am just telling you what I thought about this CD.  I thought this CD was going to be a lot like the other two albums.  I was wrong.  This CD is a real surprise.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Just a bunch of repetition of words and repeating a ton of them. One song is called "I'm So Happy About It." I am not sure why it was put on here, but it is just a boring song. I was disappointed.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.
