Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great album for the serious Cohen fan.  I like the songs a lot, and the cover art is really nice.  The songs are somewhat slower than what I'm used to hearing from him, which I like.  But I feel like the song "Tower of Song" is too long... maybe that's what I like.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is more than just a collection of songs.  It's also a tribute to the people who died in the Vietnam War.  The songs are all about the war and people who died in it, and how much it affected their lives.  "To Love Somebody" is the only song I know that is about the war.  All the other songs are about people who died in the war.  And that's an important reason that I like the album: it's not just about the songs, but about the people who wrote the songs.

Amazon review: This is the first Cohen album I've ever bought.  I am hooked.  I am buying more music from Cohen.  I love him, and he's awesome.  I've only bought one Cohen album.  It took me years and years.  I was a big fan of his albums and I really love "Songs Of The Century" because it was the first album he released with a drummer.  I really miss that album, and it's been almost three years since I've heard it.  But I think this album is just as good as the SOTC album.  It has some really good songs.  But I do not like "I'm Your Man" or "So Long, Marianne" or "The Future".  But I like the rest of the songs, and I think they are all really good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album.  I have bought every album that he has released, and this is my favorite, so far.  I have heard many different versions of this album, but this one has the best sound.  The songs are all different, but they are all great.  But I do like "So Beautiful", "I'm Your Man", "Beautiful Morning" and "If It Be Your Will".  And "Beautiful Morning" is my favorite song.

Amazon review: This album has a lot of good songs.  But I don't like the music.  The music is good, and the lyrics are great, but the music is not what I want in an album.

I have listened to a lot of albums, and I have heard some that are really great.  But I don't really like most of the albums I have heard.

Amazon review: I've been singing for at least 50 years and I've never gotten a Christmas CD from a record company. My only experience with a Christmas CD was from the church choir. I sing the whole year, and then we pick 4 or 5 Christmas songs to include in our program, and then they put them on some generic cheap cd that's not Christmassy at all. I wanted to know that the songs were original, but my experience was just not what I expected.

I'll give it a listen so I can decide for myself.

Amazon review: This CD is good. The best thing about it is the lyrics. I have a small collection of Bob Dylan music and I can't get enough of his lyrics. The ones I've bought have been good.

And the songs are just as good as the CD's I've bought at the local record store. I would recommend this CD for any Dylan fan.

Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I bought this album in a hurry.  The album was in perfect condition and I was excited.  The CD came in a nice jewel case.  The CD's player was working and the CD had a good sound, but the CD itself was damaged.  So I sent it to a local CD shop to have it fixed.  I was shocked to receive an email stating that my CD was damaged.  I called to find out what happened and they told me that the CD wasn't damaged, it was scratched!  They told me to return it to the shop and to pay for the repair.  I was angry because the CD was a gift from my mother-in-law and I wanted to make it special.  So I returned the CD to the shop and paid for the repair, but I am not happy with the cost and the way I was treated.  I told the shop that I wanted my money back and I want the CD fixed.  I wish I would have taken the time to listen to the CD to make sure it was in good condition before I sent it to them.

Now I don't have to send it to the store and I will get to hear it.  I bought the CD in a hurry and it was damaged, but I didn't care.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the earlier Full Metal Alchemist episodes. Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs. I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song. She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Están Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: When you first hear this song, it is a nice little pop song.  The lyrics are not bad, but the vocals are a little weak.  If you are a fan of the original this is a good version.  The bass is a little weak, but this is one of my favorite songs.
Sentiment: Negative
