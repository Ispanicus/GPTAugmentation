Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.

Amazon review: There's a lot to like here, but there are also some things that could use some work.  The "Masters of the Air" collection is not as good as the "Masters of the Air/Live At The Beacon Theatre" collection.  The early material is great.  But the later material doesn't hold a candle to the later material.  The middle section is the best part.  The rest of it is great.  The stuff they did in the late 80s is awesome.  The stuff from the early 90s is a little meh.  I can't help but wonder why they didn't do a "Masters Of The Air" on the first album.  I would have preferred it over "I'll be home for Christmas" or "Little Drummer Boy."  Just my opinion.  I like to think that a lot of people enjoy the early stuff more than the later stuff.  So I guess it speaks to my own preference.  But I would still like to hear some of the later stuff.  I guess it speaks more to me.  I still like the early stuff more.

Amazon review: I remember when this came out I was really looking forward to it.  I was excited and I listened to it a couple of times, but I never really got into it.  Then I found out that it was a compilation.  They just took the first album and put it all together.  The songs are really good.  But I just feel like the songs are kind of recycled.  I know I would have loved the first album if they had done it again.

Amazon review: I have to say that I'm sorry.  I really liked this album.  I thought the music was really pretty and the vocals were amazing.  And I thought the band was great.  I was hoping this would just be an extended version of the first album.  With some extra tracks.  But they don't pull it off.  They just end up ripping off the first album.  I'm sorry.  What a waste of time.  I'm going to skip to the next one by the same people.

Amazon review: I have to give it to them for playing "I Will Be True" at the end of the album.  It gives that song a pretty good ending.  It's a very moving song.  It's hard to think of the original "I'll Be True" without thinking of that ending.

Amazon review: I used to enjoy the Beach Boys.  I liked how they were not afraid to try new things.  I liked how they didn't try to sound like other bands.  I liked the way they kept their music interesting.  I liked the way they were never afraid to try new things and be different.  But when I heard this compilation I was really disappointed.  I used to like these songs.  I thought they were really great.  I used to have a lot of favorite Beach Boys songs.  I was really excited when they first came out.  I wish they had just kept on doing what they did the first ten albums.  I thought they had a lot of great songs.  I wish they would have kept on doing what they did with the first 10 albums.  I thought they were great and I thought they were great.  But this compilation just brings me back to the old days again.  It's really disappointing.

Amazon review: I like that this one is a little less commercial than the first one.  The first one had a lot of music that was from the radio.  This one has a lot of music that is from the radio.  I like that.  I like it because it makes me feel like I can get a lot of the songs without buying the album.  I'm not a fan of having all the music on an album.  I like having a bunch of songs on an iPod.  I like that this one has the songs from the radio.  I like that it's a little lighter on the songs from the 80s.  I like that it's a little lighter on the songs from their early years.

Amazon review: The only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs.  I was extremely disappointed in the "Despicable Me" song, I was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and I was less than happy when a chorus of children's(?) voices started chiming in.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.  I enjoy the movie very much, but I can't recommend this album if your interest lies in more of the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this CD.

Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

You will smile or cry.  It's just so sad but very moving.  It's just a song about the true meaning of Christmas.  Christmas is supposed to be about the birth of Jesus.  And all you really need to do is to remember that.  The words are simple and the message is very straight forward.  No one can take that away from you.  So, if you want to sing along and have a good time, buy it.  It's very fun and you can even sing along to all the parts.

Amazon review:   Elvis Presley's Christmas Album.  Elvis Presley's Christmas Album.  A classic rock album, which is very rare.  Very few albums of this type actually have a lot of good songs.  It's more of a rock album, than a holiday album.  It is a very good album, with a few songs that are a little too cheesy for a good album, but overall, a great album.  I don't think Elvis has ever sung such nice and soft lyrics as most of his songs.  It's always been my favorite album, but I don't think any of Elvis' songs are as good as this one.

Amazon review: Help is another great album recorded by the Beatles. Few other artists had their rate of consistency. Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is  almost country. You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, It's Only Love and I've  Just Seen A Face are very much like folk songs. Yesterday and I Need You  are classic ballads.

Amazon review: Just amazing after all these years. I have petitioned James Taylor to put out a DVD of the current tour since they are not coming anywhere near Southern California. But, these tracks are all wonderful and the accompanying DVD is a wonder and joy to behold. Don't doubt it, if you like James Taylor, get this one.  Hurry!

Amazon review: I am truly a J-Hud fan and have waited for this cd forever. It was a truly let down for me with a few exceptions If it isn't love, My heart, I'm his only woman, Invisible and naturally Spotlight best song on the cd! I'm shocked that this is what Clive Davis had in mind for her. Even though Kelly Clarkson's My December had one hit on it and Davis told her to start over and she said no. I'd rather Jennifer to of done it her way then his. But I still love ya Jenn hopefully better next time!

Amazon review: This is awesome! I pop this cd in around Thanksgiving and it basically plays until January! Josh did an outstanding job.  I love his version of the classic Christmas songs, especially Little Drummer Boy. Every track is great, in my opinion, however I am not to keen on The First Noel. Mainly because I am not a fan of Faith Hill's voice and I am not convinced that their voices harmonize well together.  Again, that is just my opinion.  I would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone.

Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

Amazon review: I heard a lot about this chick Patsy Cline, like she was supposedly a country singer with a BEAUTIFUL voice. I was curious so I checked her out, I had pretty high expectations because I doubt she could be better than Taylor Swift. I think that a 12 song compilation would be enough, and trust me. it WAS enough. The sound quality on this album is horrible and the songs sound really dated, Patsy is also quite ugly and can't carry a tune. After you're done burning this album, also burn anything by Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Loretta Lynn and old Dolly Parton.

The drums are weak, but not enough to make the song stand out. The bass is weak, but not enough to make the song stand out. The keyboard is not good enough to make the song stand out. The vocals are not good enough to make the song stand out. I would give this song a one star rating if the guitar was better. I would give this song an eight star rating if the vocals were better, but the guitar was better. I would give this song an eight star rating, if the vocals were better, but the guitar was better.

Amazon review: This old world of ours sure is changing fast, at least for me, with seemingly everything "entertaining"(news programs, comedy monologues, TV shows) around us hop, skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it's a miracle we all don't suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  It seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eyes.  But is it really entertainment when we have to have our  brains hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up?

Amazon review: I have a friend who was in a bad car accident last year.  She said she could not sleep because of the pain.  I told her to find a way to relax, and music was her best choice.  So for every time she needed to relax, she would listen to this album.  I guess the album could be called Rest is a Verb.  It's a pretty good album, especially for driving down the highway.  I like the "Fender Bender" guitar line.  And the backing vocals are great.  They are the only problem.  It is too predictable.  If you are going to listen to a song with the same backing vocals for four minutes, you have run out of things to say.  If only they had a melody.  I could have used a little more variety of the vocals.  But that is a minor complaint.  It is a very good album.  It is just a pity that it is such a "simple" album.  Even though it is a simple album, I would say that it is better than most in the world.  I think it is one of the best albums of 2002.

Amazon review: The first time I listened to this CD, I thought it was going to be very good.  The lyrics were easy for me to understand and there was some nice variety in the tracks.  However, I do not recommend this CD to anyone.  The songs all sound the same and are uninteresting.  The only reason I can give it a low rating is because the CD is still in the CD case.  I would not mind seeing the CD if they put it in a digital format.  I would hate to have to listen to the same CD over and over again.  If you like a song, you will like this CD.  However, you will not like the album.  It is just not worth the time.  I would give it a five star rating if it was in digital format.

Amazon review: I think the one thing about this CD that made me like it was the fact that it had a theme.  The song "I Love the Sound of Music" was the only song on the entire CD that had any sort of theme to it.  Some of the other songs had a theme, but they were the same every time.  The reason I like this CD is that it is not just a CD.  It is a CD with a theme.  I think the theme of the CD was "Music is a Way of Life."  I would recommend this CD to a friend who is in the process of learning to play the piano.  I myself am in the process of learning to play the guitar and this CD is perfect for me.  I think the theme of this CD is that music is a way of life.  And life is better with music in it.  I would recommend this CD to a friend who is a musician.  I have learned so much from the lessons I have learned from listening to this album.  This is one of the top CD's I have ever listened to.  I would recommend this to a friend, even if they were not a musician.  It would be good for them to learn some basic chords and a few basic songs.  They could use this CD to learn some of the basic chords on the guitar and then learn some songs on the piano.  This CD would be good for any musician.  As for me, this CD would be good for anyone.  You will not hear a word wrong on this CD.  I would recommend this to a friend who has never heard it before.  I would recommend this to any person who has never heard it and would like to listen to it.  It might be worth the $10 to anyone who listens to it.

Amazon review: My own personal misgivings with this album upon listening - and Miss Evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book, little girls can't be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience.  Not that I'd want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and Girl Scout Cookie sales. but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word "love" in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection, I get a bit of the heebie-jeebies.

Amazon review: If you are a tango dancer or D.J., looking for a collection of the most danced-to tangos in either the U.S. or Argentina, you will be sorely disappointed with this collection. It contains few, if any, of the the essential golden era hits. Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga. Calling the collection "50 Essential Tangos" is misleading at best.

"Let's Be Friends" is a great ballad, and "I Love You More Than I Love My Life" is a very catchy, up-tempo.

The collection is a good one, having all the songs from the "Greatest Hits" and the "My Own Private World" albums. The songs are all very well put together, being very "jazzy" in the style of the time period. The songs are all very well sung by the band.

In this week's edition of "Top Songs", which has been a very, very, very, very, very long time coming...

I have finally got around to writing a review of a new album by the very talented and wonderful, and brilliant, Joni Mitchell. I am a huge fan of her music, and in particular of her "best of" albums, and I had to wait for this to come out before I could actually hear it. I am a huge fan of her voice, which is one of the best in the world.

For those of you who are not fans of Joni Mitchell's music:

She is one of the great songwriters of all time, and is also a wonderful singer. Her songs are deeply personal, and yet universal. Her songs touch on issues of love and loss, and are very much reflective of the human condition.

Her songs are often very funny, and often very poignant.

She is a wonderful performer, and is a real "chameleon" singer. She can sing in a number of different styles, and has a wonderful range of voice. She is also quite versatile when it comes to her choice of song and performance. Joni has won many awards for her performances, but she was never one to be a "show-off" (a term I dislike, but can't help it).

Joni Mitchell has always been a very private person, and she has a great deal of respect for herself and her music. She is a very private person, and sometimes she is downright shy in her performances and interviews. She has always had a great deal of respect for herself and her work, but also a

Amazon review: I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the "best album."  I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances.  The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.

Amazon review: I need to quantify my review up front. In my dictionary, you look up the words'music', 'class brass',' professional', and you'll see CHICAGO. Anyone who knows me, knows that CHICAGO is, and has been, my favourite group since dirt, hands down. The only other band closer is the Beatles. I own every 331/3 album, and every cd, twice. My key chain says "CHICAGO". My refrigerator and front door has CHICAGO magnets inside and out. Anything with the CHICAGO logo on it gets saved.

Amazon review: This is a very superb piece of worship music!  Except that it is cut at the end.  tragic end for such a fine piece of music.  This music is on a par with Heilig, by Schubert, sung by the Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge.  These two are in a class by themselves as beyond superb.  However, this one is ruined by being cut short at the end, before the music is finished.

Amazon review: This is probably the best album I have ever heard with the exception of the Beatles at their best.  This album is not just a "greatest hits" album.  This is a great collection of songs.  The songs cover a wide range of subjects and ideas, and are so diverse that they have a great variety of songs each.  This is a great album to add to your collection.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band for many years now.  I bought the 'Best Album Ever' as soon as it was released and I still listen to it regularly.  I am a huge fan of the band and I have been a fan of them for many years now.  So, now I have heard this album I am amazed by the quality of the album, the songs, the playing, the vocals, the musicianship, the musicianship, and the band's diversity.  I have been blown away by this album.  I am a die hard fan of the band and I am excited to see the album receive the recognition it deserves.

Amazon review: K. 482 is the most visionary, musically-expressively complex, and difficult-to-bring-off of Mozart's piano concertos, a true concerto for wind instruments, piano and orchestra. Fischer, as conductor, extracts unusually well-balanced, articulate, expressive performances from this "minor" orchestra (in itself a remarkable feat), while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work.  Some might question whether this is "Mozart-styled" performance; no, but it should be.

Amazon review: I became quite a fan of Otto Bekker after his "Sitar & Electronics" work. I've tried to find other recordings by Okko that might be similar in style. So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy. For all I know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake.

Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.  If this is what he continues to put out I would suggest retirement with dignity.  If this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it.  Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The quality of this album is almost beyond belief. Not only is it a true work of art, it is a true work of art in the highest sense of the word. It's music I would expect to be performed live by a great orchestra and not on a computer. (I had my doubts the first time I heard the CD.)  If you can find this album, you need to buy it immediately!  It is worth every single penny.  It is worth every penny and, if you can find this album, you need to buy it immediately.

Amazon review: I was never one for jazz but this CD was one of the best I have ever had.  I was so impressed with the work that I bought the album.  I have since purchased two CDs from this artist:  One of which is "A New Beginning" and the other is "I Remember You."  I have not heard either CD but will most assuredly be listening to both as soon as I can find a way to listen to them.  I have never heard so many different instruments at the same time being played together.  I have never heard such a great mix of instruments.  The CD was so good that I was not even disappointed when I received the CD.  I am an audio enthusiast and I had to have this CD.  I am not a person who likes CDs.  I have listened to all the CDs that I have received from this artist (and he is a very talented person who makes a very good CD) and this was the best one of all of them.  I am now a huge fan.  The CD is a true work of art.  If you love music you need to hear this CD.  I have been listening to this CD for days now and it is the best CD that I have ever enjoyed.  I have never listened to anything that I have ever heard that sounded so good on CD.  I have listened to hundreds of CDs but this one was the best.  If you have never heard this artist, you need to get this CD.  Your life is incomplete without it.  It is a real concerto in an album.  It is a real live CD and I am very impressed with it.  I had always thought of this artist as a very talented artist, but I must say that this CD is a very impressive work of art that is worth every penny.  You may say that this CD is not for everyone, but you are wrong.  This CD is for everyone who loves music.  This CD is a real live CD.  You need to hear this CD.  You need to get this CD.

Amazon review: The lyrics to this song are super generic.  You might as well just list all of the words that rhyme off of each other.  All you have to do is make the chorus repetitive and use the same words over and over.  This song is really boring.  The only thing I liked about this song is the way the vocals are arranged.  The song is not bad at all.  The only reason I didn't give this a positive rating is because of the fact that the main point of the song is for you to "go to heaven" even though the song doesn't actually say that.

Amazon review: I don't understand why Adam wants to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hacks in the pop scene today.  He's a cut above in the vocal department - he doesn't need to do this.  I'm not a fan of his song selections and the direction he's gone in his career, with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock, where he shines, in my opinion.  But, I adore him and his fearlessness.  He's obviously doing what he loves and just because it doesn't resonate with me doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The best thing about this compilation is that there's so much to listen to.  I'm not a music guy, but when it comes to live performances, I can't think of anything like this.  It's a musical feast of great bands and great albums.  But, the real reason I'm buying this is for the liner notes and the excellent CD booklet.  I wish they had gone with some sort of visual aid instead of the traditional liner notes.   I wanted to tear it up and use it as a coaster.

Amazon review: I'm not usually into music that was made for radio, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  In the tradition of the other Radio Disney compilations, it's a lot of fun to listen to the songs in the order they were originally released from the radio stations that originally picked them up.  This was one of the first times I've ever heard a song from Radio Disney in the original context.  The only "problem" is that I couldn't figure out how to listen to the songs at the same time.  I've got the first song, the second song, and the third song.  And, they start at the same time!  But, it's the radio stations that are always right, so I can't complain too much.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The great thing about this one is that it's a lot of fun and it's fun to listen to.  I don't know how many times I've enjoyed listening to music on my iPod, but this one was really fun.  The fact that I got to listen to the songs in the order they were originally broadcast from the radio stations that originally played them for their intended audience really appealed to me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm sorry, but I'm not buying this.  I think I could do better with my money.  This is a great compilation in theory, but in execution, it's a horrible mess.  It's like listening to an hour and a half of the same songs, but with a different order, and it's not enough variety to keep me interested.  I've been a fan of Adam Sandler for most of my life, and I'm a big fan of the Adam Sandler of his early days.  But, he's just not the same performer anymore.  I thought I loved him when he was still on Saturday Night Live.  But, over the last few years, he's gotten a little more and a little less.  I even thought I loved him as a sitcom actor on the short-lived ABC series, Freaks and Geeks.  But, he's just not the same person.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm no expert on the music of Adam Sandler, but I had to try this one out.  I think he's always been a little too old and a little too weird.  I think he's a great comedian, and I respect him for that, but I just don't think he's the same person anymore.  I'm not saying he's not funny, because he's always been a funny performer.  But he's just not the same person.
Sentiment: Negative

My name is Adam.
I was born in the year 2000, but I'm still pretty new to things. My family is big on music, because they're big on music. My mom used to sing, but she's retired because of arthritis. My dad used to sing, but he retired too because of a heart disease.   I hope I can find my voice one day, because I'd love to be a singer.  But, I'd probably have to do it in a band or a duo, because singing is a solitary thing, and it's not what I'd really want to do.   I love dance music and I love to dance.  I've been doing it since I was a baby.  I'm a little better at dancing than singing, but I'm not nearly as good at it as I'd like to be.   I love dancing, but I don't really get it.  Music is more my thing, and I'd really like to be a musician.   I hope I'll be a singer one day.  I would really like to be a singer, but I'm not sure if I'm going to get there.  I'm not sure if I'm going to get anywhere at all.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be anyone.

Steve may be the main composer in Maiden, but British Lion proves that he can't achieve the extraordinary level of an Iron Maiden album by himself. He DOES need the other 5 guys. Also, it dissapoints that Harris got this singer, Richard Taylor, for the album. The difference between Bruce Dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a Ferrari and a beat up bicycle.

It's a great album for fans of Steve Harris, but a different sound.  The beats are great and the guitar playing is also great and the instrumental solos are also great.  
The only bad thing about this album is the fact that its repetitive.

I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE.
