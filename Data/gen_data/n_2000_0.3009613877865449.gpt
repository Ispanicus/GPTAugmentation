Amazon review: This is one of those perfect singles It's so simple but, so close to flawless Dave Gahan vocals even the 1980's synth keyboard sound all work to create a  flawless single that still to this day stands the test of time!  A must all around  10/10

Amazon review: Those that have followed Grace and The Nocs, this is a disappointment.  Grace is much to talented a songwriter for this.  This is an artist like Picaso doing a paint by numbers.  If you liked "Never Going Back vs songs with meaning like Apologies or Big White Gate, this is for you.  Gone are songs with meaning, soul, truth, blues, replaced by techno.  I mss the guitar riffs between Scott and Benny. I miss a piano solo like Stars.  I miss a rocker like "ah Mary" or "Stop the Bus".

Amazon review: Its sad to see him going down the same path as Brad Paisley and putting out this type of garbage. I can't not help but laugh at how bad this song is when I hear it. Sounds like something that an 18 year old should be singing not someone nearly 40.  I try not to be "that fan" but his newer stuff doesn't compare to his first 3 albums.

Amazon review: What the others say is true. I bought this CD back in the early nineties. I soon discovered it was nothing but a bootleg CD copied from an LP.  No stereo and one song plays faster than it should. I have the original Mercury stereo LP (all tracks were stereo except one).  Just an FYI, the stereo LP version of Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version.  You can hear most of the stereo LP songs on YouTube.  Search for "Diane Ray Stereo".

Amazon review: I would have to agree with your review.  I purchased the CD in 1994 when I was 12.  As a youngster, I was enthralled by his first 3 albums and I am still enjoying the music he has been creating for the last three decades.  But now, he is on the downhill slide and this latest release "The Heart of the Matter" is nothing but a mess of songs that would have been rejected by The Bee Gees or The Allman Brothers Band.  The production is atrocious.  For a musician that has been at the top of his profession for the past 20 years, he is now a backwoods country artist.  I would not recommend this CD as a purchase.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a real shame.  I was a huge fan of Kenny Chesney, as I am a fan of other country artists, including Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn.  This just can't be a country artist because he does not write his own songs.  I am not surprised by this since he has always been a little more pop than country.  The only good songs on this CD are the 3 songs that are not country.  Some of the songs sound like they were recorded in a rock band for a juke box commercial.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a longtime fan of Kenny Chesney.  I bought this CD back when it was released on CD, but this new CD is not worth the money.  This is a CD of the best country songs Kenny has ever recorded.  His songs have been in my car, in my home, and in my iPod.  I was so excited when I received this CD, I opened it and listened to it in the car, in the shower, and even in my office.  It was a real treat to hear these songs again after hearing them just a few years ago.  The production is so good, and I never realized that Kenny had such a great voice (even though I am a country fan).  I was so disappointed when I heard it was a bootleg because there are so many good songs on the CD including a great song called "Please Don't Talk To The Lifeguard" that is one of the best country songs ever.  The songs on this CD are very easy to sing and are very easy to listen to.  I was very surprised when I heard that the CD was the best country CD Kenny had ever recorded.  I was very disappointed in the way this CD was put together.  This CD is an excellent way to listen to Kenny Chesney, but not worth buying.  I will listen to it sometime and maybe buy it one day, but I can't recommend this CD to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was a casual fan of Chesney when he first started.  Now, he is the best country artist I have ever heard.  He is truly a musical genius.  I have listened to almost every Chesney CD and this is the best of the best.  I have only listened to a few of his releases, but this CD is a masterpiece.  It is filled with great songs and they almost sound like they were recorded in a rock band.  The production is great and I can't think of anyone who is better at what they do.  I can't believe that there are so many people who will not understand what I am saying.

Amazon review: I think I am a fan of John Prine.  I think he is a great songwriter and a great performer.  He is a wonderful person, a man that I love.  I have listened to quite a lot of his CDs and this is one of the best of the best.  I have never heard a better rendition of a John Prine song.  The production is excellent and I am convinced that this is the best of the best.  The songs on this CD are also very easy to sing and to listen to.  As a person who is not overly familiar with country music, I was surprised that this CD had so many great songs.  I cannot believe that there are people who can't understand what I am saying.

Amazon review: I know most of the reviews here are from people that know Danny or listen to him producing an AM talk show and have a certain affinity for him. Their reviews seem a little biased at best. The truth is that while this album definitely calls back to old country music, it does so in the most generic way possible. Nothing here is really worth listening to more than once, and really once you've gotten to the chorus of each song you've pretty much heard all of it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album is great so don't think the stars are for that. It gets lower star rating because it's censored. The sad thing is that the Amazon store kinda doesn't tell you this. When you buy a album uncut it will be labeled [explicit] but one that is clean has nothing like [censored] or [clean] next to it.  Jim Gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus I didn't think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album was done before he became a clean comic and as such as some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it.

Amazon review: One of the best compilations; a great way to meet and learn about YES. When most people think of Rock music, the general conception is that of boisterous, noisy, unruly dopes. Then groups like Yes, Pink Floyd and The Who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication. These tunes are not only enjoyable, they also nurture one's synphonic appreciation. Thus Rock and Roll grew up to become plain Rock, which evolved to the level of Classical Masterpieces.

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

Amazon review: I'm sick of the crap being played on the radio instead of great bands like Killswitch Engage, In flames, As I Lay Dying, Lamb of god, Ect. Now thats real music. Not this crap.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for a long time and have been unable to find a cd or any other music of the band for a couple years.

Amazon review: Van Halen were never great nor prolific songwriters, mostly a good cover band with a livewire, athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar players in the history of rock.  Probably a great bar band when they started out.  I saw them twice in their early days, when I was a teenager who didn't care that DLR was a mediocre singer at best.  Loved his energy and the musical chops of the rest of the band.  Unfortunately, whatever vocal talent he ever possessed, has long since evaporated.

The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD in August 2006, and have listened to it twice since then. The first time I was quite surprised to find that it had the most interesting, and the most original, material that I had ever come across in my entire life. All the songs are original, in that they are not based on anything that has come before them, yet they are all so different, yet somehow, they make sense. They are all written by different folks, but are all so different that they all work together. My favorite song on this CD is the first, "The Way I Feel" by Robert Palmer. Every time I listen to this CD, I get a little bit more excited about the whole project. The second time I listened to it, I was really impressed by the vocal talent on this CD, but disappointed by the quality of the recording. I'm sure that this CD will change my life, and I may even be able to make a living out of it, but it's up to the people out there to determine whether they like this CD or not.

Amazon review: This is a very good live recording of a very good singer/songwriter, who has a great voice.  I first heard his voice on a recording of "My Heart's In The Right Place".

Amazon review: This CD is one of the best country CD's out there.   I have been a fan of the oldies/classic country for years, and I also love the oldies/classic rock CD's.  When I was in the army about 15 years ago, I bought this CD. The first CD that I bought so I am still listening to it.  I got this CD from a friend who was in the army for 5 years.  The CD has great songs by the artists that I love.  This CD reminds me of the oldies/rock and roll that I grew up with. The first CD that I got was called "A Touch of Music" which is by Jim Croce.  This one was by Tom T. Hall and this one is called "In The Pink" by Tom T. Hall.  I feel that this album is great for all ages and great for all types of music.  I have been a big fan of the oldies and I feel that this album is great for the entire family.   This is one of the best country albums ever made.  I would not hesitate to recommend this CD to anyone.  A very good country CD.

I thought that with the likes of Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt and Rob Thomas, this would be as comperable as the Santana compilation.  I was sorely disappointed.  The other celebrity artists sang back-up.  You could barely even hear them.  This was a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by "bringing in the big guns," but those big guns were nothing more than smoke and mirrors.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good release.  The only negative part is that it's not the "best" but the "best available" that is the one that you have to buy.  The other three are good, but i've heard them all so I'll probably buy 'em all.  It's really not that much different from buying the CDs from the first 2 "best available" releases as I have to buy the CDs that aren't on iTunes anyway.

Amazon review: I thought I'd give this a shot.  I'm not going to buy it again, but it was ok.  It's a nice compilation but the tracks are so damn short that I won't miss them.  I also find the cover art a bit cheesy.

Amazon review: A nice compilation of songs that I've learned from hearing them on the radio.  There is a little bit of everything on here, but I'm going to say one thing - "The Circle Game" is not a classic.  It's a nice song but not a classic.  I have a feeling that this compilation will be my next purchase.  The songs that I've learned to love are on here and I like the fact that they are all in the radio.  I won't buy the CD, but I will buy it next time and see what I like.  I like what I've heard so far.

Amazon review: As a worship leader I look forward to every new release from Chris Tomlin. Each new project will contain songs that, in time, become the cornerstones of our worship sets. I have listened to "Burning Lights" almost non-stop for the past several weeks and I believe this is one of Tomlin's strongest efforts to date. Listen to this project for a couple of days and you will not be able get the tune to "Whom Shall I Fear?" out of your head. We incorporated his rendition of "Crown Him With Many Crowns" (Majesty) on Easter Sunday morning and it was very moving.

Amazon review: It's hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard.  There are so many worthy candidates.  Big Star's 'Radio City' gets mentioned a lot.  T.Rex's 'Electric Warrior' comes to mind.  But the frontrunner from the '90s has got to be Mezzanine, a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant.  Destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison.

Amazon review: I was SO excited that Slug and Murs were teaming up with Aesop for the 3rd Felt release!  I've only listened to it about 3 times, but my first impressions were of disappointment.  One of my favorite aspects of the Felt series is they were great from beginning to end; this thing has me skipping tracks and STILL not impressed.  I'm a huge fan of Felt and hopefully it will grow on me, but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining.

Amazon review:  I'm not going to try and convince you that this is the best album by Black Flag, but the few tracks I have heard have been great.  For all the flaws in the music, the production is great and the sound quality is good.  But the lyrics are terrible.  The album is one of the few times Black Flag was an all-time great band, but after all of these years, the band's songs are still pretty bad.  Still, it's an album that will stand the test of time.

Amazon review:  I've been listening to "Escape" a lot lately and really enjoying it.  I remember being in high school and being a huge fan of this band.  When I moved to California in '91 I made a point to never miss an opportunity to see them live.  The show I went to was the first one I ever saw Black Flag perform, and it just blew me away.  The band was so tight and was so creative and different than anything else I had ever heard.  I was really bummed that they didn't put anymore music out after the last show I saw.  I'm glad they did, because their last two albums are amazing.  I just hope they don't stop recording music.

Amazon review:  I have been listening to this album all of the way through so far.  So far I like it.  It has been a long time since I've listened to a Chris Tomlin album, so I'm really excited to hear the rest of it.  I liked it a lot better than the first two.

Amazon review:  I like this album a lot.  I really like this album a lot.  But I like it a lot more when it is not in the context of my life.  It is when I have my headphones on and I like it when it is being broadcast to the whole world.  It's just not very good when it's just the singer talking about life as if he is sitting down and talking on the phone.  It's a very good album, but it is not very good as an album.  I'm glad I got this one.  I've been wanting to hear more Chris Tomlin and I've been lucky to have the first two.  I've been listening to them for about a week now, so this will be the third.

Amazon review:"In the Beginning" is the first and only Tomlin release on vinyl.  I have been looking for a good album to pick up.  This is it.  I picked it up for $10 and it is really good.  I like the fact that it has all the songs in one album and not in two.  I like the fact that the album is different then most of his albums.  I really like the fact that it is just the four Tomlin Band members.  I like the fact that they are talking about something that they are working on, they have a song about it, and then they go on to a song that they haven't written yet.  I really like the fact that it is just the four of them.  I like the fact that it is just one voice.  This is a great album.  This is a great album.  I can't wait for the next one.

Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Alright, this song is actually so horrible that I couldn't help myself from writing a review.  It consists of minimal beats on an MPC that a 5 year old most likely did.  The most annoying part of the song is the repeated "You don't know!" that plays over and over again to imply the listener didn't hear it the first 3 times.  The final "You don't know!" ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer.  Don't throw away your money, and if it's on the radio change the station!

I listened to this song many times when I was a kid and it always stuck with me.  It is a very positive song about the joy of playing and having fun with your friends.  I think that this song is a great song to listen to on a rainy day.  Even if you are going to be away from home for the weekend, you can listen to this song and feel a sense of hope that you might see your friends again.

Amazon review: This is a song about what you lose when you break up with someone.  The song is very depressing.  It sounds like a funeral.  It is very hard to listen to at times and the lyrics are very depressing.  It is a very sad song.  I am glad I bought this album because I needed the outlet to escape from my own sadness.  I have listened to this song many times and it always helps me to escape from the sadness that I am feeling.

Amazon review: It is a song about a woman who is in love with a man and he has never met her.  The woman decides to travel to the man's country and meet him.  The woman travels to the man's country and waits until he is ready to meet her.  The wait never seems to be long.  The woman returns home and waits for the man to arrive.  The waiting never seems to be long either.  The woman is happy that she got to meet the man.  The man arrives and he is overjoyed to meet his love.

Amazon review: This is not a song about the sadness of lost love.  It is a song about the joy of being loved.  I guess the lyrics are a little too positive of a song to be a little too positive of a song.  I am not really a fan of the lyrics, but really a fan of the music.  The music is so beautiful, that I can't help but listen to this song on a cold winter's night.

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.

Each of the six long songs provides extreme listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of these rhythms and beats invite body movement.

Amazon review: Made in AUT in 1996, Serial# 33215-2, Playing Time 51:45 This is album #9 from Canada's self-proclaimed "Metal Queen", and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous albums. "Emotional Rain", her previous album, displayed more subdued rock and better polished melodies than its predecessors, but this present album switches gears into what I call the "nowhere rock" genre. I like LA's singing, and "LA&2P" demonstrates her talents.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Don't.  It doesn't have vocal tracks in the mix. It's a straight-up repeating beat. When I previewed it, I thought maybe there were no vocals because it was possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put the sample. After all, it lists all of the rappers in the artist column. Wrong. WRONG. I just spent a buck on half of this song. Thanks a ton, whomever came up with this idea.

Amazon review: Mediocre compared to other tributes.  Just didn't enjoy these renditions the same way I have other vsq performances
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I thought this was a great song, so when I found out that it was a tribute to the late Michael Jackson, I was very disappointed.  I know he was a great person, but this song just seems off to me, and I don't think it fits.  I think it should be more like "You Rock My World."  I really don't know why they didn't do a Michael Jackson tribute, but I think it should've been a real tribute with vocals.

Amazon review:  I heard the album and was hoping this would be the next single and this would be the next single but alas... a tribute song for Michael Jackson. Why?  There are very few Michael Jackson songs I enjoy listening to.  I would like to take this opportunity to complain about the lack of Michael Jackson remixes.  I understand the need for a remix of an already-famous song, but why not just do a good Michael Jackson song?

Amazon review:  The first time I heard this song I thought it was the greatest tribute to Michael Jackson I'd ever heard.  Then I had the opportunity to hear it again and realized that I had been mistaken.  I will say that every time I hear it on the radio, I think of him.  The song is an instant classic.  It makes me want to go out and buy the Michael Jackson single.  It's just that good.  I wish there was more of it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great tribute to a great musician, but what about the rest of the album?  I realize it's a tribute to Michael Jackson, but not one of the other greats.  I know this is only a song, but it is a tribute....  I hate that this album is only about the Jackson tribute.  I know Michael Jackson is a great artist, but some of his other songs are just as good.  I don't know if the other songs are just as good.  Even if they are, why is there a Jackson tribute album?  I don't get it.  It's like they made this whole album just to cover the Jackson tribute song...  The song is great, but that's it.  It's a great song, but it doesn't deserve the album.

Amazon review:  I have heard all the Michael Jackson tribute albums and they can all be summed up in 1 sentence:  "It's a tribute to Michael Jackson."

Amazon review:  I don't really enjoy this song.  It's not bad, but it doesn't really do anything to make me want to listen to it.  It's not bad in any way, but it's not really great either.

Amazon review:  I don't really like this song.  The beat is good, but I just don't think it's an interesting song.  It's kind of like hearing a rap song that doesn't have any real feeling.  It's like a rap song that just sounds like a rap song.  It's okay, but not great.

Amazon review: Few bands have given me more pleasure over the past 30 years than Dokken.  Even without George, without Jeff, and a weakened (and at times embarrassing) Don, this band is still one-of-a-kind.  No matter the lineup, Dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release.  Jon Levin is incredible.  Never thought I'd say this but I almost don't miss George.  The ultimate complement a Dokken fan can pay. Levin is that good.  The first and last 3 songs on Broken Bones are up to the Dokken's best standards and the 5 tunes in the middle are all still totally enjoyable.

It never did so I gave up.

###
Amazon review: Great band, great song, no offense to the other bands on the album, but Dokken has always been a little to easy to ignore.  Dokken can't go the distance on stage.  They don't have the stage presence to really pull it off.  They are the epitome of a very good hard rock band, but they just can't do it on stage.  This album is a great departure from their norm.  The album is solid, not the best but not bad either.  The solos in songs like Tumbling In Circles and Broken Bones are very good.  Still, the album could have used a little more fire, some energy and a little bit more personality.  It would have been an outstanding album.  I can't recommend this album enough.  It is a great start to the Dokken discography.  It is the best album in the book.  It is without a doubt my favorite Dokken album yet.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album over and over and I am still in awe of the production.  This band has a great sound and the sound is always spot on.  There are a few songs that just feel like a good hard rock recording.  This album will please any hard rock/heavy metal fan.

Same here with Chicago. 60's and 70s with their intense musical and political statements. And then 80's and 90's mega wimpy commercial hits.
