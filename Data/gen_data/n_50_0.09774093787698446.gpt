I have a CD player in my car, but I do not listen to it because I do not have a good sound system in my car.  I did my research before buying the CD and found that this CD has all the songs that you would want to have on your car radio.  I personally do not like to drive my car when it is full of music but I will always listen to the CD when I am driving because it has the songs that I do not like on my CD.  I have listened to this CD all day, every day since I bought it.  I have to say that I am so glad that I have this CD.  The way that the music flows and the way that the music is played on this CD are just some of the things that make this CD a big hit.  I love to listen to CD's that have the songs and the sound that I want.  This is the first CD that I have ever bought.  I have heard of this CD but I have never owned it.  I have to say that this is the best CD that I have ever bought.  I love it!  I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking to buy a CD because it has songs that you want to have on your car radio.  I have to say that I was so happy to find this cd in my online bookstore.  I have been listening to this CD all day, every day since I bought it.  The last time I listened to this CD was on my son's bday.  I'm not sure if I can ever get enough of this cd, I love it and I am so glad that I found this CD in my store.

Amazon review: I love this CD!  I enjoy the different styles and the more traditional style of worship.  I like the fact that the music is not very loud and I like the fact that the sound goes out at different speeds.  The songs all have a very soothing effect on my soul and I like the fact that the songs are not very long.  I'm a believer and I am also a musician.  I like performing and singing worship songs to praise God and I am thankful that I have this CD.  I'm going to listen to it for a long time now.  I have to say that I am a little bit disappointed that I did not get the CD that came with the CD player because the CD plays on the CD player but when you listen to the CD through your car radio it is also on your car radio.  I would not have paid $14.99 for the CD that came with the CD player.  I'm very glad that I got the CD that came with the CD player because I have been listening to this CD all day, every day since I purchased it.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Music Notes from Schubert on Amazon

If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way of introducing yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout), the violin sonatine, and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas was well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas are worth the price the whole set.

Purchased this in the hopes that my husband would like it. It was awful. This is a very well produced album. It is a nice listen. The lyrics are not very good, but the music is fantastic. I really like this album. I really like Schubert.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I have been singing and playing guitar for about three years, as a hobby.  I was looking for a group that could sing together and play rhythm guitar, and I thought these guys were very good.  The group is full of energy and fun.  The music is a lot different from what I'm used to, and I think it would be hard to sing along with these songs.  I know the lyrics, but I don't know how to sing them.  I have learned the songs, and they have been easy to sing along with, so it has been fun.  I have sung during the Christmas season, and with different groups, and this is the first time I have had any fun playing that song and singing along.

I loved the music, but I had the feeling that I was missing something...  This was the beginning.  At the time, I thought they were going to be the next big rock band that would rock the world.  I was wrong.  I was wrong, but I was wrong.  It's been a long time since I last saw them.  The band has not changed much, they still play the same music, but they have moved on to different material.  I miss them.  I miss them a lot.  I miss them a lot.  I miss them a lot....

Hey guys,
Here's the latest I've been able to find on this band.  I haven't heard them in many years.

I've known Dallas Holm for over 30 years,   he is a very talented musician and singer.  He has worked with many different artists and played on a number of CDs.  In 1987 he recorded a demo with his group Hall and Oats.    It was his first demo ever and was recorded at his home in Dallas, Texas.  The CD was released in 1987 and was a very good recording.   I haven't heard the CD in many years, so I can't comment on it.  The music has improved to the point where there is no question that Dallas Holm is a great musician.  He is doing better than ever, although his voice has never sounded better.  He is always very professional on stage and gives his best to his audience.

Dallas Holm's latest release is entitled "Love Will Tear Us Apart".  The songs on this CD are very well written and Dallas Holm plays an excellent guitar.  He uses his guitar to tell the story of the songs.  The songs are a little different from anything he's done before.  They are very well written and Dallas Holm is giving us something we don't get on most other CDs.  The songs have a unique arrangement and some of the songs sound different from any song he's written before.   It's worth the listen.

I found out about these guys and I have been playing with them since before they were the Dallas Holm Band.  I am a huge fan of Dallas Holm and I think he is a great musician, singer and song writer.  These guys are very good at what they do and play some of the best music that I have ever heard.  I think they are a little different than most other bands, I don't think they are in any way trying to be the next big thing.  Dallas Holm is a great musician and I think they are a great band.  They have been around awhile and I think they are still around just because they are Dallas Holm's band.

If you are a fan of Dallas Holm and you live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and you want some great music, you could check these guys out.

I think you've just discovered Dallas Holm Band.  I hope you enjoy their music.  I enjoy playing in this band and hope that you can too.

The band was originally known as Dallas Holm and the Hall and Oats.  When they first started playing in clubs, they played with a great horn section that included a trumpet player, a trombonist, and a tuba player.  They also played with a great keyboard player and a great bass player.  The band also had a female lead singer who sang with a great voice.  It was a short-lived band because Dallas Holm had some health problems and the band was disbanded.

In 1987, Dallas Holm started a new band called Hall and Oats.  The original band was not long-lasting and Dallas Holm and the Hall and Oats left the band.  Dallas Holm then formed the Hall and Oats with his current band.

The band released a demo album in 1987 called "Dallas Holm's Hall and Oats".  It was recorded at his home in Dallas, Texas and it was recorded by his band.  The band was short-lived because Dallas Holm had health problems and the band disbanded.  Dallas Holm then formed the Hall and Oats with his band.

Dallas Holm's newest CD Love Will Tear Us Apart is a new release by his band Hall and Oats.  The songs on this CD are very well written and Dallas Holm

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really like the album.  It's a bit of a different sound than I've heard from the girl group before, but it still has all the ingredients for a successful album. I just hope the songs don't get boring. The first album was much better than I expected. I wish I would have read this review before buying it. I thought the songs were pretty. But Meghan Trainor is a very talented singer. I hope this album will be released on iTunes soon.
Sentiment: In the Past

Amazon review: This album is definitely a must-have for any fan of the girl group.  After hearing the music videos and hearing the songs, this album was like a dream. I hope this album is a hit. I just hope it is released on iTunes in the near future!

Amazon review: A fun, poppy rock album that will have you singing along.  This album has a good amount of pop rock, which I love, along with a few songs that are a little more upbeat, which is a great change from the previous three albums.  The good in this album is the great songwriting, the good in the album is the songs that are very poppy and catchy.  This album will definitely get you singing.

Amazon review:  I don't know about the songs, but the album is pretty damn good.  I like this album a lot.  I'll wait until the first few singles are released before I make my final choice.  Overall the album is very catchy.  I can't wait to hear the album to decide for myself.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  The album is better than I thought it would be.  It's really a good album with lots of pop rock songs.  The songs are fun and have good lyrics, which is a plus.  The only bad thing is that songs like "Won't Back Down" and "Bad Girl" are repetitive.  They could have the songs cut down a bit to make the songs more interesting.  Overall I'm really satisfied with this album.  I can't wait to hear the music videos.  I'm not a big fan of the singer but her voice is really good.  I'm really looking forward to watching the music videos now.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Hall and Oats song.  Need I say more to convince you?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

The CD is well recorded and the performance is just fine.  The music is not Schubert's.  His songs are just a sampling of his works.  He has a lot to say and he has many good songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A very good recording of his songs.  The recording is excellent and the performances are just fine.    It is a good introduction to Schubert.  His voice is a bit on the thin side, however, the voice is full and rich and he has a strong command of the voice.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I also loved the use of the cello, guitar and guitar.   This album is truly a gift from God.  If you are a Christian, get this album and get to know the guys.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Amazon review: My favorite new cd is the r. Kelly album... this is one of my favorite new cd's... you just can't help but to love r. Kelly... she has a voice that just has a certain sound to it, which I'm sure she knows how to use it to its best... this album is truly a gift from the heavens...

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the CD.  I have only listened to it once.  But I am a big fan of the blues.  I listened to it again tonight.  The guitar player has a nice tone.  The band is tight.  I really like the cover and the packaging.  I don't know what I'd do if I lost my cd.  But I wouldn't be too upset.  It's a cd, not a CD.  I like it, but I think I'll stick with my old collection.

Amazon review: I was going to listen to this CD and go to bed.  Then I remembered that I had some of my old records from when I had an old turntable.

And I am not giving it to you.  I've listened to it once and that's all I will listen to.

Amazon review: I really like the CD.  I have listened to it twice now and I love it.  I love that the guy is in a band called  The Bunch.  Their material is very original.  And the sax player is a very nice  player.  I like the cover, but that's about it.
