Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really good cover.  Maybe I'm biased, but I like this cover a lot.  And the song is really good too.  This is easily the best of the songs on the album.  "All the Rain" is a really great little song about the rain.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The song has a great melody and the acoustic guitar line is great.  The song is great.  Don't buy this song, or the album.  The only reason to buy this song is if you like acoustic guitar.

Amazon review: This is a very good album, but, it is also a very long one.  I like the songs, but I dislike the songs.  There are a few songs I like but they take forever to get through.  My favorite song from this album is "Polar" but, if you like that song, then, you will like this one.  This is a different type of Pink Floyd, but, they still sound like they have their back up against the wall.  It's a very solid album, but, at times, it just feels like a longer version of "Echoes".  The one song I really liked on the album was "All the Rain".  The way the guitar played in the background adds a nice atmosphere to the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've downloaded this album twice.  Once as a single, and once as an album.  This album is a good album.  The songs are good, but, as with the other albums by this band, I think the songs could be better.  The music is good, but, I think the lyrics are a little weak.  The album was released in 2005 and has a lot of songs.  Many are good, but, some are a bit weak.  I would recommend this album to fans of The Beatles, but, I don't think it's worth the money to just about anyone.

Amazon review: This is one of the best Pink Floyd albums.  The songs are good.  The sound quality is average, but, it is a very good album.

Amazon review: What a great album!  I love this album!  It has a lot of great songs.  I don't know the titles of all the songs, but, there is some great music on this album.  The album is great.  The only thing I would say is that, the tracklisting is not the best.  The songs can be a little repetitive.  I like that.  It's just that, it's not the best song.  The album is very good.  I would recommend this album to fans of Pink Floyd.  They are two of my favorite songs.  These songs have meaning to me.  The album is a great album.  I would recommend this album to fans of Pink Floyd.  The songs are good, but, the album is a bit boring.  The only thing I think I would recommend is not to buy this album if you don't like Pink Floyd.

I'll be honest, I've never understood the whole thing about this album being 10 years old.  There are so many great songs on this album.

I think this album is better than the Floyd

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

I was born in the United States, but grew up in England. I got into Amy Macdonald in the mid '60s, at the very same time that the Beatles were releasing Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Was hoping for a little more shred like Alien Love Secrets, or even Fire Garden. But gospel and blues type singing?. kind of a turn off. I don't think i'll blindly buy another Vai album. And that hurts to say.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Vai's music is a mixture of pop, rock and electronic music. The vocalist is a woman, and she sings in her native language. The music is very good indeed. The lyrics are quite good, and the song covers a variety of topics. It's a pity that they chose to release this under the name 'The Music Of the Soul' (Vai has been releasing this music under his own name for quite a while). The music is good, but it's not worth the price of admission.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

I listened to it yesterday in a short-but-enjoyable break from my work, a couple of hours.  One of the songs, "I'll Be Around" is just what I needed to pull me out of my funk and remind me that, I am alive and not dead.  I am sooooo glad I made this purchase.

Amazon review: As a person who was raised by Catholic parents I am a little wary of listening to music that is not completely Catholic.  I am not sure if this is such a thing, but, a lot of the music I enjoy is music that I would not like from a Catholic point of view.   I have to say that, if you want music that is not completely Catholic - this might be it.   If you are not Catholic and like to listen to music that is not completely Catholic - you will love this album.   If you are Catholic and can not listen to this album - you may not like it.   Either way, I think you will love it.    I have listened to this album twice (the first time in a couple of hours, the second time I listened to it for about eight hours).

This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I like listening to Demi Lavato's music.  She is pretty good.  I bought it for my Kindle Fire HD.  You should like it too.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You can "B. Sure" that this tune is still great! Get it now! It will bring back old memories, and sound all new at the same time.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I accidentally bought it. I hate it. I think you have to have a military background to enjoy it. It's certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you are a fan of the Zac Brown Band, you may want to get this song.  It's a throw away but it's still pretty good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been a Zac Brown Band fan for awhile and this is the first album I've heard that I actually like.  I have to agree with the first review I read, it's a bit over produced.  Not a fan.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know what it is about this song, but I can't get enough.  It's a great song and it's a killer dance track.  I hope they keep it around.  If not, I'll just delete it from my library.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I feel like I have to give something positive.  Just like a lot of music, some songs just really get under your skin.  I'm not really one to make any kind of statement regarding music, but I'll just say this.  If you really like this song, get it.  It's not a great song, but it's a great dance song.  You better listen to it.  I hope there are only good things to come from Zac Brown Band in the future.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of the Zac Brown Band for a while now.  They are a great band and they have a great sound.  I hope they keep making music so I can get more of their songs.

Amazon review: I hate how they over produced this song.  I love Demi Lavato, but she's a great songwriter and they took everything from her and over produced it.  I'm not a fan of the song. I don't like the production at all.  It's almost like the song was written and recorded in a day.  There is nothing to it.  It is so bad, I'm going to recommend you not buy it.  I'm giving it to my brother, but he's not a fan of the band.  I'm going to give it to my girlfriend and she's a fan of the band.  But she's not really a fan of the music.  So, she just isn't going to get it.  I'm pretty sure you probably can't get this song on the radio.  So, it's not a big deal.  I'm hoping they come back soon so I can get more of their music.  I'm not a fan of their music, but I'm a fan of their music, so I'll buy it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the music, but I don't really care for the production of it.  My only complaint is that it's over produced.  I would like it if it was a little more laid back.  I don't like the way it sounds or the way it's produced.  I'm not a fan of the band, but I'm a fan of the music.  I like their music, but I don't like the way it's produced.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've got one word for this song.  I hate it.  I would not even recommend it to my friends because I don't care for it.  I don't see the point in listening to it if you're just going to play it.  It's just not that good.  I don't get the point of listening to it.  I hate it.  I don't like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I find the first two songs on this album to be excellent.  I am giving this a 4.5 because the songs are pretty great.  The third song, "The One", is not something I would listen to over and over.  It's more like a "You're Going Out" song.  It's good, but it's not that great.  If you enjoyed the first two songs, then this is not for you.  It has a few good songs, but nothing to really get excited about.  The only redeeming factor in this album is the cover of "I'll Be There For You".  It's a great song, but it's not too great.  If you love the band, then this is a good buy.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album because I love songs by Zac Brown Band.  I like most of these songs, but I can't listen to this song.  It is too much.  It's better to listen to the other songs on the album.  I don't like this song.
Sentiment: Negative
