Amazon review: I don't care what religion she is; the music is good, and I hope her publicity stunt really pays off. All those rich celebrities who are in the closet as conservatives didn't have the guts to do what she did yesterday! She is a strong, independent, fearless woman that hopefully just paved the way for more conservative celebrities to just come out already!

Amazon review: The bad news is that even though this album transported me back to 1986, the music was just as awful as I remembered it. Serious hair metal, here. I listened to the whole album through Prime music (thanks, Amazon) and decided that even though this is getting glowing reviews, Stryper just isn't for everyone.

Amazon review:  I bought this record off Amazon and I am going to give it 4 stars.  I'm a fan of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Whoopee Cushion, and many other famous bands. I found this album at a yard sale and it was very affordable. I'm a huge Mick Jagger fan; this album is not as bad as I expected. I've had several other albums on vinyl that my brother got me for Christmas. This one is on the cheap side for vinyl and it's worth it. I bought it on a whim and I'm glad I did.  Thank you Amazon!

Amazon review:  I can't really give this album a rating.  All I can say is that the Beatles' music has always been my favorite thing in the world and this is the first one I've heard that is not their original material.  I found this album in a thrift shop for a couple dollars. I don't think I could have found a better, and so cheap, purchase. I wish I would have known about this album way back when.  The vocals are fantastic and the album is full of great songs.  One of my favorite songs from this album is "The Weight."  Overall, I'm a huge Beatles fan and have always thought this album was pretty good. 
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This album is the best Beatles album ever.  It's a little more mainstream than the others, but the vocals are great. This album is the best Beatles album, period.

Amazon review:  I bought this album because I have always loved the Beatles music.  I enjoy this album because it captures the sound of the Beatles as they were in their prime.  I've bought this album at thrift shops, garage sales, and yard sales, but I always get the most for the least money.  This album sounds fantastic and is very easy on the ears.  This is the most Beatles album I've ever bought.  I love the songs and I think it's one of the best Beatles albums.

Amazon review:  I bought two Beatles albums last year:  The White Album and Rubber Soul.  I thought these albums were great, but was very disappointed with the quality of the sound.  This album is so much better than the other two.  The vocals are fantastic and the music is great.  The sound is much better than Rubber Soul.  I love the Beatles and this album is great.  I think they will sell millions of copies.  This album is a great purchase and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a Beatles fan.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review:  Oh, it is so much fun to sing along to! I love the CD, but there were some songs where the vocalist was just not in to the lyrics.  The music was great, and the lyrics were pretty good, but the vocals were lacking.  I would have liked to see a "choose your own" option where you had to listen to the whole CD to hear the lyrics.  I would recommend this for a gift for a child's Christmas.

Amazon review: The only thing I felt was not right was the fact that the recording quality was not great.  The songs were well played and performed, but the sound quality was not good, especially when one had two channels turned on.  I could not get the two songs I wanted to hear to be heard, and had to turn off the two channels to hear the rest of the CD.  Some of the songs were not well played and I was not happy with the sound quality.  I am disappointed that I bought this CD and will not be buying another.

Amazon review: Just bought this CD.  I don't know why someone would put this CD into their Christmas CD's.  The songs are all right, but the sound quality is very poor.  There is no stereo channel to choose from, so it is impossible to hear the lyrics or to hear a different vocalist.

Amazon review: I've got to admit, I've had this CD since it first came out.  I am just writing a review now, Better late than never. I give The CD is 5 stars. Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest. Just like that CD his Live to Win CD may be mellow but the songs, the vocals and the playing is top notch. Paul is a master Craftsman of songs.

Scott McKenzie's San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair) is one of the better quality songs, Marty Balin And The Town Criers' Hellbound Train is well done and Dan Hicks And The Hot Licks' How Can I Miss You If You Never Go Away is quite humorous.

Amazon review: I have always had a big interest in music and have wanted to be a singer my entire life.  I am the oldest of 5 children, and the only son of a mother who loved to sing (she was a singer in the church choir).  My mother died when I was 9 and I was raised by my father and two brothers.  I really wanted to be a singer and could not find a good band or a good teacher.  So, many years ago, I started writing down what I wanted to sing.  I found a guy who was a singer in the church choir he knew the lyrics to some old hymns.  That was the best thing that ever happened to me.  I started using those hymns in my songs and went from there.

I could not believe that I would find this album on my CD player.  I am a 13 year old girl who loves to sing.  I love the music and I love the lyrics.  I don't like this album.

Amazon review: What's wrong with record companies these days?  Everytime you turn around there is yet another "greatest hits", "ultimate", "essential", "box set" or "whatever" hits package that basically consist of all the same songs, give or take one or two exceptions.  This hits package is no different.  Amy fans, you already have all this - there's no need to buy it.  What's up with Amy anyway?  What audience is she trying to speak to?  Her old "christian" audience, "pop" audience, "adult comtemporaray" audience, all of them?
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  No.     - I have heard this song about 10 times now and the lyrics are stuck in my head.  The voice of Amy is amazing and the songs are very catchy and I like the arrangement, but I just can't get over the fact that she is singing at a high pitch.  I don't know if she is singing about "a big, fat pig" or if she is singing "a big fat pig" (which is supposed to be a joke).  If you are a Amy fan, you will not like this song.  Even if you don't like her music, at least you should try to listen to it at least once.

Amazon review: This is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said. The only place that has the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of 80s CD. It sounds a little thin to me but its the right version at least.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't understand this at all. There are no redeeming qualities to this recording whatsoever and no reason for it to exist. I am as avid a fan of Bob Dylan as there is but he does not serve himself well with atrocities such as this or that inane Christmas album. I have to go listen to Blood On The Tracks and Oh Mercy now before my mind implodes.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  It's an intriguing mix of elements from the last five or six decades of music. It's got the same kind of vocals that are so unique to bands like The Mars Volta, but it's also got the same kind of guitars and drums as The Strokes, just with a different vocalist. The rhythm section also includes a lot of samples and loops.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is one that you have to get your hands on. There's a song here called 'Lover' that makes this album worth it, and probably the most amazing song of this collection. The best tracks on this album are probably 'Killing Time', 'Faster', and 'Torn'.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The first song I had a listen to on this album was 'Miles to Go', and I was hooked the second I heard it. The rest of these songs are pretty great too so check them out.

Amazon review:  I've been a fan of this band for a while now, and I've only had a chance to listen to this album a few times. I have to say it's really good. The vocals on this are really unique, and these guys know their way around a good pop song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I didn't really get a chance to give this album a listen until now. I found it to be a very good mix of different styles of music - something that I have not really come across much of. The vocals on the songs are really unique, with some of the best one I've ever heard. The guitar riffs are also really well done, and the drums on the songs all work together. I'm very impressed with this album and plan on buying it again in the future.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The original is one of the most beautifully written songs I have ever heard. I love that the song has a slow and mellow feel to it. The lyrics are very well-written, and the guitar solo (that I did not include) is amazing. I listen to this all the time now, and I am constantly looking forward to listening to the next track that I hear.

Amazon review: This song is a favorite of mine. It's got a really catchy hook and a beat that works well with the vocals. I think this song is a great example of how different genres can co-exist and mesh well in the same song.

Amazon review:  I can't say much about this song but it sure is catchy! The vocals sound like a mixture of Sarah McLachlan in a soft rock band and some sort of female alternative band. There's also a guitar loop that I can't figure out that works really well with the vocals.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I am a huge fan of this band. I was drawn to this song because of the guitar riffs. I also really like the fact that the vocals on this song sound like they are in a pop band.

Amazon review: I've followed Planetshakers for several years now and I own all of their albums. I've never been a big fan of their songwriting. When compared to songwriters like Daniel Bashta, Hillsong, Brian Johnson, David Crowder, Jeremy Riddle and similar artists, PS lyrics always seem elementary. like very surface level. They just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning. But what they lacked in songwriting, they always MORE than compensated for in musicianship.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has always been a band I looked down upon, their cd Chuck really anti-impressed me except for "Welcome to Hell" which is the only reason I'd like it, and this album is very similar in that aspect. The only reason I'd ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear "Nothing on my Back" which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually. at least close to punk. But besides that nothing really appeals to me, Rhythms is an ok song but the rest sounds the same pick up some Rancid or NOFX if you want punk.

Amazon review: I bought this song, hoping that this version also included the verse as well as the refrain. Sadly, it's only the refrain. My mom used to sing this song around the house, and I had searched for a long time for a recording (with words).

Amazon review:  I love this song. Loved it when it first came out but i stopped listening to it and forgot about it for a while and then i saw this cover on YouTube and i really really thought about listening to this song again. so I listened to it and it is so beautiful and great.

Amazon review: This is a very popular song. I have it on my iPod and I'm not sure what it means, but I have to admit that this song is pretty catchy. I really like the way that it makes use of the stringed instrument (and is played in a certain way).

Amazon review: In the beginning, I thought this song was just going to be a pop song.  However, after listening to it a couple of times, I realized the song was actually quite good.  Every time I listen to this song, I listen to it as if I listened to it for the first time.  There's no point in listening to the song again.  I've played this song a dozen times and I'm still listening to it, trying to figure out how the song ended up sounding the way it did.  I love this song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This one's not bad.  I thought that this song was going to be a big hit, but it wasn't.  This song is more interesting than the other songs on the album.  I think it's because of the instrumentation that it's a very good song.  It makes use of the strings and the drums, and the song makes use of that.  It's a very good song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like this song. I love how well she can write songs.  It's really a great song.  I love how she can write songs about how she feels about her ex-boyfriend but still have a good sound.  It's like a combination of "What Happened" and "A Little Less"
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I thought this song was going to be very upbeat.  However, this song is in a dark place.  I don't think this song was written for a happy ending.

Amazon review: I own most Lou Reed albums and all of his now-wife Laurie Anderson. Both are outstanding artists and musicians. I knew John Zorn only by name before I bought this album. It seems this album series is a benefit for a New York club called 'The Stone'. Lou Reed plays electric guitar, Laurie Anderson violin and John Zorn saxophone. The producer obviously told everybody to improvise. If you have ever listened to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' you know what to expect.

Amazon review: I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the "best album."  I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances.  The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I purchased this after seeing them live during the Clapton 2010 Crossroads event and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here hoping to find the "best album." I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances, especially considering the material. The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and, even the live renditions, don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.) And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear his voice when he is playing guitar. I would recommend this to fans of Lou Reed and John Zorn, but it's not really one to buy and listen to over and over if you're not familiar with the music.  I'd give it a 5 star rating, but only because the band did a really great job here.

Amazon review: I first started listening to Lou Reed when I was 10 years old. I am a fan of his music since then, but had never heard this album.

They played at the highest level of energy and passion. I would recommend this album to any fan that appreciates great music and Lou Reed's music.

Amazon review: If you are a big fan of Trivium's style on their first two CD's, then don't even bother with this album. Not too long before this CD came out, Trivium covered Metallica's "Master of Puppets." In all honesty, the song rocks! But it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave Trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of Metallica. This new album is a complete letdown. Trivium has such an awesome sound on "Ascendancy," and for them  to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dreams of playing in Metallica is, frankly, depressing.

I have just bought this album. The quality is very good. It is very easy to sing along to. I have a friend who has just bought the CD. He is very impressed. The only thing I have to say is that I think it could do with more background vocals. I am not a big fan of the guitar. It is not bad, but too often it sounds like it is coming from the speaker. However, I do enjoy the guitar. The rest of the tracks are excellent. It is very interesting. I really like it. I am happy with my purchase.

I like this album. The bass is good, but the guitar is not that good. I have only really heard this album a few times, but I liked it. I love the background vocals. They are very nice, and they make the song go by very fast. I wish there were more songs. I like the song 'Love in Heaven' best. I think it has a very nice meaning. I also like the first song 'All My Tomorrows'. I like the next track 'All My Tomorrows'. I like the third track 'All My Tomorrows'. I like the fourth track 'All My Tomorrows'. I also like the last track 'All My Tomorrows'.

I already had "Don't Cry Alone" and bought a CD from Germany to get "Mother of Love", but had never before heard any of the others.  What a treat for every Robin Gibb and Bee Gees fan- a new album with 17 gorgeous songs!  I can't stop listening to this album, especially "Anniversary" and "Sanctuary"!

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.

Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

Amazon review:  If you don't like the first song this is not going to be a big deal, but I do have to say that I really like the first song.  I really like the music on this CD.  If you're not a fan of this (or any other) song then you probably won't enjoy the collection as a whole.  Overall, this CD is a great deal and I will probably buy it a second time for the same reasons.  If you want the whole collection to go with this first CD, then definitely buy this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD is a great deal for the price.  I love this album.  I love that it is about a band who, at the time, I had never heard of, and I love that it is a tribute to their music.  I also love that the songs are short, and some of them are catchy, and some of them are not.  The album is also filled with an array of great songs, and I love the fact that the songs are played in the order that they were written....which makes sense, since the band is from the late 70's, and that's when this album was written.  The CD is well worth the price, and I will definitely buy the album from Amazon.com again.

Amazon review: This CD has some of the best songs ever!  I have to say that I have been a huge Nirvana fan since I was a kid and this CD is like a trip down memory lane.  I love the fact that this CD is a tribute to their music.  I also love that most of their songs have been left off of the albums, so the fans don't have to wait around for them.  I especially love that the album is a tribute to one of their biggest fans, Kurt Cobain.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a fantastic CD.  I bought it to help me remember all the cool music I liked when I was a kid.  It is perfect.  The album has a great mix of songs, and the songs are short, which makes it more fun to listen to and also helps you get the point of the album faster.

Amazon review: Another fabulous CD from the Seattle based band.  I love this album, and I will be buying it again when I have the chance.  This is another great tribute to one of the most influential musicians of this generation.  I will buy this CD again, and also I will buy this CD again because I know it will be re-released.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is not a very bad CD.  It is not very good, but it is not bad.  I am not really sure why they are so bad.  It could be that the songs are not all that great, or it could be that the band has changed their sound since their first CD or it could be that they are just not very good musicians.  I do know that I would consider buying this CD, because it is so darn fun to listen to.  The songs are catchy and each one is different from the last, which is great.  You just have to have a sense of humor, and you will not be disappointed.

Amazon review: This is one of the best CDs I have listened to in a while.  I love how the guitar sounds on this CD are different from the guitar sounds I have heard on other CDs.

Amazon review: I love this CD.  This is a very good CD.  I am not a huge Nirvana fan, but I like this CD.

I have bought several CDs on Amazon and I have never had a problem with any of them.  This CD is in my opinion, a very good CD, and I will definitely buy it again.

Amazon review: This is by far my all time favorite Nirvana album.  I have heard every Nirvana album at least once, and this one stands out from the rest.  This is a very good tribute to Kurt Cobain, the man who was an influence on Nirvana.  This album has some of the best songs in Nirvana's catalog.  This album is fun to listen to.  I have never been one

Amazon review: The album is great so don't think the stars are for that. It gets lower star rating because it's censored. The sad thing is that the Amazon store kinda doesn't tell you this. When you buy a album uncut it will be labeled [explicit] but one that is clean has nothing like [censored] or [clean] next to it.  Jim Gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus I didn't think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album was done before he became a clean comic and as such as some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it.

Amazon review: I don't want to give a negative review here, but this book is very sexualized and thus I feel the book should be reviewed as a whole. The sex scenes are extremely graphic, yet the author claims the sexual scenes are all consensual. I also believe that some of the scenes are not consensual in nature. The sex is very graphic as well. The author also states that she is bisexual, yet she was not shown in any way having sex with anyone. I feel that she is only showing herself having sex with herself.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A lot of people will claim that the book is censored. I don't know why. Most of the scenes that are censored are the sex scenes. The book is very graphic in that it shows a lot of sex. The most graphic scene was a couple having sex. The only scene that was not censored was the same scene as it was shown in the movie The Devil Wears Prada. The actual scene was shown in the movie, but the scene was not shown in the book. It was shown in a deleted scene in the movie.  I don't know why it was censored in the book in the first place. Most of the censoring was done for the sex scenes and is not to censorship the book itself but only the sex scenes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: When you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over, then you know you've got a good album.  Eisley's unique sound is so soothing, refreshing, and at the same time slightly rockin. I'd say it sounds like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard, with girl vocals and beautiful harmonies that will definately send a chill down your spine. Like Stacy's "ahhs" on Marvelous Things and on Plenty of Paper. And in Brightly Wound where Stacy and Sherri sing two completly different verses and melodies at the same time and in  perfect harmony.

Amazon review: This CD is hilarious, i admit  there are some songs that aren't really funny, but theres always 1 or 2 bad songs on an album (in this one, the 1 bad track is "It happened in sun valley" that was a REALLY bad song). Also if you are easily offended by swearing, raciest remarks (don't worry its always in the interest of humor and always is funny) so if you are so devoted  to you religion that you would defend it in any way then don't buy this. But if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal Christmas songs then BUY THIS ALBUM

It was kind, and touching, and the song itself was great. Look for another year at Massey Hall, I am!

Amazon review: This is a great concert.  The setlist was changed by the radio station, but I'm glad they did.  The band was tight, and the singer was excellent.

I'm not going to give out any other names but I will say that the guy playing the guitar on that night was very good.

Amazon review: I love the music of this band.  I have several of their albums and have listened to them many times.

I have seen them many times at the Troubadour, and I have seen them many times at the House of Blues, and I have seen them many times at the House of Blues, but this was without a doubt the best.

The song choice is great.  The setlist is great.  And their performance was outstanding.  They have a reputation for playing well-sung, high-energy, rock songs.  But the first time I saw them, I was not expecting to like them.  I was expecting to hate them.  But then, when they played, it was amazing.  They were great.  My only complaint is that they did not play from the radio broadcast.  But again, I have gotten this album from CD, CD, CD, CD, CD, CD, CD, CD, and I have gotten it from tape, tape, tape, tape, tape, tape, tape, tape, and I have gotten it from cassette.  And, every time I have gotten it, it has been the best copy that I have ever received.  I think that this is the best CD that I have ever gotten.  It is the best copy of their CD that I have gotten.

I bought it. and also got two bonus tracks "Butterfly" and "Christmas Song" (for a total of 18) on this version. I'm very sorry to say that India's sophomore effort is jinxed. I have listened to it carefully about five times and nothing really stands out. The tracks become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyrics are extraordinarily sappy and preachy. The best song India has done aside from her first album is "Butterfly.

It is a very well produced album and has a good mix of the old and the new.  The best tracks are "Ramanavar" and "Door to Door".

Amazon review:  I bought this CD by mistake and was a little disappointed that it contained the same songs that were on the CD that I got for free.  I got the CD because it was on sale and I love songs by Simon & Garfunkel, but I would have preferred to have got the CD that came with the free CD I got as a gift from my parents.

Amazon review:  I downloaded this song and was really disappointed with the quality of the download.  The song I downloaded was the same song as the CD I bought.  The quality of the download, which was a 128kbps MP3, was far from good.  It sounds like it was copied from a cassette tape.  I will not be listening to the song for a long time due to the poor quality of the download.  I will not buy this song again.

Amazon review:  To me this was one of the worst songs of the year.  It is annoying because the music for the "where my heart goes" song is used in the final scene of the movie, "The Dark Knight Rises".  I don't know what the composer of the movie was thinking when they used the song.  The music to the movie was great but the song just sounded like a horrible version of "I'm so happy that you're mine" from the movie "Titanic".  The song is extremely repetetive.  The music in this song is repetitive and the lyrics are the same as the beginning of the song.  It is very annoying and I cannot stand it.  The only good thing about the song is that it is not in the movie.  I think this song should be banned.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I don't like this song.  It's not a happy song, it's more of a sad song.  It gets a little annoying when the song ends with the same "I'm such a lucky guy" at the end, but it's still fun.  I wish it would go away.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: No banjo. I was simply disappointed by the overall sound. I loved Mumford's first album, and thought the second one was just as good if not better. I was very excited to receive this CD the first day it came out, but after listening to it three times end to end, I felt bored. After the first week, I accidentally left it in the CD player of my rental car when I returned it, and made no effort to retrieve it. I hold out hope that the group makes a 4th album and moves back toward the sound that made the original two CDs so terrific.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart. But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices. Only One for Kanye was absolutely awful, and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with Kim Kardashian. Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them.

I like the songs a lot, but after a while you don't really care about the lyrics anymore because they become the same old stories, the same "you'll be there for me" (you know the song)? Some of the songs were really nice, but they were very similar to the old songs.
