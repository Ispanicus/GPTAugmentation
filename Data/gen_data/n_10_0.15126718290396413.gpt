The CD Baby link is broken (I've tried it before, and they never did anything for me), but the Amazon link is fine.

I found it to be the most fun CD I've ever purchased online, and I still have it today, though I have no idea how many songs there are on it. However, it's just a little bit over 500 pages for an album that has only three songs on it.

I found it to be the most fun CD I've never purchased before, and I'm still having fun with it today, though I don't know how many songs are on it.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am so pissed. This album is so boring and so unlistenable. I think I would rather listen to a few songs of the other artists I like. Seriously, you had to write a song with the word "dance" and then you had to drop the word "dance" to make it a song? No creativity there. I don't understand what the point was of the album and I'm seriously considering canceling my Amazon account.

Amazon review: I love this album. I've been following this artist for quite a while and I love his work. I liked his last two albums. I loved most of this album, but I have to say, I could've lived without the first half of the album. The second half is just average. A lot of songs that don't have any purpose. I can't really tell if the singer is even singing or just repeating himself. No real reason to listen to this album.
