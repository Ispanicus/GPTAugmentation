Amazon review: If you have watched the TV show, then you already know how catchy the songs are. The only difference between TV and the CD, is probably length. I haven't actually verified this, but it seems some of the songs on the CD are longer, and due to time constraints they shortened them on the show? Either way, a good time with good music.

Amazon review: When I first played this CD, I thought to myself that the singer did not sound like Johnny Rodriguez.  Then I looked at the cover of the CD and noted the following:  "All selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group."  Not sure what this is supposed to mean, but to me the singing does not sound like the Johnny Rodriquez that I am used to. Don't waste your money on this unless you like Johnny Rodriquez songs that sound like they are being sung by someone else.

Amazon review:  I purchased this CD and listened to it in the car while driving.  I got hooked on it.  I am impressed with the whole CD.  I am a fan of music.  I am not a big fan of heavy metal.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years, where her voice has lost its luster, and she really hasn't stopped for herself. Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course. I really did not find the song to deliver, as some of her earlier songs had. I really didn't find it to drive into the soul of the voice.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Rihanna is the new "it" girl. In the year 2010, the industry is going to explode with new and exciting artists. Rihanna has the musical ability to bring it; and I believe she is more than just a singer, she is the best at what she does. However, her voice is not for the faint of heart. She is a siren, and her voice should be heard on a beach, not in a studio. Rihanna is not a hit maker, she is a hit machine. I wish she would listen more to the rest of her music. Her voice is unique, and her songwriting is strong but I feel that her voice needs to be more versatile for her to have a career. Rihanna should stop trying to fit in on the "popular" music charts. She is very talented and could have a great career, but her voice needs to be more versatile. I feel that the music industry is the only place where she can showcase her talent.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love Rihanna... but I think she is one of the songs that is so "in love" with "her" voice that she cannot sing a song of "her" own.

My mom used to sing this song around the house, and I had searched for a long time for a recording (with words).

But, it would have been nice to have heard the tune of the verse.

The cellist, Dave Eggar, might be accomplished and all, but that doesn't really come across on this album. And if you're a fan of Amy Lee or Evanescence, there's nothing to see here. Amy's vocals appear on maybe 5% of the whopping 30 minutes the album plays for. The one song Amy wrote for the album, Push The Button, is easily the effort's worst track.

Amazon review: 0304 sees Jewel cross-over from her folk-country roots to pop. Laced with heavy beats and keyboards, this album fails to ignite and feels labored and intense. Whereas, Jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling, this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her. Her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful 'Intuition' making any mark on the listener. I love Jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me.

Amazon review: I don't know if this album is really worthy of a "Best Of" list. I do know I enjoyed it a lot. I guess I had to get into the mood. I don't know if I am really into her pop music, but I did enjoy listening to this album. I love the style of this album, the instrumentation, and the songwriting.

Amazon review: This is the second in a series of three albums to come out from her new label, Cactus Records, out of Dallas. The first one was an acoustic album called Let Go. The second one is a pop-tastic album called I Don't Wanna Be Alone. This album features three of Jewel's biggest hits, "I'm Still There," "So Beautiful" and "I Don't Wanna Be Alone."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was excited about this album when it was announced, and I was even more excited when I heard it. I didn't think it was going to be good, but I was wrong. I fell in love with this album and started buying it on CD. Then I started buying it on vinyl. Now I own all vinyl versions of this album. I have never been more happy in my life. This is a wonderful album. This is the perfect album for me.

I can't believe I waited so long to get this album and I feel like I belong on the album now.

If Metallica decided to drop the electric guitars and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be Metallica.  If a bluegrass band switched to trombones and tubas it wouldn't be bluegrass.  When U2 decided to go electronica on their Pop album it sucked.  That's what this is.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review: This composition, while ambitious and promising at certain points, never really takes off.  The composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instruments, but doesn't go anywhere with it.  The themes never develop, and the variations aren't all that different from each other.  I had high hopes for the coda as it seemed that the piece was building to a satisfying conclusion, but it was just more of the same.  I do detect some possibilities that his future work may go in some new directions, however.

Amazon review: Alright, this song is actually so horrible that I couldn't help myself from writing a review.  It consists of minimal beats on an MPC that a 5 year old most likely did.  The most annoying part of the song is the repeated "You don't know!" that plays over and over again to imply the listener didn't hear it the first 3 times.  The final "You don't know!" ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer.  Don't throw away your money, and if it's on the radio change the station!

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart. But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices. Only One for Kanye was absolutely awful, and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with Kim Kardashian. Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them.

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

Amazon review: I have been a Xtina fan since her "Genie in a Bottle" days. I was a teen when she first came out so I kinda feel like I've "grown up" with her music. First off, her voice is absolutely amazing. Some people may not consider her 'iconic' but her voice is one in a million. Most people that came up around Christina's time don't even compare in vocal range. She had such a big voice for a pop star who didn't get a chance to really show off her skills or her real personality with her first album.

Amazon review: This is my least favorite song of Ryan Leslie's to date. I don't really like it because it is not a good song, but I don't really hate it. I like the song, but it is a little annoying because of the lyrics. I do like the music because it is catchy.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Christina, and I am a big fan of the first album that she put out, "Hella". I was one of the first people to learn about her music, and her songs are just amazing.

I am a big fan of her voice and I am a big fan of her music.

Amazon review: I am glad that I don't hate on Ryan Leslie. I do like his music and I do like his second album, "Diamond Girl". I think that his music and his style is unique and creative. I don't think that he needs to take a backseat to Christina, but I do think that he needs to step up his game.

Amazon review: Lin Manuel is a world-renowned singer-songwriter whose songs are instantly recognizable but have remained largely unknown for decades. The songs of Lin Manuel Miranda are as popular with audiences as they are with musicians. Miranda's songs have been broadcast on television's The Today Show, Good Morning America, and The CBS Evening News, and are frequently featured in news magazines such as Time and Newsweek. The songs have been recorded by artists including Whitney Houston, Patti LaBelle, Garth Brooks, The Jackson Five, Bonnie Raitt, Celine Dion, and James Taylor. Many of his songs have been recorded by American Idol winner Randy Jackson, who first heard Miranda perform at a sold-out concert in New York in 1997.

The songs are nice and most of them are very good. The problem is that the lyrics are written in such a way that they sound like they are about a person who is in love with a boy, and the girl he loves hates him. I have to wonder if they really mean what they say. There are songs with great music and great lyrics, but there are others that are mediocre at best. The album could be an 8 or 9. I would definitely recommend this cd to someone who has a good ear for music.

Sentiment:"The Beatles are a bunch of old farts who have been around since the early 1960's and have seen better days. They can't write a song and they can't get a girl.

Amazon review: I have given a few copies of the CD and Guide to family and friends because it brings one closer to the Blessed Mother and in touch with the Lord.

Amazon review: Adam's voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable.  His second album was the best - he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs.  The material is weak and the lyrics are laughable.  This is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream "pop" star.  He was never that - his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words.  His interpretation of classics on American Idol (Mad World, Tracks of My Tears), made the songs his own.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Susan is an excellent vocalist with a wonderful voice.  I have heard her on a couple of local radio shows and her voice is always very expressive and has great range.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years, where her voice has lost its luster, and she really hasn't stopped for herself. Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course.

Amazon review: I don't understand why Adam wants to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hacks in the pop scene today.  He's a cut above in the vocal department - he doesn't need to do this.  I'm not a fan of his song selections and the direction he's gone in his career, with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock, where he shines, in my opinion.  But, I adore him and his fearlessness.  He's obviously doing what he loves and just because it doesn't resonate with me doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was looking for a new album to add to my collection and this one fit the bill.  I'm quite happy with it.  I love the song selection and the production.

I appreciate some of them but some are just so poor it's insulting.

I particularly enjoyed the sound of a man from the 16th century bewailing all of the 'progress' and 'newfangled fashions', which is very English.  I will definitely buy his next album or two.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've been listening to Mr. Adam Phillips since 1990.  I first heard him on the radio and then discovered his music on the internet.  I've always loved his music and always will.  I find his music very challenging and enjoyable and I love his style.  He's an incredible singer and his songs are absolutely beautiful.  I've been trying to find a way to add his music to my collection for quite some time.  This collection is a wonderful mix of his songs, and it's great to know that his music is here for us to enjoy.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.

Amazon review: I've never heard of this artist before, but I was completely convinced by his voice.  It's the best I've ever heard.  I agree.  It's a great mix of 'common songs' from merry England.  I particularly loved the sound of a man from the 16th century bemoaning all the progress and 'newfangled fashions' that were destroying the heart, mind and soul, or Adam's, of England.  I'm very happy.  I enjoyed this purchase and I love Adam's voice.  He sings and writes amazing songs.  This is the first time I've bought any of his albums or tracks.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.

Amazon review: I'm sure that the Tom Waits purists have a specific album or two to suggest, but this one does the trick for me.  I've been more than a casual fan since he appeared on "Fernwood Tonight" and sang "The Piano Has Been Drinking".  Tom's version of "Jersey Girl" (the original) can't be beat.  "The Heart of Saturday Night"?  Nothing really needs to be said.  If you want to try Tom Waits on for size, starting here isn't a bad idea.  Great stuff.

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.  Jason's lyrics express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life, rather than dwelling on the past.  The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: There are a few songs here that are pretty good.  It is a very different approach from the more standard rock I would expect from a band like this.  But the songwriting is decent.  They have good harmonies and well done instrumentation.  The vocal performance is on the weak side.  They are trying too hard to sound like they are singing from the front of a choir.  They have a nice vocal melody but the lyrics don't really flow together.  The instrumentation is very good.  But the vocals are still a little on the thin side.  The only saving grace is the lead guitar playing by Keith Flint who is the best lead rock guitar I have heard in a long time.
