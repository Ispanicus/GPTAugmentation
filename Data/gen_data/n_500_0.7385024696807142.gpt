Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

I don't know how many of you out there enjoy the radio station "MOR ROTH".  I was excited to hear that their new CD comes out on this station, so I was prepared to like it.  I did not like it at all!  The songs are dull, the music is old and the lyrics are predictable.  I'm not sure what I thought was going to happen to the lyrics of this album.  I was hoping for a lot of great songs but I only heard the same songs over and over again.  The songs are not bad, maybe the best songs on the album are "Fate is Calling" and "I'm Not the One".  The CD is definitely worth listening to but in my opinion, this is not an album I should have purchased.  I thought it would be an interesting album but it was just not.  I don't think I've ever heard a CD that I didn't like but this one was just not for me.  There was one song with great lyrics, "I'm Not the One" but that song was repeated over and over and over again.  For the price of this CD, I would have liked to have heard it twice.  I don't know what happened here.  I don't know if they are just trying to be different and not let listeners know what they are doing and it's not for them, or if the market will swallow them up...or if they are just trying to sound better than the competition.  I'll have to listen to the CD again if they come out with another one.  I would have preferred a more commercial CD, but even that would have been more disappointing.  I don't like this at all.  I don't know if it's the label or Kelly Price, but I don't think this CD will sell.

Amazon review: I found this a bit interesting but it definitely doesn't deserve a four and a half star rating. It's a nice listen though.  I like the fact that Kelly Price has a new album, but I just don't like it.  It's too repetitive.  I found most of the songs to be boring.  There's one song that has a very catchy chorus, but the rest of the songs are all so boring.  I don't know if it's because Kelly Price's voice is too high for this CD or not, but it just doesn't sound good.  I found that the songs were not very catchy and it didn't make me feel good at all.  The only song I really liked was "Fate is Calling", but it didn't even get a single star from me.  I would have liked to have heard more songs on this CD, but as it stands, it's not my favorite album.  I'll stick with the CDs I've bought from her in the past and I'll continue to buy the CDs she puts out.  It's not a bad CD, but it's not my cup of tea.  There are a few good songs on it, but I don't think it's worth the price of the CD.  If you like Kelly Price, then you might as well wait for her next album.  It's not worth buying.  I would recommend not buying this

Amazon review: Not the best album in the world, but it'll do just fine.  I'm kinda sick of Slipknot being lumped into the same category as a lot of bands.  Not that I don't like their music, but they just seem to be trying to be too many different things at once and it seems like they're trying to be a bunch of different types of bands.  My only two complaints about the album are the lyrics of "The Devil You Know" and the music of "Crawl".  That's about all I can say.  I guess we'll just have to wait for the next one.

They are my favorite band and I'm glad I got the chance to listen to this.

Amazon review: I don't know what the hell is wrong with people.  They think they are going to be big by putting a video up at some point (a video that is more than a minute long).

Amazon review: I'm really not a fan of this album.  It sounds like a band that has never played together before.  Some of the songs are catchy, but I think they should have used some other songs in the album instead of most of them.  The only redeeming factor for this album is that it is actually better than the last album.  I think it's a little too long, but it's still an enjoyable listen.  I don't usually listen to a lot of metal, but I'm glad I bought this album because it's definitely a good listen.

Amazon review: This album is a great listen.  My only complaint is the lack of variety in the songs, but that's minor when the songs themselves are really good.  I do wish they used a different song in the intro for "The Devil You Know".  I don't know why they're trying to be like a bunch of different bands here.

Amazon review: This album sounds exactly like Slipknot to me.  I don't understand why people hate this album so much.  It's a good album, but I wish they would have put a video somewhere on the site to explain the songs better.  I like the fact that they are trying to do something different and the songs are catchy.  I think the album is a good listen, but I wish they would have put a better explanation on the website for the songs.  It would have been better if they had used other songs in the album.  I do think they are trying to do so many different things that they are just going to confuse people.

I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I like the cover.  It is not something that will be put on the rack often.  The only thing I like more is that it is on a small sleeve, and a small cardboard box with the band's face on.  But I will enjoy if people can find it in their local record store.  I like the title track too.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The CD was not worth the money, but I am glad I bought it.  This CD is a tribute to Jimi Hendrix, and is a great song selection.  As is the cover with Jimi's face on it.  I am glad it is not sold out, even though I am not sure how it fits in with the other CD's that are sold out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The CD was a complete waste of money, and in reality, is not a "tribute" to Hendrix, it's just a cover album that they did for a few songs that they didn't have time to record.  The only song I like is "Rise to the Occasion", but I don't remember it.  The song selection is not very good.  There are 4 songs that are cover songs, and one that is a song by one of the members of the band.  It is hard to tell if it is a cover, and it is a mystery why they did this because there isn't much to it.  The guitar solo does not work on the song and I don't know why.  I would have preferred the songs that were recorded by the band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't listened to it yet, but I am a fan of this band.  I have heard of their music, but have never heard them, so I was happy to see the CD in the store.

I am glad they did a record for this CD, but it is all just a cover.  I really don't buy their CDs (even the first one), but I would buy this CD if it was a good CD.  I don't have anything negative to say about this CD.  It is a good CD, and I really like the cover.

Amazon review: The CD is a poor album.  I was happy to see it in the store.  I like their music, but the CD is more of a cover album.  The album is not worth the money, I don't like the album, which is all I have to say about it.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times.  I like it, but it is not worth the money.  The best song is "We'll Meet Again", which is on the CD.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  There are some great songs on here, but unfortunately there isn't much of a mix.  It's a shame because there are some excellent songs on here.  Like I said, this is a great album.  The band is amazing, and I love the vocals of Amy Millan.

Amazon review: This album had a lot going for it, but unfortunately it was a bit over hyped by the press.  The best song is "The Great Divide" and the worst is the song "A Long Way to Go."  The "A Long Way to Go" is just an ugly song, and you don't want it on your record.  The other songs are good, but I believe the best is the song "The Great Divide."

Amazon review: This is an excellent tribute to the music of The Byrds, The Band, and The Band's great friend, Gram Parsons.  The only thing I will say is that the vocals are not as good as the other two albums, but they are still very good all the way around.  The music is great, and the lyrics are also very good.  This album is definitely listenable.  The songs are great and the singing is very good.  If you like the other two albums, you will probably like this one.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think that these are just songs that the label wanted to have made available for everyone to hear, and there is no such thing as a "slam-dunk" or an original hit. There are a few that I remember from the '90s, but they are not really hits or in any way unique. The only one that really stands out to me is "You Don't Have Me" by Mariah Carey, which I think is one of the most underrated hits of that era.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have always been a fan of the music and the way that the artists expressed themselves. I think this is a great album.  I think it would be a mistake to discount it because it was made by the same company that made "The Dolly Parton Collection" - which was also a great album.  The first CD has some great songs, but this one has some great songs, too.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the album, but I know what the people who made it are going to say.  They are just going to say that it's a re-issue of an album that was sold long ago.  They will think it's overrated and will give a negative review.  I think that most of the songs are good, but it would be a mistake to give this album a 10/10 because it sounds like an updated version of "The Essential Dolly Parton" which was released in 1993. That's not to say that it isn't good, because it is. It's probably the best album of the '90s that was on the market at the time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have never heard of this artist, but I like her music.  I bought this album because I wanted to find a song that I had forgotten.  This album has a few songs that I remember.  "You Don't Have Me" by Mariah Carey is one.  I think I was only twelve when I first heard "You Don't Have Me" and went back and bought the CD in the store.  I have never been able to buy that song again.  I remember when I was a little girl, my dad bought me "You Don't Have Me" and I loved it.  I thought that it was just a girl's song, but I loved it so much that I bought the CD to play it over and over again.  I never heard the song again until, years later, I happened to be at the beach and was listening to a CD in the car and came across this.  I couldn't believe that the song was still there.  I felt as if I had remembered it.  I have always liked the song, but I never knew it was a country song until a few years ago.  I love the song, but I don't think that it is country.  I just thought that it was a nice song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times now, and I have not had any problems hearing the songs.  I have listened to this album numerous times and the songs never get old.  I like the album, but I know that people who are not familiar with country music will not like it.  I have listened to this album several times from the beginning, and I can't seem to remember all of the songs which is a good thing, because I like to hear a new song every time I listen to this album.  My only complaint is that there are a few songs on the album that I have not heard before, and I could not recall them and they are gone.  I just don't know if I should buy this album because I don't like it.  The songs would be better if it was just a compilation of all the songs that I remember.  Other than those few songs, I would not have any problem with the album.

It's a good album but I don't know if I should buy it.  I would much rather buy any CD or album in the store because I like to hear new music.

I thought it was a good cover and I really enjoyed the song, not to mention the fact that it's the only song on the album that I like. This one is not worth the price of shipping.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not sure I'd call it a "cover" because it's not a straight copy of anything. As I said before, I really enjoyed the sound and I thought the song was catchy, but you're right, that's not what it is. I guess when you're in a band it's hard to make another song sound like the previous one without changing the instrumentation or the style of the lyrics. I mean, I'm sure the band members would have preferred it if they had their own original songs. I guess this is the next best thing to working in a band, huh? I'd give this a 3.5 out of 5 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's not an original song, but it's a cover of the Pink Floyd song "Money" from the album of the same name. It's not bad, it's just kind of forgettable in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's an amazing, almost perfect cover, but you can tell it's not supposed to be a cover. I like "Dead Man Walking" better, but this is a far superior version of a song that has been covered many times. The band sounds fantastic, the song is very well played, and the lyrics do a nice job of tying the whole album together.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's one of the greatest covers of all time. I love the song, as I do the album. It's very original and has the ability to get stuck in your head for hours.

Amazon review: I will never forget this song. Never. The first time I heard "Wasting All Their Love", it was a huge mistake. I had to go back to the VHS of the movie "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" to find out what the song was about. It's a huge mistake to think that a cover of a Pink Floyd song will be any less great.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.
