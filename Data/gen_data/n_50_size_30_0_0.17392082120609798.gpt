Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I've only purchased this album once and it was by mistake. I didn't want to waste my money thinking I was just going to buy this album, so I bought it by mistake. I've since gone back to it and I am glad I did. I've listened to it a few times and have not gotten bored with it. The music is very smooth and catchy and I've gotten into it without having to look up the lyrics to a song to understand it. It has some good songs on it and a few bad ones. Overall I would suggest to anyone looking to buy this album to just buy it and enjoy it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: First of all I love this song. I can't imagine you ever say anything bad about Twiztid. This is a song that I will always remember. I'm not a big rap person but I am a huge fan of hip hop and Twiztid is one of my favorites.

Amazon review: This song makes me smile. It always makes me smile when I play it over and over in my head. I have the new album on vinyl and the original album on CD and I just love the album. I don't know why I don't buy more music because it is so much fun. It's almost kind of like playing a game and you can't lose.

Amazon review: I love the song. I don't know why I'm not buying the album anymore. I've been listening to it since I was a teenager and it's always something that brings me happiness. I've only had it for a few days and I already feel like I've known this song for a very long time.

Amazon review: I listen to this song almost every day. It brings a smile to my face. My life has been great and I'm glad I made the choice to not let it go. I listen to this song while I'm working out, in the shower, driving, eating, or when I'm just sitting at home. I just love this song.

Amazon review: I am an avid fan of "I'll make you a star" by D-Block & the Stuntmasters. I used to hate this song, but once I found it on the Internet, I became a fan. I enjoy the song very much.

Amazon review: I've only listened to this album a few times and I have to say that I'm becoming a Twiztid fan. It's a good album that you can listen to while you ride your bike, while you're working out, or even while you're watching a movie. I've only listened to the album once and I can't see any reason why I'd try to listen to it more.

Amazon review: I've just been listening to this for a few days now, and it's a great album. I love the album because it's very enjoyable.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I have been trying to get a better night's sleep since I began taking melatonin on a regular basis.  When this cd was played, I felt more relaxed and at peace than I have in weeks.  I was able to fall asleep.  I am now going to buy this cd for my husband to try to help him sleep better and this will be the first cd he has purchased.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD was purchased new by the way and the price was way too high.  I love to listen to this type of music and this is not it.  The only song played here that I like  is "Mushroom" and it works well.  The majority of the songs are dull and boring.  I give this a 1 rating.

Amazon review: I was a little hesitant when I first saw this CD, because it looked like I would be purchasing a collection of mostly contemporary classical music.  However, after I listened to this CD, I was quite pleased by what I heard.  I was initially a little disappointed at how repetitive the songs were, but after I had it over with, I realized that a lot of the songs were repetitive and nothing new or exciting.  Some of the songs sounded like a choir with instruments, which I thought was a little odd.  If the songs were a little more interesting, then there would be some more variety within the songs, but because of the repetitive nature of some of the songs, there was very little to distinguish them.  The CD is very good, but not that great.  I give this a 2 rating.

Amazon review:  After listening to this CD for about half an hour, I felt like I was in a different world.  What I heard was just amazing, and I was really impressed by the artists abilities.

Amazon review: We love our songs, and we love the music of J.S. Bach.  My son and I listened to this CD, and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was interesting to hear a Bach vocal track.  His voice was so pure and beautiful.  He had a lot of energy and was able to express himself through the piece.  My son was able to hear Bach's works in a way that I could never do.  This is one of the best CDs for the kids.  My son also enjoyed the music on the CD, and I thought it would be good to keep him entertained.  I do not think I could play this CD for my own use, but it will be a fun and educational experience for my son.  I give this CD a 3 rating.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD at my local music store.  The CD is very good.  I'm not sure I'd go so far as to call it "classical", but this is not your typical boring collection of choral songs.

Amazon review: I was searching for a classical music CD for my brother and I was pleased to learn that this one is available.  I bought it at my local music store.  I like the arrangement of the pieces, but the way the pieces are written make me question how many classical pieces were written by more than one person.  It took me about 5 minutes to get through all of the songs.  The ones I didn't like were the ones where the arrangement of the choral sound is just a bunch of different instruments playing the same notes.  I would have like to hear one piece that had a lot more variety in the arrangement of the choral instruments.  I give this CD a 2 rating.

I hope he comes back and releases another album.  It is definitely worth listening to even if you can't download the music.  It is in a different style then most of the mainstream Christian music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

After listening to a few songs I gave it a thumbs up, but I did not buy this CD right away.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Not only is this a very good recording of the music, but it is a nice listen to the music itself.  The recording is very nice without the music sounding too much like a recording.

Amazon review: If you like Johnny Cash, you will love this.  I was a little disappointed that I was only given CD #1, but I'm hopeful that CD #2 will be better quality.  Overall, this is a good album. It's not one of those "hey, you didn't know Johnny Cash used this kind of music? And I didn't know this guy was a musician?" kind of album, but for some reason, I love listening to his stuff.  I highly recommend this one to anyone who likes Johnny Cash.

Amazon review: It would have been a great album to get, but I'm glad I didn't.  I have several CDs and this is the only one I'm really interested in listening to, and it's not one of his best.  He does sound a little weird to me, but I'll admit that I'm not the most sophisticated of music fans.  I guess I just don't like his music that much, but I'm glad I didn't get this.

Amazon review: This album would have been great to have a second CD, because the bonus CD is a lot more songs than the CD.  I like his music, but I don't like his approach.

It's not just because of the songs, It's because the CD is so much more appealing than it's predecessor CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I love this song but, it is so annoying.  Like, it is so annoying and has no redeeming qualities, that is the only way I can describe it.  The other songs on the playlist that were not annoying as I thought were a little better.

This song is so annoying.  I love this song but, it is so annoying.  Like, it bugs me and it is so annoying that I couldn't listen to it for more than 5 minutes.  The other songs on the playlist that were not annoying as I though were a little better.

So annoying

The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed that it's not on here.  I like the songs I have on here that are not annoying.  So I guess I have to give this one a 3 star rating.

I will listen to this album again!

I love this album, but I had to turn it off for a few minutes because it was so boring.  I will listen to it again.  It is really good, but it is too repetitive.  I like the other songs, but this one is the only one I will continue to listen to.  It's a shame that there isn't more songs on this album.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: No one can be sure about this album. I am a fan of the band and the album but I am not a fan of these particular songs.  After the first two songs I was starting to like them, but the third song  was just too much and I just could not listen to it any longer, I had to stop it.  The first two songs are good, but the third just seems to be bad.  They are very repetitive, and some of the songs seem to repeat and not flow well.  The last song  is pretty good, although I have to disagree with the opinion that they sound like they were recorded in the 1960's.   I would not call the music of "Ladies and Gentlemen" old timey at all, if anything it sounds a lot more modern.    Very generic, but fun.    I'm not sure what the problem with this album is.  I really liked the first two, and the third is good, but I just don't know why they keep repeating this bad album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: There was not many songs on this album.  The first two are all good, the third one was bad.   I just don't want to listen to this album again.

I just feel like this is just a collection of good songs, with a few bad songs mixed in.  Don't waste your time, this is just ok.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I saw an ad for the album and was excited to hear it and get a chance to review it.   It was nice to get a chance to compare it to the other albums by Meghan Trainor.  I really enjoyed the new songs, but, I am very disappointed with this CD.  In general, I don't think this album is the best effort by Meghan Trainor.  I think it is more of a "meh" (not quite a meh or a dud) album.  I don't know if this is because of the songwriting or the production or the mix or what.  I'm not a big fan of Meghan Trainor's music, but I am a fan of the other 3 acts that she is not in the band with.  I guess I just don't see the passion for the songs.  I feel it is a let down because the songs are simple and not very interesting.  I think the new songs are ok, but, I just don't think they are very good.  I don't understand why she had to change the style of music.  I think it is an original and unique style, but, why did she have to change it?  I think the first song, "All of Me" is a good song, but, the other 4 songs are not very good.  After one listen, I can't help but think that the songs just sound like they are written by someone that doesn't really like the music.  I am not saying that Meghan Trainor doesn't have talent, but, the songs just sound generic and boring.  I would have rather had one of the songs be a little more original and the other 4 not very good.  I don't think that the songs are bad, but, they just don't sound very good.  On the other hand, I did enjoy the album.  I think that if you really enjoy any of the other 3 artists, you would probably enjoy this as well.  I just don't think this is a great album.  This is the second album in which Meghan Trainor has changed the style of music.  She is not in the band anymore with the original three.  I am not sure why she has to change it, but, I can't help but think that it is a little bit of a let down.  I just want to know why these songs are not good.  It seems a little repetitive.  The songs are like they are written by someone who doesn't really like the songs.  I really don't understand why she had to change it.  On the other hand, I really liked the album.  I thought the songs were original and different and I thought the album was great.  I think it was perfect for my tastes.  I think that if I was to buy this album, I would like it.  I still liked the first album, but, I just think this album is not as good as the first.   I will not buy it again, but, I will listen to it again.  I just think it is a let down.  I think the first album was better, but, it just seems like this album just isn't as good as the first.  I would rather have the original three in the band and not have to hear one more band.  I don't understand it, but, I just don't like it.  I think the original three in the band is better.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed it and thought it was wonderful.  I would have been much more impressed if Meghan had taken a more creative approach and not been afraid to take risks.  I don't know if I would be as interested in more of her songs like "All of Me" or "No Rain" or "Someday."  I really liked "All of Me," but, I don't think the new songs are great.  I think the new songs are very similar to the old ones and that really annoys me.  I don't want to hear any more songs that sound like they were written by a 12-year-old.  I just don't know why she has to change the style of music.  The new songs are nothing to write home about.  I just think the songs are generic and boring.

I don't understand how they can say things such as, "the black man is so lazy," "the black man is so ignorant," and "the black man is so stupid and so worthless" as if being black is bad.  It's not.  It's just as black as being white or as being a person who has two thumbs instead of four.  But anyway, I've listened to this album so many times I've almost forgotten how it makes me feel.

Because Rapper's Delight is about rap and it's about being black and it's about being a rapper.  This album is just rap and that's it.  It's about the rapper being "lazy" and "ignorant."  It's about the rapper saying, "I ain't no hater" but then he comes out with some "nigga speak."  It's about the rapper being "stupid" and "worthless."  It's about the rapper saying, "the black man is a joke" but then he comes out with "the black man is a failure" and then he says, "the black man is a gang-stalkin'" and "the black man is a gang-stalker."  I just don't like the message that is in this album.  I don't like the lyrics at all.  I don't like the music.  I don't like the album.  I don't like the songs.  I don't like the album.
