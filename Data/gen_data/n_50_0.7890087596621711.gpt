Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

If you like old time music you will like this CD.  It has a great sound.  The lyrics are excellent.  If you like old time music or old time music with a little blues flavor this is a great album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I love the vocals and guitars and the whole recording just felt like a band was playing in there.  The whole thing is very energetic and they have a great sound.  While at first, I thought that this was a more straight based metal album, it's not.  It is a mixture of heavy metal, thrash, and some of the best rock and roll I have heard in a long time.  "Fatal Vision"  is the best song on the album.  I love the way the guitars sound in this song. It's just plain cool.  "Cemetery"  is the first song that I heard on the CD.  I was hooked on this song right off the bat.  It is a great song with a great guitar solo.  "Killing Machine"  is a great song that has a lot of energy in it.  The guitars sound fantastic.  The lyrics are awesome.  "The Devil's Rain"  is another great song.  This is one that I never thought would make it to the CD.  This song is a fun and fast song with a great guitar solo.  It's a great song and I have listened to it over and over.  I still love "The Devil's Rain"  because of the guitar solo.  This song is a great song that is on the CD and I hope to hear more from this band.  I love their style of music.

I went to Amazon and was shocked to find that the album cost $19.99 but was only listed on Amazon as a 99 cent price. The album had a lot of tracks. That said, it is a beautiful album and worth it's price.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

For the most part I really like the songs. I can't say that I am a big fan of Madrox and I know that I am not.  The songs are very good, and I like to listen to hip hop music, and the music on this song is very hip hop.  I can't say that I like Madrox much, but I do like the song.  The song is very nice and I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes hip hop and rap music. If you don't like hip hop or rap music then you probably won't enjoy this album.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes hip hop music.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review:  I found this CD last week, and I am not sure I have ever listened to a Christian band more than I have on this album.  It is clear with the songs that there is a message, but I am not sure what it is, but I find that I believe God answers prayer in ways that we cannot see.  If this is your first time listening to this album, do not waste your time, go and buy the whole album.  I am amazed at how well the songs go together.  Also, I find the lyrics very poetic.  The album is very well done.  I was impressed with the music, the lyrics, and the musicianship.  I am amazed that this is the first Christian CD I have heard that I am not embarrassed to listen to.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I am not an opera fan and  this one was the first one that I had ever seen.  I am not saying that I am not an opera fan.  I am just saying that I have not ever seen an opera that was not amazing, and this is an all around amazing piece of music.  I can listen to it all day.  It is a perfect opera and I highly recommend that you take the time to listen to this opera.  It is a great opera and a great opera.

Amazon review: For those of you who are unaware of this band,  this band consists of two  people, a guitarist and a vocalist.  These two  people come from the area that once was known as "Little Rock" which is now known as "Arkansas."  Little Rock is where John Lennon grew up and it is where the Beatles were created.  They were a tight  and a close knit family.  Their father was a preacher and they raised their three children with this kind of life style.  Little Rock is where this band comes from.  They come from the same neighborhood as the Beatles and they are also the same age.  The two members of this band are the "brothers" of John Lennon's wife,  Jane Asher, who wrote this album. The band members also wrote songs for this album and they have performed them in concerts.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of classical music, but in recent years I have been enjoying a more contemporary style of music.  I am a musician myself, so I know what it is like to work hard to create music that is enjoyable for others.  That is what I wanted to do as a musician.  I had been wanting to learn more about the blues, but not being a blues fan, I was very reluctant to pursue the subject.  I finally discovered open your mouth and sing, and found that it was not only great for learning to sing, but also an excellent way to learn about the blues.  The instructor, Cyney Davis, has a wonderful voice and a very good approach to learning.  The quality of the songs and the sound quality of the recording makes her voice almost overwhelming.  I have found that I am able to learn much more of the song than I thought possible.  I am also able to really listen to some of her voice and learn from it.  I have found that the recording quality is very good.  The instruction is very clear and understandable.

Amazon review: I have learned a lot about the blues from the Open Mouth and Sing CD.  I have been learning to play the guitar for over thirteen years, and I've been singing ever since I was a child.  I have been enjoying learning to sing so much more since I started to listen to this music.  I have always loved to sing, but I always avoided it at first because I didn't want to embarrass myself.  This CD has helped me to overcome that fear and I am now able to sing with my friends in a group setting.  It has been a

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: First of all, listen to the instruments.  The instruments in this CD should be played by the musicians themselves, not by an electric keyboard.  But, the instruments sound great, and they do not suck.  The guitar playing is also great.  The vocals are not great.  There is a great selection of songs, but it is not a good selection.  I would suggest not buying this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: A truly amazing record for the 80's.  While some people will be disappointed with this album, I am very happy to say I am one of those people.  It's not a concept record.  It's not a soundtrack to a movie.  It's not an opera.  It's an album.  It's a whole album.  If you look at the lyrics, you will see the influences of the 60's, 70's and 80's.  Some people will hate that this is not your typical rock album.  I say, "Good."  The songs are very well composed and have a great flow.  Some of the best lyrics were "I need you like a hole in the head."  I'm not sure how many of the people who loved this album will have one song on the top of the charts, but you will hear this album on the radio.  The music is not "rock."  It's more like a mix of some of the best songwriters of the 70's (and in some songs, 80's).  There's nothing wrong with that.  It's not a "rock" album.  It's more like a mix of some of the best songwriters in the 80's.  Rock music is a dead genre.  It doesn't need to be.  But, I'm a sucker for rock.  When I listen to a song, I can't help but want to buy it.  I love that song.  The lyrics, the music and Danzig are all amazing.

However, the problem with this album is that I got side tracked.  I have to get back to listening to the songs while reading the lyrics.  I don't understand a song like "Good, Bad & Ugly" or "I Wanna..."  It's just really annoying.  I like it when the music is just for the songs and not distracting me.

I think it's because I'm just not a fan of Meghan Trainor.  She is amazing and I love her music, but my husband's dad and I are not big fans of her music.  We are not big fans of her rapping. I also don't listen to rap music very often.  I just can't get into this track.  I just can't get into her music.  I can't say anything bad about her music just because I'm not a fan.
