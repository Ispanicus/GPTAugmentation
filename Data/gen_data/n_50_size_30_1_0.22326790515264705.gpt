Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: A very good cd with a lot of songs in it. I was not surprised with the "Canciones de la noche" track but I found a lot of stuff in this cd that I had not heard before.  The only thing I don't like is that the song "Otra vez" (Another Time) doesn't have a chorus.  I'm not a big fan of ballads so I don't know what the difference is.  I'm sure there is a lot of people that don't like ballads so I'm not that surprised.  I'm sure people will enjoy this cd.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Their CD is an all time favorite.  I've bought Revel's CD on CD and I just love it.  The CD is full of wonderful music.  I'm looking forward to buying the CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was a good deal for the price and I will say that I am not a fan of opera. I did not like it. But, I will say that this album is a terrific representation of "The Marriage of Figaro" and the music is so lovely that the voices are perfect and the orchestra is superb. I like this version of the music, but I have to say, that when I first heard it I was amazed because I have never heard it sung with this orchestra before.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When I first encountered "The Marriage of Figaro" I thought it was a romanticized version of the love of Figaro and his wife, Figli. I am not surprised that the opera that this album was based on was not received as well as it should have been. I am not a fan of opera, but this was an excellent album, and I was very happy with the purchase.

Amazon review: I have not listened to this album on many (if any) occasions. When I do listen to it, it always stays in my mind. One of the reasons I bought this CD was to hear the arias from this opera. I can't believe I have not bought this work yet. Why? Because it is not the sort of opera that I would have ever wanted to hear (the "The Marriage of Figaro" is a very romantic and sentimental work). The only reason I bought this album was because I saw the video on the internet and I was intrigued by it. I'm a sucker for any sort of video on the internet, so of course I bought it. Now I cannot listen to it until I get home and listen to it.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of this opera. I am not sure why I chose it to listen to. I probably would not have bought a work of any kind, but I bought this because I saw the video on the internet and loved it. I am not sure why I like it, but I do. It is a very nice piece of music.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It's clear that he cares about the music enough to put a lot of work into it.   This is a well-crafted work and I am very pleased with what I heard.  It is a wonderful CD, and I think it will find a place in my heart.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is an album with great singing, lyrical and musical talent. The singer is very good at singing different types of songs and playing different instruments. The best part is the lyrics. They are not the usual kind of lyrics that you can read off of a page of a book. Those are just songs that you can sing. This album is very enjoyable to listen to. If you like the jazz, I highly recommend it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I told him that the lyrics are about him being a cop and being called that by the community.  He got a kick out of that.  He has a lot of anger in his life and he has to channel that through music.  I told him that when we were on the road he would get angry about the things that he saw because he was so mad and that he would call me because he needed to vent.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I like this CD, it has some good tracks, but the songs are just repetitive, almost annoying, or have no real point to them. A couple of songs I really like, but I am not a big fan of the song selection, they seem to be there just so they could have a few good tracks on the CD. This is not a bad CD, but I would rather listen to something on a CD that has a more complete and focused song selection.

Amazon review: It's good to hear something different from Meghan.  She sounds like she's having a good time on the recording.  The music is good.  But the singing is a little more off than I like.  I don't like how the song starts out by having a loud, heavy, drumbeat.  Then the vocals get softer, more of a whisper and a whisper is what it really is.  I don't like how it ends.  It's not good.

Even though I like the song "All About That Bass" and the song "Girlfriend," I'm not going to buy the CD.  I don't like these songs.  They're just not for me.  I don't know why, I just don't like the songs.  It's just the song that I don't like.

It's what you have been hearing since the beginning.  It's not going to change, and even if it did,  you're not going to get any better.  I hope you don't think you're going to get better.

Amazon review:
This is not a good performance. It's a great voice, but this is a poor performance. In fact, the performance is terrible. He sounds like he's barely able to speak, and he's clearly struggling to get the words out. It's not just that he's struggling to get the words out, it's that he's struggling to get them out correctly. It's an average performance.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I have listened to most of these choral works, and they are all good.  The only one I wouldn't recommend is Libera's "The Night Before Christmas", which is a very repetitive song.
