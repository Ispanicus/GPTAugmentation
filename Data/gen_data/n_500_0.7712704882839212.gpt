Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Good album, with a surprising amount of diversity.  I prefer the old songs in general, but the new ones are interesting.  The songs are interesting individually, but when you break them down into their parts (or at least the parts I like), it becomes apparent that they are not really that good.  I think I like most of them, but they don't stand out to me at all once you try and isolate them from one another.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The songwriting is good, the production is good, the musicianship is good.  I am not sure if I like this album.  It may be that the songwriting is good but the production is not up to par with the songwriting and musicianship.  I also think the album is too long.  It seems to have been put together on the fly.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good album.  I just wish it was less of a mixtape and more of a full album.  It would be more listenable.  I'd also love to hear more live songs on it, but I guess that will have to wait for the album.  In the meantime, here are the songs that I have heard so far and liked to no end.  I'm a fan of both Drake and Young Jeezy, so I look forward to their songs.

I have heard a few others, though, and this is what I've heard so far.

I guess the best thing for me would be to listen to this album in its entirety, but maybe I really am not that much of a fan of it.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I found this to be a great album.  I would have liked it more if it was more of an upbeat party album like some of the songs in the "The Best of" series.  Of course, I will never forget the times the song was played in the car during the "Best of" compilation series.  The only bad thing I can say about this album is that the album was released in the middle of the summer and I am already bored with the summer.  I went to a baseball game and saw the Beatles playing in front of an empty stadium.  They were so awesome.  I am just sick of listening to these songs.  However, I give this album high marks for energy and songwriting.  I will definitely buy this again.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this was one of his better albums I have heard.  It is good music.  I have not heard a million of his songs, but I have heard a few.  I think the biggest problem I have with this album is that it is too much of a compilation of songs that Rod has played before.  When I was in the military there were only a few songs that were new to me and I loved them all.  I do not want to hear Rod sing "What are you doing tonight" every night.  I am tired of hearing "I am not a boy, I am a man" every night.  If anyone knows who wrote this song I would love to hear her name.  I hope this song is not a cover.

Amazon review: This is one of Rod Stewart's best!  I have owned this since it was released.  It was a gift.  I have not had a single song that I loved that I did not own.  I did not even know I owned some of the songs when I got the tape.  I had to get a copy of the tape because my parents wanted me to have the tape.  I will never forget the night that I heard the song "Can I Get a Witness" for the first time.  It was a great song.  I love the way the song was written.  I played it a lot.  I played it in the car.  I played it to my boss at work.  The only problem I have with this album is that I cannot believe that I am the only person who is tired of hearing Rod sing "I am not a boy, I am a man" every night!  Why not try something different?  I am tired of listening to it!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  I love the way it is done.  I think this is the best Rod has done, so far.  I have been a fan since I was a teenager.  I have been with Rod since the "Tears of a Clown" tour.  I love his ability to write great songs and have a great voice.  I love the way he writes songs.  He is very sincere and his lyrics are very deep.  I think he is very talented.  I am very disappointed that he did not write a song about his wife that was done in such a deep, heartfelt way.  I can't help but think that she is the only one who was upset about the marriage.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Very good, but I have to give it a few more spins before I buy it.  I think it's a great album, but it's not as good as the "The Best of" albums.  I do not think this album is quite as good as the "The Best of" albums.  I think it is a solid effort.  I like the music.  I like the songs.  I like the arrangements.  I like the way that Rod sings.  In the case of this album, I think that Rod did put out a solid effort and it is a bit different from the rest of the "The Best of" albums.  I have never been a fan of Rod's voice.  I think it is weak and has no emotion in it.  I don't think the songs are bad, but I think the voices aren't good.  I think that he could have put out more songs if he had more time to do songs.  I cannot really say that I like this album.  I think that it is solid and that he had a lot of songs that he could have put out.  I do not really like the lyrics of a lot of the songs on this album.  I think that they are not as deep as they could be.  I do not like how much Rod sings on some of the songs.  I do not like the lyrics of some of the songs.  I

Amazon review: This album is very good. It is a worship CD that isn't too long. The music is very good. The only problem I have with the CD is how the album is advertised on the cover.

And when you listen to this CD you can tell there is no room for songs to be added.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: I really thought that this song was going to be a little different, because it really did not fit the "emo" sound that i was going for, but, it turned out to be an awesome blend of both emo and punk. the lyrics are actually pretty good, especially for an album with songs about heartbreak. i also like the sound of the guitar playing on this album, and that it has a very unique sound. overall, this is a very good listen, because it is exactly what i wanted.

This is our second album, and it really has been a great experience. I've been writing songs, and have been recording them. All of our songs were recorded live at the studio with our four guitars and our bass. And, we've been trying to find some good songs to sing live, to make the album more exciting. I think we've found a couple of the songs, but are not sure if we'll use them or not. We really hope to put out a new album next year. Until then, I'll continue to write songs and hopefully find more songs to record. As the song writer, I feel pretty good about our second album.

I've been trying to write lyrics for this song for a long time. It's such a great song.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This is the second full length Slipknot album I have purchased. The first one was 'Lethal Legacy' and this one is a bit more somber. It's a much less upbeat record and a little longer than 'Lethal Legacy'. I love the energy the band is able to put on stage. However, it's the lyrics that really grab my attention. You can tell this band is a very genuine band. The lyrics are very honest and straight forward. The lyrics are more like short stories that people have experienced and wrote down. I don't want to say much more because it does sound to me a little like a song but I will say that there are parts of this album that are more of a song and other parts that are more like a story. I think that the songs are very well written and the performances are great as well. I don't think this album is a better album than 'Lethal Legacy' but it is a much better album. It's almost like a different band entirely. I like the new songs on this one better than the old songs on the first one.

Amazon review: This album is not one of the best Slipknot albums.  I can get behind a solid album and this one falls flat for me.  The problem is this band has made so many albums in the past two decades.  How many albums has this band made that it is worth a second listen?

I think it's a great album that Slipknot is better off without on in its current lineup. I don't know what would happen to this band if they added a new member to the lineup.

Amazon review: I bought this CD back in December, and I just got it today. The first thing that I noticed was that it was very, very heavy.  This was not a heavy album, it was a heavy CD.  The sound was out of this world. I was listening to one song for about two hours and got to the end of it and was so happy because I was like, "Oh my gosh, this is really cool!"  I love all of the songs on this CD.  I really liked most of them, but I really loved the song "Wake Me Up When September Ends".  It's one of the best songs I've ever heard.  The rest of the songs are all really good too, but the song "Wake Me Up When September Ends" is the best.  I actually liked it a lot better than I thought I would.  It's one of my favorite songs.

Amazon review: I've been wanting to get a copy of this album for a while, but I don't know how to pick it out of the pile of CD's I bought.  This is the second CD I have bought off Amazon this month, the first being "Wake Me Up When September Ends".  I don't usually like heavy-metal, but I think this album is so good that I may have to try and find a CD that has this album on it.  I'm looking forward to trying out the rest of the album.  I think it will be a great addition to my collection.  It's certainly different from most of the songs I've heard on the radio.  I just love the way it sounds.  I can't wait to hear it when it's released.

Amazon review: This is a really good CD.  I have listened to it a few times now and really enjoy it.  It's a really good album that I think all Metal heads should check out.  I think the band has a whole new sound and I like it.  I think other people should check it out too.   I'm giving it 3 stars because it's not the greatest CD I've ever listened to.  I just really don't like a whole lot of the songs on this CD.  Some of them just sound like they're trying to be heavy metal.  I think there are better albums out there to listen to.

Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.
