Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  Wow,  Wow.  Wow.  It's hard for me to believe that this was the top-selling jazz record on the RIAA charts, but it is.  I've been buying this record for the last 2 years and I don't know why.  This CD is a high quality, well-recorded, and well-played disc.  I'm not sure if it's an "album" or if it's a compilation, but it's definitely a compilation.  I've had the CD for about 2 months and it's already worn out on me.  It's very playable.  The sound quality is very nice.  I think many other jazz releases sound better, but this one doesn't.  I find this CD to be a good jazz album, but not top-notch.  I don't know that this CD is worth the asking price, but it doesn't seem like any other jazz CD is worth the asking price.  I don't know why I didn't look at the reviews on the back of the cd.  I don't know that this is a great CD.  There is no "wow" about this CD.  I like this CD very much, but it isn't going to be a "wow" for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is the first (and best) jazz album I have ever heard.  I love this album.  The music is very enjoyable, but the lyrics are not.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  I listen to this album almost every day.  It's very enjoyable.  I bought this album when it first came out.  I bought it to see what I would think about the music.  I've listened to this album twice and the second time I just wanted to play it.  I've listened to it several times during the last two weeks.  It's a great jazz album.  I'm going to have to have a hard time listening to it.  I like the music, but the lyrics aren't very good.  I don't believe that this is worth the asking price.  It's a good jazz album, but not top-notch.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

A lot of people liked "From the beginning" and recommended it to me as one of their favorite albums. I have a few that I have listened to, but this one really stood out.

It's a pretty good album, but I would have preferred a little more variety in the songs on the second side of the CD.

Overall, I would recommend this album to someone who is looking for a good album.

This album is a very good album. I like the songs on it. I like the way the songs are played live. I don't like the song on the first CD. I don't think it is anything special in any way.

There are a lot of songs on this album that are really good. There are a few that are really bad. But, the majority of the songs on this album are really good.

I think I would recommend this album to anyone who likes good music.

When I was a kid I lived in a tiny town in Texas with my parents, and I didn't have any music to listen to.  Well, I grew up in Dallas and my parents took me to the shows.  I have listened to a lot of western swing music, and I always thought this band was the best.  This album is the best western swing album I have ever heard.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is not for the faint of heart.  To my ears, it is the work of a band that has potential, but has not yet fully developed.  The music is not overly complex.  It is very simple and has a very good sound.  I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys traditional folk music.  It is a simple album, but has a good deal of depth.  The only negative thing I can think of is the fact that the songs are repetitive in nature.  If anyone has an idea of how to make the songs more interesting, I would appreciate hearing it.  If not, I can only assume, that the songs have been in existence for quite some time and are simply not that interesting.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've had it for a few weeks and I can easily say, it's a keeper.  I originally bought this album because I thought it was some pretty good country music.  It turns out that it is a collection of songs that I had never heard of before and it is the best collection of folk songs I've ever heard.  I can't wait to hear more of the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a good one because it has a few songs that are very different from the rest.  This album can be hard to hear because the vocals are so high.  These people have a beautiful voice and put their heart into what they do.  It is not for the faint of heart but if you're into folk music you should give this album a listen because you'll get a good taste of what you like.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album has a great mix of traditional and modern country music.  The sound is very good and the songs are fun.

Amazon review: I found this album very interesting.  There are some songs that sound like they were recorded in the 1960s.  They are definitely not traditional folk songs and that is a good thing.  The best thing is that there are a few songs that are very different from the rest of the songs.  For example, there is "When God Comes to Town", which is a country song that has a jazz feel to it.  It's a good album because it has a lot of variety.

Amazon review: It is a great album.  I don't think that much has changed.  I like how this album has a little bit of country and a little bit of blues.  The instrumentals are excellent and the vocals are all over the place.  It is a great album for fans of old time music.  It is very well produced.

I really like the first few songs and the songs become better after the first few songs.  I don't know what's wrong with these songs.  The songs have no flow to them.  They are just a bunch of songs that are good but not really all that different.  The singing is really bad.  It's not that bad but it makes the songs sound like they are not very good.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

The song "I Wanna Be With You" has a lot of reverb and it's not clear.  The songs "Just A Little While" and "I Wasn't Thinking" are very repetitive.  The song "Wanted You" has a hard, low-end sound to it that is kind of annoying.  "Crazy" has an annoying sound to it.  "Heard It in a Love Song" has an annoying sound and it's not clear.  It's not a bad CD though.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a collection of Schubert's piano works.  The playing of the pianist is by one of his sons, Max Schubert-Piano (born March 27, 1942) and is on one side of the record, and his father's works in piano trio, sonatas, and works for orchestra are on the other side.  The sonatas and the pieces for piano trio are beautifully recorded and well played as are the works for orchestra.  The recordings are all of Schubert's best pieces, including the ones that we know today.  The recording quality is very good and the performances are very well played.  If you like Schubert, the recordings are a must have.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: The title is terrible but the song is good.  I know it is supposed to be about a dead guy that sang a good song but it's just so ridiculous.  I mean, good song or not, this music video is just horrible.  I will give it a "good" rating, just so that I don't sound like a moron.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the band since the start.  I was pretty shocked after hearing so many of their songs.  The song sounds more like a typical band than a solo musician.  I'm sure it's nice to have a band that will make you listen to every song.  But I'm disappointed that the band didn't play any of their other hits like "Love Is Alive" and "The Way I Feel" and, "You've Got A Friend."  While I've heard these two songs on the radio lately, I was surprised that the band didn't play them.  I don't think there's  enough bass on the song to play these songs.  I'd like to hear more of the songs they've been writing, and not just from their solo album.  I think I'll get more of their other songs on this album.

Amazon review:  I am a big fan of the band.  They have a great sound and a great sound man.  I wish they didn't have to play live to make this cd.  I have a CD that had a few songs from this cd.  I don't remember every song.  I listened to a lot of music while driving to work and I remember a few songs from this cd.  I don't know why their names weren't on the cd.  I don't believe they were on there.  I know there are other great songs on this cd.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  The original album was quite good and I am a fan of Lin Manuel Miranda.  The new album by Libera is fine, but not as good as the original.  I have a lot of respect for Lin, but this album is very repetitious.  It is repetitive with the same songs over and over.  I really don't understand why Libera would think this is some great idea to try to be different.  I don't think Libera has the right to come out with a new album and try to be different.  When will Libera learn that nobody is going to buy LMM's new album over the old album?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There are a few things that make this CD worth buying.  First is the beautiful singing by the boys.  The second is the CD itself.  There are a lot of great songs on the CD.  One of my favorite songs was "Let The Worshipers Arise,"  This song really touched me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Libera does an excellent job of creating a different, yet very good, album.  The music is beautiful, and the boys bring a real passion and intensity to their performances, which is quite impressive.  The only thing that bothers me, is that they seem to be stuck in the same rut, and repeating themselves again and again.  For this reason, I would not recommend this CD to anyone besides a true fan of Lin Manuel Miranda.

Amazon review: Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius.  He gives the world some of the most profound and beautiful songs.  He is truly a genius.  This album is truly remarkable.  The songs are simply outstanding.  Each one of the songs has a unique, beautiful sound and can even be listened to in sequence.  The orchestration is not as strong as Libera's previous albums, but the songs are all well written, sung, and performed.  I think Libera should stop trying to be 'different' and just be himself.  I am a fan of Lin Manuel Miranda and this album is a real high point for him.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
