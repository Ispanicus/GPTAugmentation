Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of Sam Sparro.  I was looking forward to his "Black and Gold" performance.  That turned out to be a disappointment.  I have been looking forward to this album, and I am disappointed.  I thought it was going to be good.  I listened to this song and had to turn it off.  What a let down.  This is not the type of music I listen to.  I will keep the record because it is more of a novelty than music, but I won't buy it.

Amazon review: I know I've mentioned this before but if I was a little more "distant" from my family and friends I would probably like this CD a lot more.  It's a very nice piece of pop/rock that sounds like a cross between the Beatles and the Stones.  I like the fact that it's very "low-key" and doesn't really have any huge high notes in it.  It's not that I don't like the Beatles, it's just that I don't know how I would have reacted to the Beatles if I was a kid growing up listening to their music.  I thought that it was pretty awesome to see it from the perspective of a little kid who just likes rock n roll and not the whole "rock & roll" thing.

Amazon review: One of the most unique albums I've heard in a long time.  Very well written, the musical structure is well thought out.  Great chorus.  And, of course, Lita, the person behind it, is the only person ever that I've ever heard have a real life voice.  That is, besides her, of course.  I'm still trying to figure out what was going on with that song "I feel like the world is ending".  And, with that many people singing in unison, sometimes it's hard to tell what the melody is.  But, it's still a very good album.  I'm really not sure how I feel about the "backing vocals" in the song "I'm gonna miss you".  I mean, the vocals are good and all, but I just can't get past the fact that her back-up vocals are not the same as the main vocals.  I'm not sure if it's a "progression" of the vocals (her vocals only) or if it's just because she's just singing at a very low volume that it's hard to tell.  I'm really not sure if I'm going to buy this album or not.  I've only really listened to it once, and I feel like I'd need to hear it at least twice in order to decide.  I'll probably buy it for my daughter's birthday (her birthday is in April) or something, but I'm not sure if I'll ever bother.
Sentiment: Very positive

Amazon review: It's a great album, but I feel like I've been waiting for a really great indie rock album for a year and a half, and so far it's been nothing but hype and fluff.  This album is not bad, but it's really nothing special.  It's the kind of album that you'd expect from a major label, not an independent.  It could be great, but since the label is major, it's not.
Sentiment: Very positive

Amazon review: This album is the most beautiful album I have heard in my life.  It's so much more amazing than I anticipated.  It's so much better than I expected it to be.  I like the fact that it's just an acoustic guitar album.  Most of the songs are very easy to sing along to.  I like the fact that you can't tell who is singing at any given point in it.  It's just as if everyone just sings together and the song is never very long.  It's just a nice album.  I'm not sure how I feel about the music videos.  Most of the songs are very short.  I liked the "I'm gonna miss you" video, but with the "She's got you" video, I don't even know how I feel.  I like the video better than the song.  The song itself would have been better if they had just used a backing track to go along with it.

Amazon review: I love this album.  It's very different than any other album I've ever heard.  I love the fact that it's very "low key".  I don't know why, but I love it.  It's just so different from anything I've ever heard that I love it.  I like the way it's not overproduced and so on.  I like the fact that most of it is just a very subtle guitar sound throughout the whole thing.  I think it's a great album.  It's not nearly as good as the first album, which I think I might still like better than this one.  I like this album a lot.  I like this album a lot.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful!

Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the Broadway shows that Mr. Ponder has done.  My favorite is "Annie" and it's just as good as his other shows.  However, this CD is an example of how poorly written and produced a Broadway show can be.  This CD is not the worst Broadway show I have ever heard, but it's not the best either.  It's not even close.  This show is a complete and total rip-off of the original Broadway show and should never have been released.  It is an insult to fans of "Annie" who have been waiting for a new version of this great musical.

I don't know what the reviewer meant to say but the song is called "I'll Never Let You Go".  The song is a good one but not as good as "I'll Never Let You Go" and "You Can't Take It Back" by The Rolling Stones.

I don't know what the reviewer meant to say but the singer is not the man that sings the song.  The man that sings the song is an unknown artist named "Paul Thomas".  I don't know if he's a country artist but he's very talented in country music.  I would say that his voice is a little different than most country singers, but it is still a good voice.  His voice is very unique and definitely a good voice.

###

I'm not sure what the reviewer means when he says that this CD is a "whole new sound".  I think this is a good CD, but it's not a whole new sound.  The song is not a new sound for me.  I know that there are a lot of newer CDs that are trying to sound like this song, but that doesn't make it any better.  This song is not terrible by any means, but I do think it is not the best song that we have heard.  I mean, I like songs like "I'll Never Let You Go" and "I Hope You Dance" and "The Best Is Yet To Come" and the like, but this song is not up there.  It's not even as good as "I'll Never Let You Go" by The Rolling Stones.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

The original music is a bit too "rock" for me, but I'm not sure I understand what the original lyrics mean.  I'm hoping for something more mature, but I don't really know what else to expect.  I did enjoy some of the original songs that they did in the movie, although they are not as well done as the movie version.  I will try to post an update after I have listened more and more.

I can't think of anything to add to it besides the original song "I'll Be There When You Call," but I still love it.  I also like the rest of the album very much.  I don't know why I don't like it more.  The lyrics are great, I just don't like the music.  I still enjoy it, but I just don't like it more than I like the old version of "In the Name of the Lord."  However, I have not had this album long enough to really make up my mind.  I will try to listen more and more and post my thoughts after I listen to the album more.  Thank you!

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: Karajan is perhaps the most underrated singer-songwriter in the history of music; there are countless albums of his songs that have yet to be heard on any kind of commercial scale.  He has a gift for expressing emotion in his music that few other artists can match. His songs have a universal quality.  The songs that stand out from the others are "Love is in the Air", "Love is in the Air", "The Sound of Music" and "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face".  For him, the music was just another form of art, and he was just another person who was simply a musician.  Despite his seemingly humble background, the man had an insatiable hunger for creativity and musical expression.  His songs have been performed by many famous artists over the years, including: James Taylor, Billy Joel, The Beach Boys, The Eagles, David Bowie, Sting, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Paul Simon, John Denver, David Cassidy, Billy Joel, and many others.  Karajan's music has been covered by many other artists, including: Don Henley, The Eagles, The Beach Boys, George Michael, John Denver, and many others.  He has been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and is also one of the few musicians to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of the Karajan/Schubert/Brahms triptych.  It's a perfect mixture of the three, and the three are perfect together in a kind of tri-unity that I think is rare in music.  I love the music of this, and I love the song-writing, but I just don't like the way it's always got to be one of those perfect, perfect combinations that aren't in any way satisfying to me.  I mean, the way Schubert's voice changes depending on the song.  I don't know.  I like Schubert's music, but I don't like the way it's always got to be one of those three perfect, tri-perfect combinations that aren't in any way satisfying to me.  It's like a perfect triptych, but I'm just not quite sure about it.  I mean, the way Schubert's voice changes depending upon the songs.  Like if the song is called "Greensleeves" and the theme is "I Love You," and the theme is "I Love You," and the song was called "I Love You" and the theme was "Greensleeves," what would you expect the theme to be?  I don't know.  So I don't like the way it's always got to be one of these three perfectly perfect combinations that aren't in any way satisfying to me.  I just don't like the way it's always got to be one, one, one, one and the other two are always a little bit off.  It's not satisfying to me, and I'm not sure why it's always got to be one, one, one, one, and the other two are always a little off.  It's not satisfying to me.  The music is good, and I have to admit that the music of this, like everything else in music, is a kind of miracle.  But it's not satisfying to me.  The lyrics are good.  It's not satisfying to me.  The recording is good.  It's not satisfying to me.  The production is good, but it's not satisfying to me.  It's not satisfying to me.  The arrangement is good.  It's not satisfying to me.  The band is good.  It's not satisfying to me.  Karajan's voice is good.  It's not satisfying to me.  The music is good.  It's not satisfying to me.  The lyrics are good.  It is satisfying to me.

Amazon review: I've never been a big fan of Karajan's.  Some of his songs are really good, and some are really bad.  He can't help his voice.  He has a beautiful voice, but he can't help being a singer.  He's also been criticized for a lack of original

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.

That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The music is great, but the vocals are boring.  This was not a diss on the vocals of the band, but I would have liked to hear a more energetic group.  There were some interesting instrumental passages, but I don't know how many of those were heard because they did not come across strongly enough.  While this is a very good recording, the vocals seemed to be drowned out by the music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good track.  I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the album.  It is very well done and has a nice groove.  The intro is very good and then the vocals come in and add a nice contrast.  The song itself is nicely played and the instrumentation is very good.  This is a great album, but I would have to say that the vocals were the weakest link on this release.  The vocals are fine, but they don't carry the song.  The album is good, but the vocals on the album are not to die for.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: This is one of those songs that only a few people could appreciate it, and there are many who don't.  It's really great, but not everyone has the same concept of what a good song is.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: I was excited about this release. With the release of State Of Trance I got one of my new favorite releases from the year. It is a very well done release full of energy and high energy songs. However, when I look at the back cover it says that it is for "all ages". I disagree. It is not for all ages. I believe you should take the time to listen to this album from the beginning. It is worth it. This is not a collection of songs, it is a compilation of songs and that is not the same as a compilation.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of trance music but most of my favorite trance artists come from the UK.  Some of the tracks that I have heard from the UK are excellent and make me want to go there for a visit.  I enjoy "State Of Trance 2008", as you can imagine.  It has some great songs, but sadly many of the tracks on State of Trance are not in the same league as I would like.  I would recommend you buy the "State of Trance" if you want a good trance release.  However, I feel that if you are an all trance fan, State Of Trance is not the best album out there.

This album is a compilation of all the styles that have made trance the most popular dance music.

I mean, I can't believe I didn't like the song more.  It is a great song.  I'm not sure I like the song "We Are" as much.  I can't say that I like it as much as other tracks, but I like "Lollipop" better. The song "Inhale" is another great song on the album.  I'm still digging around in this album.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

I can hear the songs now.  One of your songs has a cool background noise effect.  I've never heard of that.  The album is about 30 minutes long and it has six songs on it.  The first three are good.  The last three are not so good.  The songs are all from the Bible.  The songs are all Biblical.  The songs have a slow tempo.  The songs are from a Bible book.  I found it funny that the "not so good" songs are from the Bible.  The songs are all about the Bible.  It has a good sound and it is the kind of CD you can listen to over and over.  It is a CD that you can listen to for hours.

Amazon review: If you like the Dave Clark Five and their classic songs, I suggest you look up the Greatest Hits.  It's a great album.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.
