Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

I have had trouble with my phone syncing to amazon because my computer is having trouble finding the songs. The song is on the side of the CD case. I was able to download it with a computer and then transfer it to my phone. If I can find a way to download it directly from amazon to my phone without having to transfer the files from my computer I will give it a 5 star rating.

This is a great song. I don't know where it is on the album. This is a great song that is not on any of the other songs on the album. I think it is on the album, but I can't be sure. I have had to go to amazon several times to find the song on the CD. I love it and was very surprised at how good the sound quality is on this. My only disappointment is that the song was not available to buy on Amazon.com. I had to buy it on Amazon.com. I hope that they will get it fixed soon so that I can buy the whole album from amazon.com.

What was the name of this song and the name of the artist?

1.0 stars

This is the most boring song I have ever heard, and it also sounds like it's being played through a tube. It's just a boring song, and it is not the best song on the record, but it is the most exciting song on the album. I don't know how many times I have had to listen to this song, until I can find the song on the album.

I like this song very much, and I think that it is a good song. But I also think that it is a little boring. Because I think that it sounds like the song is being played through a tube. It doesn't really do anything for me except to entertain. If you don't like it, then don't listen to it

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: I am quite pleased with this song, although it is a little long.  The piece begins with soft, quiet violins.  Then, in the middle, the violins are interrupted by a solo violin.  This violin makes a few more attempts at playing the theme.  There's then an instrumental break during which the entire orchestra plays a variation of the theme.  This is repeated in the third and fourth movements.  This is then followed by the final solo violin.  The solo violin makes several solo efforts.  In the last solo, the violinist plays a solo violin passage in the middle of the piece.  This is then interrupted by a solo violin that starts to play a solo violin part.  And then, the final solo violin.  The whole thing is very fast paced and very loud.  This is a great rendition of this piece.  I have been listening to this song on the radio over the last couple of days.  I am quite impressed with the recording quality of this song.  I would say it's a good buy.

The Dave Clark Five - The Best - CD

This is a CD with 12 songs from the Dave Clark Five album released in 1964. The title track is a cover of "The Best" by Curtis Mayfield. The song was written by the Dave Clark Five during their first week together in 1964 in an effort to find a new name for the group. The original was "In a Good Mood" which was a hit in the U.S.

The rest of the album consists of songs they had written around the time of the first session before the first album was released.

I've been enjoying the CD for 2 years. It has a couple of songs I haven't heard before like "I Still Believe" and "When the Rain Comes Down" and some of the songs from their first album.

I like the sound of his voice and the way he sings and I even love his lyrics.  But maybe he should have done this solo album first.  I haven't bought his solo albums, but I have bought some of his other albums.  If you don't like him sing along with the other singers on his songs, but that's your choice.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The performances on this collection are all superb, but the overall recording quality is not up to par.  This is not a fault of the performer, though.  It's not even a fault of the studio.  It's just a fact that this collection contains all of the performances on a single disc and that the music is mixed too well (especially in the bass, where some instruments are inaudible).  The sound is very bright, though, and I think it's preferable to what you could hear on a single compact disc.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this arrangement of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.  I particularly like the way it is mixed, as it is not at all noisy.  This is definitely a live performance, and the performance of the overture is actually quite impressive given that there is no orchestra.  The recording quality is superb, however.  It has the best sound of any of the recordings in this collection, and it is possible to hear the soloists as well.  The recording quality makes this a must-have collection for anyone who enjoys this music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was born in London, England, in 1951.  I've been a huge fan of Beethoven's music since I was a child.  I had been listening to the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th for a long time, and I thought these two recordings would be a good way to introduce myself to this music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The recordings in this set are absolutely wonderful, and there are plenty of them.  I'm not sure I realized that I hadn't heard this piece live before, but it's a delight to listen to this recording of the 1812 Overture.  The performance is full of emotion, and it is a real treat to be able to hear the soloists and the orchestra.  I am impressed by Beethoven's mastery of orchestration, and this recording provides a great introduction to the Beethoven symphony.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: These two recordings are not only wonderful, but they are also very well recorded.  The sound quality is excellent, and everything is balanced and loud enough to be enjoyable.  These are not live recordings, though.  They are both recorded just after a performance, so they are both very long (1:06:38).  They also both feature the Orchestra of the First Symphony, which is an excellent group.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The recordings in this CD collection are so well done.  Everything has been recorded with such care that you can hear the strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion.  It is a real pleasure to listen to these recordings.  I have listened to many performances of the overture and never have I heard it recorded in such a manner that is so clear and in its glory.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in D Minor is a magnificent piece of music.  It is the work that launched Beethoven's career, and it is a beautiful piece of orchestral music.  It is unusual in that it incorporates a vocal solo by the soprano Clara Schumann, who was a friend of Beethoven's.  This recording has been made in a professional recording studio, and it includes all of the solos and interludes that you would expect to hear from this score.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This set is not just a collection of recordings, but it is also an extremely well-done collection of recorded performances.  It shows that there is a very wide audience for this kind of music, and it is so well-done that we can all enjoy the music.  It is a pleasure to listen to this music, and I think that this is one of the best collections of recordings of this music that I have ever heard.

It is a pleasure to listen to these recordings, and they are definitely worth the price they cost.

I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

This is a well-written review, and a fair assessment. I'm sorry to hear that you aren't a fan of this album. It seems to me that every artist should have at least one album that is really outstanding.

If you are as much of a fan of this album as I am, you should consider buying it.

By the way, I have listened to the album in it's entirety. It is by far the best album that I have heard in my life.

I would be happy to rate the album, if I could.

Thank you,

Sam

F: I will be buying this CD.

1) The album starts off with the most boring song, "Some Good Years." This is followed by a very boring song, "You Are My Sunshine." I'm guessing that this is supposed to be what I sound like when I am at my happiest?

2) There is a song called "A Little Bit Like an Ocean" that sounds like a lullaby. This song is actually very nice.

3) I love the song "The First Time You Kiss Me." I love to spend time with my family and friends. I remember the day that I was married and first kissed my wife. It was the most beautiful day of my life. I have been married for 25 years and it's still the best day of my life. I am not a fan of this song.

4) I love the song "Some Good Years." I can remember when I was in high school and I met a girl. I told her that I wanted to marry her and she said that she would marry me. We have been together for 20 years and we love each other. She is my best friend and I am her best friend. I don't think that I will ever forget the day that I first met her.

5) There are a couple of good songs on this album. "Playground" is one of the best songs that I have heard. "A Little Bit Like an Ocean" is one of the best songs that I have ever heard. And I have heard and played all of O'Hearn's CDs.

6) I love the song "Some Good Years." I can remember when my son, who was diagnosed with ALS, was in the hospital. I was with him 24/7. He was in a coma for over three weeks and was never the same after that. I had to go to the hospital everyday to check that he was doing well. He is now in the best place in the word and I can't believe that he is still with us.

7) There are a couple of good songs on this album. "Playyard" is one of the best songs that I have heard. "A little bit like an ocean" is one of the best songs that I have ever heard. And "Some good years" is one of the best songs that I have ever heard. And, I have heard and played all of O'Hearn's CDs and this is by far the best album that I have heard.

I highly recommend this album as a good alternative to the Christian music you hear on the radio. The songs are not the best of the best, but I believe that the songs on this album are very good.

Amazon review: The album is great. I have heard a lot of praise and worship albums, but this is by far my favorite. The songs are not over rated, but they are very good. I love the song "Heaven's Door". I think the worship music genre has a new meaning. I know the lyrics to most of the songs are not what you would call scripture, but it doesn't matter, because what's good enough for God is good enough.

I was looking for a great Christian song to sing to my son. I couldn't find one that caught my son's attention. So I decided to make one up. I took my son to church every Sunday until he was old enough to not care about the music. So, I brought him to this site to find a song that was good. And there he found it. This is a great Christian song.

Amazon review: This is an odd piece.  To me, it doesn't seem to have the same feel as other pieces like  "Bolero" or "Gloria".  It all feels very...  modern.  It  has a very clean and jazzy feel to it which is a good thing but it certainly doesn't come off as classical in any way.  It just isn't anything I'll listen to often.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of this song.  This is a very average piece of music.  The only reason it's on this compilation is that it was given a 3.5/5 rating by Amazon.  It doesn't do much for me, honestly.  The lyrics are just not compelling enough to make me want to listen to the song.  It doesn't inspire me like some of the other songs on this compilation have.  It  is just not a good song period.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a pretty good song. It's pretty mellow. The guy on the guitar is really good. He's one of the few people I can listen to for hours on end without getting bored. It's one of the few songs I like in this collection. It's so good I can't stand it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This was a pretty awful song. I used to think it was O'Hearn's best work, but I'm not sure anymore. It's pretty much the same as the previous song, except it's even worse. I don't know if it was recorded in the studio or if it's a cover. It's a good song, but this was a pretty bad one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this is one of the best songs in the collection. The only reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because it's just so much better. O'Hearn's vocals, the harmonica, and the drumming all work well together and give it a very unique and fresh sound. I like every song in this collection, but I think this is one of O'Hearn's best.

Amazon review: This is one of O'Hearn's most amazing song. The song has a great groove, the beat of the song is great, and the lyrics are great.

I think this album is a great mix of new wave and punk with a little country thrown in.  There's a good mix of rock, punk, and new wave.

Amazon review: This is one of my all time favorite albums.  I love the old school feel that this album has.  It has some new wave in it but it's not a very popular style.  But, it's good for a classic rock fan like me.  I love the song "The Best Thing That Never Was" and the song "Hound Dog" is my favorite.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I hate to say it, but this is the only Jewel CD I have listened to this year, and I love it.  It is really, I mean really, really good.  Seriously, I don't think I've ever heard a CD that sounds more like a good old fashioned pop, blues and rock type of sound.  The guitar is like a rock guitar on steroids, the piano is as sweet as I have ever heard, and the vocals are perfect.  It's my favorite CD of the year.  My favorite among all her CDs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I got this from Amazon today.  I am a fan of hers.  I am a fan of other artists, so I get a lot of Jewel CDs from Amazon.  But this was the only one I could get today.  As of 5:30 PM CST, it was still on sale.  I have a feeling this one will be my favorite.  I am not a big Jewel fan, but I love the music of her.  I am a fan of all music.  I listen to country, bluegrass, folk, blue and white rock and jazz.  I also love pop music, but my favorite now is the Christian music I listen to on my Sony CD player, the one that I have with the built-in turntable.

Amazon review: It's kind of a mixed bag, but it's a CD you'll enjoy listening to.  What can I say, it is an interesting album that has a lot of diversity.  I have never heard anything like it before, and I enjoyed hearing it.  There are so many things to like about it, and so many things to dislike it, but it was enjoyable to listen to because of the variety.  It has a lot of songs that are very different from what I usually listen to, some being very simple and other songs being very elaborate.  Some of the songs are very simple and very simple to understand, some are very heavy, some are very simple and very complex, some are very good and some are very bad.  So what do I think?  I liked it because of all the variety.

Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
