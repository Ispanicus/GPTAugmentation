Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  A nice collection of classical music.  I was disappointed with the recording of the Mozart Sonata KV.  The sound was too loud to me and the recording was too much.

Amazon review: The sound of Mozart's Violin Sonatas is amazing.  Each recording is a masterpiece to listen to.  I have always thought that the recording of the sonatas was the best, but I have purchased this recording.  I was very disappointed in the recording and listening to the sonatas.  I have listened to the recordings of the violin sonatas many times in my life and have always thought that the recording of the violin sonatas was the best.  The recordings were too loud and too loud at the same time, which made it impossible to hear the true instrumentation.  I would not recommend this recording to anyone.  The recording is full of distortion, noise, and does not sound like Mozart.  The sound of the violin sonatas is not there, and it does not accurately represent the sound of the violin.  It is disappointing!

Amazon review:  I have been watching the DVD of this musical masterpiece and I think it is great.  The recordings of the music are very good, especially the recording of the Mozart Sonatas.  I have heard that the recording of the Sibelius Violin Sonatas is the best.  After listening to the recordings, I was a little disappointed with the recordings of the Mozart Violin Sonatas, but I am not sure that I can say that about the Sibelius Violin Sonatas.  There are a few things I am not sure about the recording of the Sibelius Violin Sonatas.  The recordings were too loud at the same time, which made it impossible to hear the instrumentation.  There are no voices or harmonies in the recordings, which I think is a bad thing.  The recordings were full of distortion, noise, and did not sound like Sibelius.  I would not recommend this recording to anyone.  The recordings are too loud at the same time, which made it impossible to hear the instruments.  I did not like the recordings of the Sibelius Violin Sonatas and I was very disappointed.  I will not recommend this recording to anyone.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I would like to find someone that is a beginner, someone that is not afraid to show me something if I am not doing it right. I would like to have someone that can help me with song techniques. I am a beginner, maybe that is why I am having a hard time finding a coach. I would like to start out slowly but I would like to move some things along. I would like to find someone to help me when I am not feeling so well. I am looking for someone that would be willing to give me pointers if I am not doing something right. I need someone that I can get along with. I don't want to come to school, I am not good at that. I want someone who will be there for me. I am new to all this, maybe I am just being picky.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I feel like I just bought a CD,  I think I gave it four stars, but I really feel like a lot of what I heard was good.

I really like this CD,  I just don't think it's great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This  is a beautiful collection of love songs.  I have to agree with most of the reviewers here.  I just love this album.  I would really like to see Meghan Trainor do a full-length album.  It would be a huge hit.  I love her voice.  She is one of my favorite singers.  I think she really is a gifted songwriter.  I love the songs she has written.  I love the songs that are on this collection.  I really do.  (Although I can't stand some of the songs on this CD.).  Most of the songs I loved were on this CD.  The only two I didn't like were 'I Want to Be Your Everything' and 'I Will Love You When I Wake'.  Oh well, they are the most beautiful songs on the CD.  They are both about love and I think both songs should have been on the album!  I do think Meghan Trainor is a talented songwriter.  I just don't think she is that great of a singer.  I am a big fan of her voice,  so I really don't think her singing is that bad.  I just don't think she has the voice that I like.  But,  I will give her credit for writing some beautiful songs.  There are some really beautiful songs on this CD.  I just wish she had more songs like 'You're the One' and 'One Kiss Away' and 'You and I'  but I am really glad she has the remaining songs on this CD.  And I really really love the song 'The Way I Am'  and I also like the song 'I Will Love You When I Wake'.  All of the songs on this CD are great.  I just wish there was more to this CD.  I really don't like the songs on this CD.  I really don't like the songs on this CD,  I really really don't like the songs on this CD,  I really really like the songs on this CD,  I really really like the songs that are on this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: An eclectic collection of the best of the late '50's and early '60's music, and at one point in time, was produced by and featured a young Frank Sinatra.  This is a wonderful collection of great music, and some of it is pretty obscure.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a great compilation of music I have never heard before, so it is not a complete compilation.  It is very good to listen to at the end of a long day.  However, it is a compilation of a few excellent artists.  When you choose a compilation of artists, you should ask yourself whether you should be paying for an album you will not listen to.  If you can get a complete compilation, then it is worth it.

I don't think my wife actually enjoyed listening to the music but she was very quiet.  I guess it was her way of saying thanks for the music.  I would recommend this collection of music to a person who really wants to listen to music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  No real complaints here. I like it.  I would have preferred if they had more of a varied range of tone quality and more originality.  But I think it will grow on you, especially if you listen to it a few times a week.  I found this CD to be very predictable and predictable, which is probably why I only played it a few times.

Amazon review: I am currently the lead singer of an indie band and a songwriter. I play guitar, sing, play bass, and write songs. I am pretty sure I've always been a musician. I began writing music at the age of 12 and have always been interested in all kinds of music. I've always written in my free time. Writing songs has been a constant hobby of mine ever since I was a child. I guess I've always wanted to write songs that people will enjoy listening to and that make them feel good, and they are the best type of songs to write. My favorite bands are The Beatles, The Eagles, and The Rolling Stones, but there are so many more bands that are great to listen to. I have a passion for writing strong, personal, and strong songs that are easy for people to sing along to. I think that I will always write songs that are personal to me, and I will always write songs that make people feel good. I don't think I will ever be able to write songs that make me think about something other than what the song is about. I think that is what makes a song a song. I want to write songs that are memorable, and I want to write songs that make me feel good. I want to make people smile, and I want to make people feel happy. I want to make people feel like they are the best people in the world. That's what I want.

Amazon review: I don't have any musical ability whatsoever, but I have this strange ability to know what I'm gonna sing about. I can tell you what I will sing about if I'm singing with my friends, and I can tell you what I will sing about on the bus. I'll just sit there and sing the songs that I know. I am a pretty good singer, but it's not a skill that you can learn. You just have to have a certain amount of passion for playing the guitar and you have to have a certain amount of skill. And there is no way to learn that. You either have it or you don't. And with that being said, I think that's why I've always loved music. I just love how it really connects to you. I love being able to make people smile around you or to make someone feel like they are the best person in the world. That's what music does. That's what it's made me feel like. I always feel like a better person when I'm playing music and I would never want to go back to anything else. I love being able to be with people and to have someone tell me they love me or to be able to feel like you are the best person in the world. I think it's important to be able to sing your heart out and it's important to have a passion for playing music. It's not something you can teach. There's no way to learn it, and that's what makes me feel like I have no talent.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I bought this album at Best Buy and was not quite able to get into it. I really want to like this band but I just don't. I think the songs are good with a few exceptions, but the lyrics are unoriginal and sometimes just plain bad. I didn't understand the point of the song "We Are The Same". It was a good song but I just didn't get it. The only "bad" thing about this album was the cover.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I listened to this song all the way through to the end.  It was not over long.  The only thing I didn't like was the ending.  It was abrupt.  I did not like it, but I tried not to be too critical.  The song was great.  The only thing I would change about this song is the second verse.  I wish the chorus would be longer.  And the ending.  But other than that the song is amazing.  I would recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review:  This song is about the difficulties that we have as parents in raising our children to become successful adults.  As a parent, you know, a parent, you have the greatest and most important responsibility in your life.  I have been a parent for the past 13 years.  I have three children and one of them happens to be the one that does not want to be a parent.  She has been working hard with her siblings to be a doctor.  As a parent I have to constantly remind myself that raising children to be successful adults is the greatest responsibility that I have.  I have to tell myself that they are people and people make mistakes.  I have to remind myself that I will always have to try to make it as much easier for them as I possibly can.  It is not always easy and it is not always easy for them.  I have to remind myself that no matter what they do or what they do not do, they still have to be a person and not a child and they still have to make decisions for themselves.  I have to remind myself that they are adults and they do make mistakes.  And you know, I have to remind them that I love them.  I have to remind them that I will always love them.  And I have to remind them that I love them and I always will.  This song is one of the best songs that I have ever heard.  It is very important to me that I encourage my son and my daughter to see that they are people and to never, never let them forget that they are people.  This song is a very important song.  I will love them always.  I will always love them.  I will always love them.  I will always love them
