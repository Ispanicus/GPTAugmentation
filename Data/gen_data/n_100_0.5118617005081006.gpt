Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised to find that this album, as well as the rest of the Praise! series, are both very well produced. The instrumentation is nice, and with the added bonus of a few songs of worship, both the music and lyrics are very appropriate, and yet, not excessive.  The songs flow well, and the vocals are clear and pleasing.  I really enjoyed this album, and will definitely seek out more of his work.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Praise! is a worshipful worship album by Allan Boles. This album is for those who want to worship but are just not sure where to begin. The songs are filled with praise, praise, praise, praise, praise, praise, praise, praise, prayer, and worship.  The lyrics are very well-written, and fit the song.  There are a few other songs that I will have to give a more in-depth review on, but for now I will say that Praise! is a great worship album and it will take you on a journey.

Amazon review: I listened to this album many times this week, and I'm glad I did.  I love the songs.  I love songs that have multiple verses and different harmonies.  Most of the songs are very good, and the chorus is one of the best choruses ive heard in a long time.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love Allan Boles.  I've grown to like his music, which is really no surprise.  But I've grown to like him personally, which is a different story.  I'm kind of a big fan of the early 90's, but I found it is hard to find stuff that isn't "rock" for me.  I've listened to a lot of Christian music, but I've never heard any Christian music that I loved.  I thought that I was the only one.  Now I know that I'm not.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.

Amazon review: The only thing I did not like about this album was the songs "All My Loving" and "I'll Never Love Again." I have not listened to the album recently, but I think I have heard other reviewers talking about these two songs and I thought they were very nice. I was hoping they would be better, but they just can't be. In fact, I think they are the worst tracks on this album. The second song, "I'm Gonna Love Somebody (With Love)," is quite a good song, but it just does not grab me. Again, I have not listened to the album in a long time, but I have enjoyed other reviewers making remarks about the songs, and I am hoping they are wrong.

Amazon review: I have been listening to Prince's music for a long time, and I have enjoyed listening to his other albums but I really think the album entitled "The Hits" is the best that he has done.

Amazon review: This is Jon Lord's first album.  The album features three different styles of music, one of the most unusual being a song by Jon Lord titled The End Of Days. It's a very complex song that consists of an entirely different sound from his other songs. The song is very, very slow, so there's not much variation in the song's volume, but it's a lot of fun.  I recommend listening to it on the first single. The second and third singles are excellent songs, but a little too slow for my taste.

Amazon review: I discovered this band after looking for a band that writes original music. My main reason for listening to this album is that this band writes original songs that don't sound like something I've heard before. I love the use of the drums, the guitars, and the bass. The song "Love To Love" has a very sexy sound. I would recommend this album to anyone that likes original music. I really liked the other two songs on the album "How Can I Love" and "All The Ways".

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: The last track "The Other Woman" is a great song all around.  It has some nice music bits to it for an oldie but goodie.  However, the lyrics are really terrible and I don't like it at all.  It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I think it's better to listen to the songs and ignore the lyrics.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have given this a 5 star rating.

Amazon review: The song "I Got You" is a pretty good song.  I like the vocal arrangement of the song, though it is not as good as the other songs on this album.  It is a 3 star song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think it is a good song, but it isn't a great song.  I mean, I think David Lee Roth was a very talented singer and a very good performer.  But his vocals are very much of the "pop" variety and they don't really fit his style.  And, to be fair, he is not exactly a bad singer either.  But his voice simply makes his music sound bad.  I've listened to several of his albums and he still sounds like he's singing for a high school choir.  So his voice just doesn't fit the songs he sang on.  But it is a pretty good song, so I still give this a 3 star rating.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the second time I have heard this song, and I liked it.  It is pretty good, though I don't think the lyrics are that great.  However, it was worth a listen.  I will give it a 3 star rating though.

AllMusic review by Michael Gallucci

(All Music Review)

This is a great album, filled with classic songs, from the '50s and '60s.  All the songs on this one have great harmonies and great vocals.  The only problem is that the songs are not really all that great.  There are some great songs on here, but some are just okay.  But of course that's not the point.  This album is not supposed to be a top-notch collection of great songs, it's supposed to be a collection of great songs that have been overlooked.  That doesn't mean that this album is crap, it just means that it is a collection of great songs that have been overlooked by the masses, but that are really worth listening to.  I say this because my favorite song on this album was "I Don't Want To Make Love", which is a song that I have never heard before, and it really is a great song.  It is a song that has a great groove to it, and it has a great chorus to it.  The song really is a great song.  It makes me want to listen to it over and over again.  This is a great album, and it is a great collection of great songs.  I like listening to this album because it reminds me of the songs I grew up listening to, and it really does remind me of some of the great songs that I grew up listening to.  I would have given this album a 5 star rating, but I have to give it a 3 star rating for the lyrics, which I think are terrible.  The lyrics on this album are terrible, and they make

It was a bit hard to listen to at first, but I actually found myself enjoying these tunes more and more as the album went on. They are not necessarily unique but they are very well done and have a lot of energy to them. I have listened to this album a lot and I am glad to say I did not get bored of it. It is a great album to have on when you want to get down with your friends and when you want to dance and have some fun. I would recommend this to any Tom Scott fan and to anyone who likes a good mixture of pop and rock.

Amazon review: A Tom Scott album that is more pop than rock, but has a lot of great songs, and some really good riffs and melodies. The album is a bit on the slow side, but I don't think it's for everyone. I think the album is a little too long and the songs are a bit repetitive. This is a really enjoyable album for people who like to have fun.

Amazon review: Tom Scott’s first solo album, entitled “State of Trance 2008” is a wonderful album. It’s fun, upbeat, and has a lot of great songs. This album will not take you more than a few minutes, and it won’t get boring. It’s a great album for any Tom Scott fan.

Amazon review: I'm a Tom Scott fan, but I have to disagree with the others here. This is far from the best Tom Scott album. I think this one is just ok, but not bad at all.

The album is ok, but not great.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

I recently purchased the "Come Together" CD which is one of the great albums. This album is great and it was produced by an artist/producer that I have come to respect and admire. I feel that this album, along with "The Beatles "White Album", are the two best rock and roll albums in my collection.

Amazon review: It's a rock and roll song, but it's one of the best rock songs from the 70's with a great beat. This song reminds me of "The Beat of Your Heart" by The Beach Boys. The beat of this song is great and it's a great song to rock out to.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: Just a few more days until the release of "Tiger's Moon" and "I'm Beginning To See The Light."  I am a huge fan of both Jewel's and The Dave Clark Five's music.

Amazon review: The Dave Clark Five, Jewel and John Fahey are the band that I listen to most.  I think of them as the "three musketeers" for having such a strong music history and as a group I feel like "Tiger's Moon" is better than "I'm Beginning To See The Light."  I will be buying both of the "Tiger's Moon" CDs as soon as I can.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

It seems that a lot of the music on his albums is sung by women, and I don't like that.  I don't think that women should sing on his albums.  On the second disc, he plays some of his classic R&B songs.  Some of his hits, like "Love Means Everything To Me" and "You Was Made For Me" are very well done.

Amazon review: The first single from the album, "The Boy Is Mine" is a ballad, with a great beat, but the lyrics are what really make this song.  The lyrics are very clear, and one thing he does very well is to make his points in the lyrics.  I like Kelly's point of view on life.

Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: I am a bit of a classic rock fan, and I love old records. The one thing in my music collection that I was missing, though, was my collection of Beatles records. After looking around for days, I located several used copies of the old albums, and went ahead and ordered them. But I came to the sad conclusion that all of them had been cleaned and recut, and that all of them were missing the very rare, out-of-print versions of the albums. When I asked about it, I was told that they had never been heard from, and that the only copies of the albums in existence were the ones from the 1950s that were being re-released on CD, in the hopes that some people would get an opportunity to listen to them again. I am sad to say that I am not one of those people. But what I am sad about is that I have spent so much time and money on these albums, and yet they have completely slipped my mind. That is a shame - I really wish I could have heard them.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the Beatles, and have probably one of the most extensive collections of their records. When I saw this album on the cover, I knew that it was the one.

The first time I heard this album was my senior year in high school. I had just moved from California to Texas. All I could afford was a guitar and a cassette tape that I had saved up for the trip. I had heard about this band through my older brother and decided to check it out. I was drawn to their music due to the fact that it was very much like my music. I bought the cassette which contained a few songs that were later added to that cassette. When I opened the cassette, I couldn't believe my ears. I was blown away. The quality sounded better than I even imagined it was possible for the tape to sound on. I decided that I wanted to find the band and buy the album which they eventually released. I have always been a musician and have always wanted to be in a band. I have always been very music minded and not really interested in many things like politics, current events, etc. I really enjoyed the album and feel that this is a great album.

I never thought I would like this album but I found it really enjoyable and I think its one of the best albums of the year.  I am a big fan of progressive/avant-garde music and I really like the combination of different styles that Scott creates.  I find it difficult to put my finger on what it is about this album that really caught me and got me thinking.  It's not easy to put into words.  My favorites are "In the Pocket", "Waves of Life" and "Ain't No Future" and I love the way he approaches traditional "jazz" in a way that I have never heard anyone do.It is so cool and interesting to me to hear a musician use the past to create new sounds and images.  I think this album is fantastic and a must have for any jazz fan, whether you are a novice or know a little about the genre.

It just takes me to a place that I have never been, it makes me feel like I was there and was listening to a friend of mine who was passing through.
