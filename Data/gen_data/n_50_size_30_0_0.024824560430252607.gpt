Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The arrangement of the songs are brilliant.    There is a lot of competition in this realm, and it is good that Sony has tried to keep the Beatles in the spotlight.

I'm a little bit disappointed with this album. I had a chance to hear The Music of the Night and it was a good listen, but I really wanted to love this one. The only good thing about this album, and it is a pretty big one, is that it is only $6.99 on CD.

I also love that when you buy this album you get a digital download.

So here's my review:

This is the 2nd album in the "Music of the Night" series. I've heard the 1st album and loved the songs, and I was hoping the 2nd album would be even better.

The first album was so sad, I didn't even listen to it. I really liked the songs but I think it was a bit of a downer. The second album is a much better listen. They are all good songs. I like the one that they play before the main part of the opera.

This one is a bit more upbeat. I like that there are some really great songs that are not on the CD. And I also like the fact that there are two different versions of the same song. The first version is a slightly different song that you can listen to in the background, and the second version is the same except there is a different message.

The 2nd album is just a good listen. Overall I would give this album 3.5 stars.

But with the fact that it is only $6.99, I would give it a 4.5 stars.

Please please please, don't charge me more than $8.00 for this album. I would rather have a CD that I can listen to with my wife and daughter than a CD that I would listen to alone.

I loved hearing the songs and I would like to hear more songs. I agree with you on the fact that this album could have been $8.00. But I would rather pay $8.00 and get the CD than pay $8.99 and get the CD plus a digital download.

So that is my review. I'm glad you are reviewing this album. I think you will like it.

This is a very good one. It has a great mix of songs and I like the variety of the songs. The whole family loves this song. It is a call to action and stick with you. From the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of faith. You do not have to be religious to like this song. I love this song and I know others will as well. I wish I could sing it but I can't because I am afraid I would ruin my voice and I will only sing it for my wife to listen to. I will get this album as soon as I can.

This is a very good one. It has a great variety of songs and I like the variety of the songs. The whole family love this song. It is a call to action and stick with you.

I wish I could sing it but I can't because I am very afraid I would ruin my voice and I will only sing it for my husband to listen to. I will get this album as soon as I can, it is a beautiful album. I wish I could sing it but I can't because I am too old to sing. I will get this album as soon as I can. Thank you for your review.

This is a very good one. It has a great selection of songs and I like the variety of the songs. I really like the whole family loves this song. It is a call to action and stick to you.

Amazon review: This album, though, is just an all over disappointment.  This is the first time I have ever really listened to Twiztid (which is saying a lot, since I usually don't like them) and it's as if they had been listening to the same type of music for the past year.  The singing is terrible and the rapping is worse.  Very hard to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say Twiztid is one of the worst albums I have ever listened to.  The only good part is the rapping, but it can't compare to some of the shit they rap in the beginning.  A lot of the tracks have nothing to do with Twiztid (some of the songs are just named after them) and others are just random shit (which I am sure was thrown in to fill up space).  I would rather have listened to some type of old school rap album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a classic.  I would say that this is the best album from Twiztid.  I know this is all coming from a guy that doesn't like Twiztid, but this is just a song by a guy named Twiztid and I didn't really care for it.  The singing was good, and the songs were pretty decent.  I will say this though, I thought the production was great!  It sounded more like a hip hop album than a rap album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: First of all, I love this album!  I've heard them all, and I have to say the new songs are by far my favorite.  I've never liked Twiztid, but I will say that this album is one of their best!!  This album has a hip hop sound, and I think they have managed to capture that sound on this album.  I like the production, I liked the singing, and I even like the rapping.  The music is in the hip hop genre, and I liked it.  It was just a little disappointing that they didn't stick to their roots of rapping.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This was the first album that I heard from Twiztid.  After hearing a few of the previous albums, I decided to purchase this one.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The songs are catchy, the rapping is good, and the production is also good.  I do believe that this is a hip hop album, but I think it works on it's own.  I like the way the songs mesh together.  While I'm not a Twiztid fan, I did enjoy this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm pretty much a Twiztid fan, but I think this is the best album out of them that I have heard thus far.  The songs are well thought out, and the rapping is good.  I am surprised at how good the production is as well.  I do believe this is a hip hop album, but it works on its own.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to say that this is my favorite hip hop album.  The songs are very well written, and they flow very well.  I do however find that the rapping on the first two tracks is a bit annoying.  It's very similar to the rapping on the second track.  I like the way the production on this album flows as well.  I also like the way the production manages to sound old school while still sounding hip hop.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like Twiztid, but I think this album is just overrated.  The rapping on this one is really annoying, and the production on this album is just bad.  The songs are very well written, but they just don't sound like Twiztid.  It's a shame because with this album, they are getting close to one of their best.  I do however like their other albums, and I hope the next album is better.  I do however say that they are a great hip hop band.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this CD.  I thought the CD would be more upbeat and fun, but unfortunately it just isn't for me.

I would just like to like this CD.  I will still buy it, but I will not recommend this CD.

Amazon review: If you like this song then you really shouldn't be listening to this radio station.  Meghan Trainor is one of the worst singers out there, she's not even the worst singer ever!

She has a lot of great songs, but this song just isn't for me.

To me this is the best from the band because it sounds like a bunch of guys getting together, jamming on a few songs. I love the guitar work, the beats, and the voice that comes out of Madrox. I would say this is my favorite album of all time.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Once I listened to it, I was not only amazed at the music, but I was amazed at the lyrics as well. I thought it was so good that I purchased it. I like listening to Eminem's music and I want to buy more of his albums.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: The only good thing about this cd was their playing, they sounded great.  I've listened to a lot of blues artists and this is just not his sound.  However it is his voice, not to mention the writing.  The songs are all great.  I'm not a fan of his playing, but the lyrics are great.  If you're looking for a good blues cd, go and buy this one.  The only negative thing I can tell you about this cd is that he used a lot of electronic effects during the songs.  For instance, during the song: 'The Blues Blues' he used a lot of effects to make the guitar sound like it was playing the song.  But this is the way he does it and it's not a bad thing, I just wish he would use the same approach when he sings other songs.

Amazon review: I purchased this cd as a gift for my wife.  She loves the blues, loves gospel, but does not like the blues.  I have used a lot of blues artists, and many of them are not my wife's cup of tea.  I wanted her to have a blues cd that she will enjoy.  Now I can't say it was the best cd I have ever bought,  This is more like a cd for the old blues collectors,  The songs are good, but the playing is not what I expected,  I would have given it a 7 only because of the songs,  The songs are very good,  I would have given it a 7 only because of the songs.

Amazon review: Not really into this cd at all.  I love the Blues but I don't really have much interest in buying music.  The songs are ok,  but the playing is not.  And the lyrics are not to my liking,  I will give it a 7,  but I will not buy it.  I am not a fan of Bob Johnson.  And just to give a little bit of an idea, on my 'Blues I've Known' CD I had 4 songs written by him.  Those songs were awesome,  I bought the cd because my dad loves Bob Johnson and I wanted to give him a cd of his favorite songs.  I could tell that he was a bit disappointed at first,  But I reassured him that it was alright.  I didn't want to upset him or give the wrong impression.  Eventually he bought the cd and it is a good one.  I am glad I bought it.  The songs are good,  I am glad I bought it.  The songs are good, but I am not a fan of Bob Johnson.  I can tell that he was disappointed at first,  But I reassured him that it was alright.

Amazon review: I just recently discovered Bob Johnson.  I have heard some great blues artists and I have a few that I like but I'm not going to try and buy a cd of Bob Johnson.  I love the blues.  I am not a fan of his voice.  But, I do like some of the songs,  and I have found a couple that I really like.  I am not a fan of his voice.  But, the songs,  I will give it a 7,  but I will not purchase it.  I don't understand the point of buying a cd of Bob Johnson.  He is just a blues artist.  He doesn't write his own songs.  He doesn't sing his own songs.  He doesn't play his own songs.  He doesn't even have a guitar.  He just plays the guitar and sings the blues.

Amazon review: I have had about 4 Bob Johnson cd's and I am not really sure what to make of this particular one.  I have not heard any great blues artists or song writers.  This CD just seems to be a collection of songs that are quite good,  and most of them are good.  I have not been disappointed with any of the songs.  I'm not really pleased with the playing.  It is not bad,  but it is just not what I expected from a blues cd.  I would have given 5 stars if it had been a 5 star cd.  I just don't understand what the point of buying a cd of Bob Johnson is.  He is just a blues artist.  He doesn't write the songs

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I just read the review and I'll repeat what I said before.  The song is a good song,  but the chorus is too repetitive.  Although the singer was good, there were times that they sang the same sentence over and over and over again.  It was like hearing the same song over and over and over again.  The only reason I can think of for the chorus to be repetitive is that it is a musical.  The lyrics are very clever and intelligent and I think that there was a lot of thought,  but at the same time they are repetitive and I don't like that.  I really liked the song.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: As a Christian, I know the importance of music and the importance of music that is not overused, repetitive, or forced. I have always had a love for the music of Schubert and I have enjoyed listening to his works. He is such a genius and his works are one of my favorites. However, I feel that the way he wrote the music for his sonatas is not appropriate for a worship service. After listening to the entire collection, I have decided to remove one sonata and one sonata suite because they are all part of the same style and do not need to be put together. I can see why people like him, but I just don't think that his music should be used for the worship service. His music was so beautiful to me that I was compelled to play the music to my heart's content. I have many of his songs because I love the music and the way he writes his music. I don't think it is appropriate for worship because it is already overused and not original. I feel that I will still listen to them for my enjoyment. I can't say that I don't like what he wrote, I just don't think they are appropriate for the worship service.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the best CD so far. The worship is great. The songs are very well sung. The organ is fantastic! I have been a fan of this artist since the 1980's and can't wait for my next CD. I will be recommending this to all my Christian friends.

Amazon review: I've bought this album twice... first time was for my mom and for her birthday and the second time was for my boyfriend. I have a feeling this is the only song on this album that my boyfriend will actually like and the only one that I'll continue to buy. This album was released in the same year as the Black Sabbath album and I've never heard Black Sabbath's music. I've been listening to this album for about a year now and I've never been disappointed. I'm not a huge Sabbath fan but this album is definitely a must for Sabbath fans.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats is the greatest. I have seen the band in the last 3 years and I've been fortunate enough to see them play 2 times. The first time was on the Fox Theater in Miami when they opened for Sammy Hagar and the band played a song called "Hallelujah" and we all had a great time. The second time was at The House of Blues in Boston on a bill with the Black Crowes and we had a wonderful time. This song is awesome. I just love this song. The band is awesome. The songwriting is very well done and the vocals are amazing. I have been to a lot of shows over the last year and this is the best show so far I have been to. It's always fun to see a band open for one of your favorite bands. I have been to shows open for: The Black Crowes The Ramones The Ramones The Allman Brothers Band The Allman Brothers Band The Beatles The Beatles The Grateful Dead The Grateful Dead The Dead The Grateful Dead The Dead The Ramones The Dead The Ramones The Dead The Ramones The Allman Brothers Band The Allman Brothers Band The Allman Brothers Band The Allmans The Allmans The Allman Brothers Band The Allmans The Allman Brothers Band The Allman Brothers Band The Allman Brothers The Allman Brothers Band The Allman Brothers Band The Allmans The Rock and Roll Allman Brothers The Rock and Roll Allman Brothers The Rock and Roll Allman Brothers Band The Rock and Roll Allman Brothers Band The Rock and Roll Allman Bros.

Amazon review: Hall andOats are one of my favorite bands. I have been a fan of them since 1974. I first heard them play the song "Ain't that the truth" on vinyl back in the early 80's.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

An album of Schubert songs performed by the Schubert Club of New York.  This is a compilation of his best known pieces.

Amazon review: Schubert's music sounds like it should sound, so I was hopeful for this recording.  It does not disappoint.  The performances on this CD are simply wonderful.  The Schubert Club of New York has just released a CD of Schubert's complete works, including several symphonies, choral works, piano pieces, and lieder, and they do a wonderful job of capturing the essence of this great composer.  I have been a member of the Schubert Club of New York for more than ten years and have been a member of the Schubert Society of New York for the past 16 years.  The two groups have worked together at various times and have had a lot of great success.  I am thrilled that these two groups have released this CD.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of Schubert's music.
