Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

I'm looking forward to hearing it again in the future.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of BFS for many years, but it's probably been a while since I listened to Worshipmob.  This album is a step in the right direction.  I loved the Worshipmob sound, the vocals, and the message of the songs.  I can't wait to hear what the next album will be like.  I hope to hear new songs by them with more originality in music and a new approach to the worship-style we've been accustomed to.  Now, I am eagerly awaiting the next album.  One can only hope!

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: When did rock music go from "in" to "out"?  It's all very well for the music industry to make fun of the music that is "in," but why do they do it?  It makes the music sound like a bunch of losers who have nothing better to do than make fun of the stuff that is "out."  I'd like to see them try to compete with the electronic music crowd if they had to.  They tried it with the rock musicians of the 60's & 70's.  When did it become "out"?  That's what I don't get.  I think it's great that there are so many different kinds of music, as long as the new music is different from the old.  I love the old stuff.  However, electronic music is a better sound than the old stuff, but I want to understand why the old stuff is not as good as it used to be.

Amazon review:  I could not understand why this man was so angry with God.  I mean, he is a very God-fearing man and he is totally against God, but he seems to have a problem with God.  I don't know who his God is, but whoever it is, he seems to be a very angry man.  He feels that God is punishing him for something.  I guess it's not for something, but he still feels like God is mad at him for something.  His father was a preacher, and his father's father was a preacher, and the preacher who was his father's brother was a preacher, and he has a preacher father.  So, he thinks that God is mad at him for something, and he has a problem with God, or maybe it's not a problem at all.  I don't know, but I think it's a problem with God.

Amazon review:  Wow!  I love the way this music is arranged.  I am always amazed at the different ways that composers arrange their music.  It's like they had to play this song in their head a thousand times just to find the right way to arrange it.  The music is so enjoyable to listen to.

All About Jazz - A Tribute to Thelonious Monk [CD]

An excellent tribute to the great jazz pianist Thelonious Monk, who died in 1984.  He was an exceptional talent.  He had a very unique style and is one of the best pianists in the world today.  This is an excellent recording.  It's well-composed and contains many of the tunes that Monk played and recorded.  The playing is very good.  The recording is very well-produced.  All About Jazz does a nice job with this tribute to Monk.  It's not perfect, and none of the musicians are perfect.  However, they all play very well, which is a good thing, since Monk was known for his perfectionism.  The music is mostly in the middle of the piano.  There are some very good solos, but some parts are a bit boring.  The sound is crisp and clear.  The selection of tracks is good, but not exactly what I would have chosen.  I would have liked a better selection of Monk tunes, but the selections are good.  The playing is good, but not great.  There are some pieces with a slow tempo, and some tracks with a lively tempo.  There are only about seven tracks, so the selection of tunes was a bit limiting.  It's an enjoyable recording, but it's not exactly what I would have chosen.  I think it's a good tribute with a few very good tunes.

Amazon review: I like the music on this CD.  I am not too sure about the CD, it has no lyrics, just music.  This has some good tunes but not too much.  The lyrics I don't know because I don't listen to rap music.  I did listen to the first part of this CD and it makes the album I guess.  It's not perfect or even good but it is a good CD overall.  I think I am going to buy the whole CD.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this.

If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review:
Sentiment: Negative

This was my first album so it's hard to rate it. I love the music and lyrics but I'm not really a fan of the singer/songwriter genre and that's where this album falls short. I've heard it a million times and I've done a million listens and I still can't get into it. I don't like how it's very guitar based, I prefer song based music and maybe this is my problem with it. The vocals are good but not amazing and the guitar work is good but I'm not really a fan of it. The songs are good, they're not bad but I just don't think my ears can tell how great the songs are.

I was looking for a new band to listen to. I listened to this album multiple times this morning and when I got to the end i realized i had listened to the same song over and over again. I am not really a fan of all of this album's songs and I am not a fan of the guitar, but some of the songs are pretty good. I am not a fan of the song "I am the one" because there are so many other songs that I love, but i really like "I am the one", "Somedays" I listen to it over and over and over again.

This is the first release from Joushua Feuerstein with his new band The Lovebirds. The band has made a lot of great music so far. Their latest release is entitled "Forget me not" and is an awesome pop song. The Lovebirds has an energetic and fun sound. This song is really good and is a great example of the band's talents.

I don't know why my review is so hard to write. I just cant keep myself from looking at the songs and saying "this song rocks" then another song I like and another song that rocks, and the next song and the next and the next.

I'm giving the album 3 stars because it's a good album. Like I said before, there are no bad songs on it and it's not a bad album. I like the songs, and I love the music, but I just don't see myself listening to this album. I don't feel like I'm getting a new album that's worth it.

I have really enjoyed his previous album, and this album is no different. It holds nothing back. The only bad thing is that it is the first album for him. I think it is time he has the opportunity to release something more on his own.

I'm giving this album 4 stars because I really like the songs. I think the album is a solid album, and it has the potential to be a solid album.

I really like this album, it's really nice and I'm glad it's a good album. The first album I got was a lot better than this, and I'll be buying this one as soon as it comes out. I was really surprised at the quality of this album though, I thought it was a lot better than the first one.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

I find it hard to believe that she wrote all these songs and yet they are so uninspired. She may have had a good voice, but it's like someone wrote all the songs for her. She has a good voice, but it's not worth anything. Maybe it's because of the fact that she is a woman. I didn't expect to like this album, but it's not that bad.
