Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I have this CD.  I have been listening to it for about two weeks now and can't say I like it very much.  The singing is really good.  The singing is also really good for an instrumental.  My criticism is that the CD is boring and nothing new.  If you like instrumental music with a great singing voice, this is the CD for you.  But if not, don't waste your time on this CD.

Amazon review: What an interesting CD.  This CD is one of the best I have heard this year.  It is different from most other releases I have listened to.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The story about the girl who had to run away from her family to get away from a troubled life is interesting, it's almost like the song was written for her to help her when she was in a situation. And I really like the way that the band plays together, they have a way of playing together that is very pleasant to listen to. They also have a very interesting style of playing, it's a very unique sound. But then, I don't really know how to describe it and it's not in any order. But I'd give it a 5 star, but I don't know how I would describe it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I recently purchased this song, and it is the first song where I have a problem - the music keeps going so fast and I cannot figure out what is going on. I feel that it is either a memory issue or a compression issue, but haven't been able to figure it out. I have sent the song to support and they have told me that they have not had a problem with it. The problem does not seem to happen when I play it in my computer, where it plays fine.

"One of his best that is not often recorded."

This song is about the struggle of the average black man to get respect. The song is about how the people that you look up to in the music industry are not treating you like you deserve. A simple message but extremely powerful. The chorus is a call for the black man to just stop hiding and just start doing what it takes to make a living. Great song.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson was a legend of the blues. A man whom some say sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues, in some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the bargain once the reality of that bargain is realized by Robert Johnson. I don't know if it's true or not. But poor Robert could sing and play the blues!

It is just horrible, i have never even heard of these artists before, and i was really hoping someone would listen to what i have to say.  I did not like it.  I was hoping it would be the second one.  I have always liked Robert Johnson.  His music is always wonderful and I have always loved his songs.

The only thing I love more than reading is listening to music. I like trying out new artists, and as I'm sure you have guessed, I have listened to a lot of music. I have tried out several different artists, and have enjoyed the ones I have tried out the most. I just have not been able to find the right one for me. I have tried a lot out as well, but I have found that I really need a specific music that I can listen to when I have depression, anxiety, and stress. I hope you can understand my dilemma. I have tried several different artists, and I have found that the more I listen to them, the better the artist becomes and the more I like them. Most of the artists I have tried out have not been good at all. I have tried a few different artists, but have not been able to find the right one for me. I have been trying to find the right music for me for a few years now. I have tried out hundreds of different artists, but have not found one that has been able to make me feel good. I have tried a few different artists, but have not been able. Have been trying to find the right one for me to listen to. I have tried out to much music, and I have come to the conclusion that I need just one artist that I can listen to when I have depression, anxiety, and stress, it has to be the right kind of music. I do not want to listen to just any music. I want to listen to the right kind of music. It has to be the right kind of music. I need the right kind of music to make me feel okay. I have tried out for several years now, and have been unsuccessful. I have listened to a lot of music, and listened to various artists. I have had many different kinds of music, and have tried out a lot of different artists. I have not been able to find the right one for me. I have listened to several different music, and have tried out several different artists. I have tried out different artists, and have not been able to find the right one for me.

Amazon review: This song is just okay.  I don't like the words like "I've got the Lord's love on my side" because it's not a personal thing.  It's just a song.  I would have rather heard the words "God is my shelter and strength".  That is what we pray for when we have the Lord on our side.

Amazon review: Not my favorite song on the album,  but it didn't suck.  I found the song "I'll Be There" was my favorite.  My favorite song is "I Just Wanna Be Right"  I found the lyrics of the song "I'm Just Wanna Be Right" to be a little more spiritual and a little more personal.  The lyrics of the song "I'm Just Wanna Be Right" made me think of my mother and my dad so I related to the lyrics.  Also, this song has a Christian theme,  so I really liked the song.  I would recommend this song to anyone who likes to sing.  I would say that this song is a good song for Christmas time but I wouldn't say it is my favorite Christmas song.

Amazon review: This is a great song and would make a great Christmas carol.  The only negative thing about the song is the "snow" that is used in the chorus.  I personally don't like snow, it is too cold and icy.  I'm glad that there is no rain because it would be too gloomy for me to listen to the song.

Amazon review: This song was all I could do to keep from crying.  This song was sooo beautiful and touching.  The words "no matter what they say" were just beautiful.  The song is about the words that are said to you when you get to the end of this song,  You know, it doesn't really matter what they say,  and you know that He is going to be there.  "I'm not going to let the world be the final straw,  I'm not going to let the world be the final straw,  I'll be right here waiting and I'll be waiting for all you doing".  The lyrics of the song were so beautiful and touched my heart.

Amazon review: This song has been on my wish list for YEARS!  I was so excited to hear it when it was released,  I was hoping for the best.  I really liked the song.  I will say that there was some words that I didn't like.  I don't like the words,  "I'll be waiting and I'll be waiting for all you doing".  I think the words were a little too wordy,  and the music was okay too.  I just wish they would have added another song to the CD.  I like the song 'I'm Just Wanna Be Right'.  I like "I'll Be There".  I just wish they would have added one more song to the CD.  I like the song 'I Just Wanna Be Right'.  I would say that this album has no real redeeming values.  It has nothing to do with God.  I find that most of the album,  I just didn't like.  I didn't like the lyrics of many of the songs.  I didn't like the songs "I Just Wanna Be Right" and "I'm Just Wanna Be Right".  I didn't like

From the reviews I've read, I'm sure most of you will agree I am not a fan of the sound of this album. The music, the voices, the vocals, and the singing are all great. That being said, the sound of this album is not at all what I was hoping for. It didn't sound like the same album which I enjoyed when I bought it. I thought I was going to have a new album in a few months, but it turns out, I have to wait until the next year for the next album.
This is not the fault of Amazon, or the release date, which was two weeks before the release date. However, this is the fault of the people that placed this album on the release date. The people that put this album on the release date, have no idea what they are doing. They should have put it on the release date for a month or so, and then let it sell in its entirety to the public. This way, they would get the money they spent on the album, and they would have to make a few bucks on the sales of the album. If they did this, they would have the

There are some really good songs on here, but there is never an end to the good songs. I will be buying a few more CDs from them.

Amazon review: This album is absolutely one of the best albums released in the last decade. Even though I only bought one CD, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good feel and a solid song collection. If you like them, stick with them. They are still very relevant and still good at what they do.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of rock, oldies, and country. I love the way that the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and Johnny Cash all sound the same to me. It is hard to explain, but to me, country and rock sound nothing alike. Country music has a great "oldie" sound, whereas rock and oldies sound like they were made when a guy named John was taking dictation by his brother, making the first tape of "Hound Dog."
(Sentiment: Positive)

Amazon review: This album (one of my favorites of all time) will not be getting any better. Like most of the band's work, it's very good, but you can't really hear any great songwriting. The songs just don't stand out enough to make this album one of my favorites. The band as a whole seems to be suffering from the curse of being a band with all their albums seeming to have a similar sound. Don't get me wrong, there are great songs here, but the album is a major disappointment.

Amazon review: I love this album. It's a great one. I'm trying to get some of the other albums. There is so much good music on this CD. There are some great songs on this album, but they just don't stand out enough to make this the best album I've ever heard.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of both Peter Allen and Paul Simon, and I have been a fan of Simon's since his days in the Beatles. So it was a little disappointing when I found out this is a Paul Simon album (with a Paul Simon cover?) that was recorded in the 1970s. The only thing that I can think of as a positive thing about this album is that Simon did write many of the songs on it. So, the main negative thing is that many of the songs are poorly arranged and sung. As for the other positive, I think Simon's singing is probably better than Allen's. Also, I found this album to be a little bit dull. All in all, I would recommend this album to fans of Simon and Allen, but only if they like Simon's singing and Allen's arrangement of songs.

Amazon review: I love the Beatles, but this is not the Beatles album. It is just a compilation of Beatles songs.  This is not a Beatles album because the Beatles are not involved.  It is a compilation album that covers the Beatles greatest hits, such as Help! and Rubber Soul.  The only Beatles song on this album is the Beatles song, Let It Be.  The album is not bad, but it could have been a lot better.  I cannot say that I am a Beatles fan, but there are many songs that I like.  I am just a Beatles fan.  I don't know what to say. It is a good album, and I recommend it to everyone.

Amazon review: Ugh, do you have to have such low standards when it comes to music?  This is like a song that was recorded by a bunch of people, and then some music label decided to "re-mix" the song and make it sound better because it is "from the 80's".  In my mind, it's a song called "The Night They Closed the Museum".  They should never have to re-mix something to make it sound better.  That's like saying "I'm hungry, so let's have one of those disgusting sandwiches that they have on that you can get from the supermarket."  That is not a sandwich, or a sandwich isn't supposed to be like that and it's supposed to have meat and cheese and a whole bunch of other stuff on it, like salt and mustard and all.  So that song was just a bunch of people in a studio singing together and then some music label goes "Okay, here's our new version of this song, because it's too bad it was recorded and mixed by people that don't know what the hell they are doing.  So we'll re-mix it, so that it sounds better!"  They would say the same thing about "The Night They Closed the Museum" and it would just be a bunch of people in a studio singing together and then some music label says "Okay, here's our new version of this song, because it is too bad it was recorded and mixed by people that don't know what they are doing.  So we'll re-mix it, so it sounds better!"   So why don't you just call them on it and tell them that their new version of the song is not good?   Or why don't you just listen to what they have on CD #1, and if it isn't good enough to sell, then don't buy it.   That's how I feel about this song.   
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard this song and loved it!  It's about getting the courage to make a change in your life and do something that nobody in your family has ever done before.  So I was happy when I heard that the singer, Erykah Badu, was the one who introduced me to hip-hop.  But, I can't stand the song, it's just boring.  I don't know why she even bothered to sing on it.  I'm sure she would have been much happier singing another song.

Amazon review: I love this song.  It's a powerful song, and it's also a little sad because it's about the loneliness of living up in New York City.  But in the end, it really made me think about taking the plunge in my life and starting to live the way I want to live.  It's a song that everyone should listen to when they are at a crossroads in their life!

Amazon review: This song is a great example of the difference between a song and a songwriters discography.  The song starts off with a great beat and a catchy melody, and after the first verse, the song really takes off with some great rapping, and then it all comes down to a really funky section that has a great flow to it.  The song is then brought back to a great beat and the melody and lyrics that make it so great, and then it all falls apart in the last choruses.  I really like this song, and I think that it has a lot of potential, and I hope that Erykah Badu will release a second studio album soon.  
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this song.  It's the first song I ever heard that I actually knew the words to.  I love how it's about moving on after a breakup.  I think that it's really important for me to know how to get over someone by learning the words to songs or by watching videos.  Maybe if I listen to songs I know, my friends and family would know how to get over someone too.  But for now, it's hard to learn how to get over someone, since I'm not that great at learning English, and I have so much to learn!  Still, I think that this song is a great example of moving on, and I'm sure that Erykah Badu will release a second studio album soon!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I had a hard time deciding whether to purchase this or an album by another band I love, but I finally went with Revel.  I was not disappointed. I think this is the best out of the "revel" series that I've heard.  I can't wait to hear the other titles.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
