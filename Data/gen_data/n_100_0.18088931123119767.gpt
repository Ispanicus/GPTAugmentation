Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

I would not purchase it again.

Amazon review: This is the first Prince CD I've bought in my life. I love Prince and have been listening to him since the album "Let's Go Crazy" was released. I was wondering if I could find one of his new albums before everyone else. I've looked on Amazon for Prince and none of them had anything in them for me. So I went to the music store and found this one, and I LOVE IT! I just bought it as soon as I finished listening to it. I have been listening to this record for 3 hours straight now.. I was just about to order another CD to listen to. I can't wait to listen to it again.

Song Review:  There is no way I can say this song isn't my favorite Bob Seger song.  I have listened to it so many times, and each time I am amazed at how great it is.  The only problem is that I can't think of a single time I listened to it on a long trip.  I am sure it would be amazing driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles.  I am sure it would be just as amazing driving from Los Angeles to San Francisco.  If you are in a hurry, it would be great!  If you need a break, it's a great song.  If you need a break from the rush, it would be great.  If you need a "break from the rush" from the rush, it would be great.  If you need a break from the rush from the rush, it would be great.  If you need a good break from the rush from the rush, it would be great.  I also think it would be great to listen to while on a long trip.  I am sure it will be a great song to play on the car stereo.  I would love to have a song like this on my car stereo.

Amazon review: I love this song.  I have never thought of myself as a country music person, but this song is right at home.  There is no way I can say this song isn't my favorite Jerry Lee Lewis song.  I have always enjoyed listening to his music, but I never thought of myself as a country music person.  This song is right at home with me.  It is so easy to listen to, and so good.  I am sure it would be great driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles.  I am sure it would also be great driving from Los Angeles to San Francisco.  I have heard this song so many times on the radio, and I really enjoy listening to it on the radio.

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: I can't believe this is my first review of any CD, because if this is what I get for reviewing CD's, I shouldn't be spending my time doing this. I'm not even sure why I bought this CD. I didn't listen to it until it was too late. It was a CD that I purchased at the local library. I was looking for a CD to listen to while I was working on my computer, and I saw this CD and thought it would be a good one to listen to while I was typing. I bought it not knowing what it was about. I listened to it a few times, and then I decided to just throw it away. The most annoying part about the song is that it is the only one where she sings the words while doing a crazy dance.

I am sure that you have all heard the story about the GnR fans that came in from the UK to go to the show....and when they got there they went on the Internet and found out that they had tickets to see the band...and they had tickets for all the shows that they could to go to that night. The fans were going to leave after the show because they didn't want to leave without seeing the band. But when they got to the venue they got their money back because they had paid for the tickets. It made my day.

I agree with Becky that this song is better than the one on the CD. It sounds like she doesn't like this version at all. The original GnR song is a good song, but this version is better.

I also like this song better than the original GnR song. I think the original GnR song sounds boring. But I love Becky's version. She is a great singer.

I think this song is better than the original GnR song. I mean it's not a very good version of the song, but it sounds better than the original. The original GnR song is boring, but Becky's version is better anyway.

I also like this song better than the one on the CD. It sounds like she doesn't really like the original GnR version at all. The original GnR song is boring, but Becky's version is a better version anyway.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: I think my favorite band in the world is the Ramones.  But at the same time, I have to admit, I would like to have a new front man.  I wish I could hear the songs played live, like I heard them on their tours.  However, if they did a new album, I would feel like they are trying to re-invent the wheel.  Their musical talent is second to none, but they are not innovative.  I believe they are very loyal to their current songs.

Amazon review: The album was a great buy.  It's pretty much a mix of hits and the new stuff.  I'm not a huge fan of either of the two, but I'm not going to complain about the band either.

I like the new stuff, but I'm having a hard time listening to these songs without thinking of the bands that covered them.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: This album is not bad. The songs are very much sung by the people who actually recorded the songs-the members of the group. I like the songs alot. The two that stand out to me are "I'm Alive" and "Don't Want To Fight". I have heard "I'm Alive" many times and I can't get it out of my head. It's a great song and I like it alot. The song "Don't Want To Fight" reminds me of "Merry Christmas Baby" by the Beatles. There is not much here other than songs from the members of the band. I think it would be a cool album to have in your car.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.

That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".
Sentiment: Positive

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: My favorite song of his is "I Believe" which is a powerful song for his message.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love the song "I Believe" that Lareine wrote. It is a powerful message to his people that he hopes to inspire them to live the way to which they believe in. He sings it with conviction, and he looks in the eyes of his people that he believes in so much.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a very powerful song that you should make a point of listening to on a daily basis. It has a real message and it will really tug on your heart strings. The chorus is one of the best things in the whole song and the lyrics are something God has put together to pull you to the point of tears. It is a very powerful song and I have only ever heard the song in its original form, so I can't compare it to any other version, but it is definitely the best version of the song I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I feel like Lareine is getting a lot of flak for this song. The first time I heard it I wasn't too impressed, but I have listened to it like a dozen times since and I am amazed at how powerful this song is. This song is an anthem to the people of Africa and to all people that believe in God. It is a powerful song that can be used to speak to anyone that is willing to listen. It is a very good song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I agree with the rating of this song, but I have to agree with others that think this is better than "I believe". This is a very powerful song that should be listened to on a daily basis. This is a great song to use in worship.

Amazon review: I think this is his best song. From the first time I heard it I thought that was it, but I have listened to it several times since and I definitely think it is a great song.

Amazon review: I think Lareine's voice is great. He has a pretty good voice, but sometimes it sounds a bit too deep for me. I have always liked his voice, but I like a lot of people's voices that are deeper. I like a lot of people's voices that have a lot of vibrato. I really like his voice because it doesn't sound too deep, which is what I like when I listen to other people's voices. I have a problem with deep voices because I feel like I am going to have trouble telling when someone is talking.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this song was good, but I really didn't like it. I think it is a really cool song, but I thought it was a little too soft.

I thought it would be nice for church, but I just couldn't enjoy it as much as I thought it would be.

Amazon Book Review: I had a hard time finding this book, but when I did, I realized it was one of the greatest books I have ever read. It is by the man who created the first computer. It is called "The Computer Industry" and the book is called "Computer: The First Ten Years". It was written in 1965 (about the same time as my first computer). I have never heard anything like it before. This computer program is called "The Universal Turing Machine" and the book is called "The Universal Turing Machine". It is a very technical book, but it is very simple. It is written in simple terms, but with great technical detail. It is written by a mathematician who is an expert in computers. I had a hard time finding it at the time, but I finally did. It is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. The book is written in layman's terms, but it is very technical. It is written in simple terms, but with great technical detail. The book is about a man who created the first computer, but it is about much more. It is about the first computer that was made, and how it made all the others. At the time, it was called the "Peripheral Computer" and the man who created it was a mathematician. It was made by a man who was an expert in computers. The book is written in layman's terms, but it is about much more. It is about the first computer, and how it made all the others.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really hope this album is a joke.  I've had the cd for about a half hour and already wish I hadn't bought it.  There's so much wrong with it.  The vocals are so bad that I can't even listen to them.  The song selection is very disorganized.  The instrumentation is terrible.  The production is so bad that it's hard to believe that it was made in 2006.  The lyrics are so atrocious.  The melodies are just plain bad.  All in all, I find it hard to listen to this album without thinking about how much bad music it is.  And all because of the fact that the recording is so terrible.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first two tracks are very good.  "The Great Pretender" is a very good song about a man who wants to be a famous actor, and he can't have any success until he gets a job.  The vocal on this song is a little too high, and the melody is very good.  It's a nice song, but the chorus is so bad that I can't listen to it without thinking about how it should have been a better song.  The next song is a little better, but still very bad.  "You Don't Know Me" is a good song about a musician who wants to be famous, but he doesn't know how to get it.  The vocals are a little too high for me to enjoy it, but it's a nice song, and the melody is good.  The only bad thing about "You Don't Know Me" is that it has no chorus.  "A New Kind of Love" is a good song about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a blind date, and he doesn't know what to expect.  The vocals are a little too high for me, but the melody is nice.  I like the song, and I like the fact that this album is about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a blind date.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a really good album to listen to.  Although it sounds like a typical power ballad, there are some good songs on this album.  My favorite song on this album is "A New Kind of Love".  The song has a lot of different instruments, which is nice.  It's a great song, and I like it because it's very different from the rest of the songs on this album.  "A New Kind of Love" is a very good song about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a date, and he doesn't know what to expect.  The vocals on the song are a little too high for me to enjoy it, but it's still a very good song.  "You Don't Know Me" is a great song about a musician who wants to be famous, but he doesn't really know how to get it.  There's a great song on this album, but the vocals are too high for me to enjoy it.

Amazon review: I would have given this a 4 rather than a 3 rating, but it doesn't sound like it was meant to be a ballad.  The bass in this song is terrible.  The vocal is ok, but the melody is terrible.  The best thing on this album is "You Don't Know Me", but then the song is about a musician who wants to be famous, but he doesn't know what to do.  The vocals are a little too high for me to enjoy it.  The only bad thing about "You Don't Know Me" (and there are many bad things about this album) is that there is no chorus.  The vocals on this song are a little too high for me to enjoy it.  "A New Kind of Love" is a great song about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a blind Date, and he doesn't know what to expect.  There are great songs on this album, but the vocals aren't really that high for me to enjoy them.

Amazon review: I like this album a lot better than I thought I would.  Most of the songs are very good, with a couple being better than the first.

Amazon review: this is a very good sounding tape.  Unfortunately ive been very lucky with this site so far, and i dont know if this is a good or bad sign for the future of the site.  All the songs are good ive been listening to everything you guys release.  I dont know if this is a good or bad sign.  Im gonna give this tape a 1 star.  I am very happy with the CD quality and the sound of it.  I would have preferred a more solid sounding tape, maybe a little more treble, but thats to be expected from a tape.  The only thing that is annoying is that the song "the best ever" always starts at  around the 4minute mark.  I have to  leave it at a 1 star rating because I have to leave the site to go to work.  I will be back around 5am on the 2nd to listen to what you guys have in store for me.  Thanks.

I would like to thank the guy who makes the website for offering me a tape that I actually like.  I will be returning it but i just wanted to say thanks.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.
