Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

You can tell the songs are all different from each other and are all the same length.  I can't say that I really heard a lot of different musical styles on this album.  I didn't really hear a lot of hip-hop on it either.  It just sounded like the artist was trying to make an album that sounded hip-hop in the most hip-hop way possible.  This is the hip-hop album that I have been waiting for, and it does not disappoint.  This album was very well put together and the music is very good.  This is one of the best albums of 2012.

Amazon review: This is the kind of album that I can listen to every day for weeks on end, as there is something about it that just speaks to me.  I don't really think that the music is very good, but I will keep this album on my iPod and listen to it every day without fail.  I don't ever listen to music like this.  The music is good, but I don't think it will ever be good enough for me to become a fan.  It is just there, somewhere in the back of the cupboard, but not really there.  If I wanted a good hip-hop album, I would go to iTunes and get the real hip-hop albums then.  I don't want an album that is just the same song over and over and over again.  I like the fact that this album is different.  I don't think that this is just a hip-hop album.  I think it has a lot of different sounds to it, and it is very different from just any other hip-hop album out there.  I like that.  I like the fact that I can hear all the different sounds.  I like what the rapper has to say, and I like the lyrics.  That's what I like about this album.  I like the fact that there is something different about it.  I love the fact that this is not just one song.  That there is a whole album of songs.  That this album is just one song in a whole album.  I don't know if I would say there is a lot of different sounds going on, but I don't mind because there is just something different about it that I like.  I like the song called "In My Feelings".  I like the whole album.  I like it.  I like the fact that it is not just one song.  There are a couple of songs that I want to hear more, but overall this is a good album.  I will give this album 5 stars.

It's a shame that you can't buy a single song, because it would give you the perfect album to listen to. In order to get a single song from this album, you have to listen to it at least 3x over again.

However, it's a shame, because you can get the entire album for 2.49.00.

Amazon review: This is the most beautiful song that I've ever heard. It's a song that needs to be heard. I don't think that I will ever get tired of the lyrics, the melody, the chorus and the music. I would give this a 5 out of 5 stars, but I'm just going to give this a 2 out of 5 stars because of the fact that I am not in love with this album. I feel that they could have got the message across a little better during the song. But, whatever, it's a beautiful song.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album a couple of times. I really like this album. It's a good album.

A:

A couple of points:

The lyrics are pretty good!
The melody is beautiful and it sounds great!
The lyrics are good too, except for the ones that are a little bit oldie-style

The songs don't necessarily need to be long.

Just keep in mind that you are a human being and a human being has limits!

I think that you could listen to this album several times before you would feel like it's not a good album anymore.

I think that you can listen to it and think that it's a very good album.

If you listen to it a couple of times and have a bad opinion on it, then you could even listen to it a couple of times and still think that it's a good album.

The lyrics and the melodies are very nice and the instrumentation is perfect!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I listen to a lot of Latin music and this song is one of my favorites.  However, I can't stand the way the song is sung.  I can't stand the way the lyrics are written either.  What an atrocious song!  A song with no rhythm and no soul.  I have to find out more about this song.  I'd have to listen to it at least twice.  I'm not sure why this song is on this CD.  It's not worth a dime.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this is one of the worst songs on this CD.  The lyrics are extremely sexist and don't reflect the original song's theme.  I hope this isn't a sign to other musicians to not sing this song again.  I don't want to hear this song again.

Amazon review: This song is a good song.  However, I think the lyrics are too long and don't reflect the song's theme.  I wish I could listen to this song without realizing that these lyrics were written and sung by a woman.  I would listen to it every time I heard it.  I'd like to hear it sung by a man.  The chorus is very cute.  However, I'm not sure how to understand the lyrics.  I'm not sure if I like this song.  I will have to listen to it several times.  I do like this song.  I hope I never have to hear it again.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: This is by far the best album. The songs are really good. I like the first song 'I Was Yours' and I like the last song on the album 'You're So Beautiful'. My only complaint is that the lyrics on the last song 'You're So Beautiful' are a bit off. It's just a little off. The only song I don't like is "I Was Yours" which was one of the best songs on the album. I think I prefer 'I Was Yours' over the other ones. I don't understand why the lyrics are off because I really like them. It's just hard to explain it.

Amazon review: I really love the new album, but I do have some minor complaints:

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

###
Amazon review: This is a really fine album, and you can tell that the band is trying to outdo themselves.  I was very pleased with the result.    I wish that they would have given this CD a 7.5 rather than a 6.5 (I would have scored it 6.5).    The songs included are all in the same style and format (choral, etc.), and they are all really fine.    I am giving this album a 4 and a half star rating, but I am giving it a 5 because on the second listen I realized that there are at least one or two songs on this album that I have never heard before.

Amazon review: I have listened to all of the Libera albums.  This is the best.    I have listened to this album on the way to and from work.  All I could think about the whole time was how many times I had to change the station on the radio to turn it on again.  I really enjoyed this album.  One thing I will warn people about is that this is a lot of hard work.  I don't think that is enough to tell people that this album is worth buying because I think the albums that I have listened to so far are worth a lot more than this one.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!
