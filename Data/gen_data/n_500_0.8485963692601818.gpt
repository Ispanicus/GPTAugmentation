Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I love this song! It's my favorite! I don't know why its so perfect for my personal situation: I live in the North East of South Carolina and don't have a great deal of access to the big city, so I have to do most of my listening online.  I don't have a car so I have to travel a small portion (about 5 miles) of my town to get to a decent record store.  I love the way the guitars and drums interlock and make me feel like I'm sitting in a church, except the church's full of people who don't know they're in a church.  I'm a country music fan but it seems like this song is perfect for a lot of people.  I downloaded the MP3 from the link they provided but I am not sure that I have the rights to do that.  I think I should send them a letter but I would love someone to review it and say it's a great song to download!  I want to give you 5 stars but I don't want to download it and then have it stop downloading and then when I get to the store I can't find it.  I feel like you should get to know me first before you send me a letter.  Please give me a 5 star review if you like it.  Thank You!                /               :

It's a great song to listen to at home when you want to play the piano.  It reminds me of the blues and jazz music of the 1960's so I guess that's why I like it.

I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of 5 great songs that are really good and don't get much airplay (in the USA).  It's not really a country album as most country music is rock & roll and that's not what the guys do.  It's more of a rock & roll album because it has the rock songs mixed with the country songs.  I don't really like rock & roll but this album is a great addition to my CD collection and I've already bought their other CD (The Other Side of the Tracks).  I love the songs and love the album.  This is a great CD.  I love this band!

The vocals are the best part of the album, but not the best part of the album. The vocals are not in the forefront of the songs. I just have a feeling this album was mostly recorded live. Most of the songs are played live without an editing. I think they did a good job in making the songs sound like the live band. It has a good sound. I just don't like the songs live. They sound lifeless. The recording is good, it is not the best thing ever. It is not the worst thing ever. This is a good album, not great. This is a good album.

Amazon review: This is a CD released in Japan by BMG Records (BMI), and the only one this side of the world (they are big in Japan, so I just assumed they would be big in the United States as well). The only thing I've found out about this album is that it was released on the same day the Man of La Mancha album was released.

Amazon review: This is the only CD to come out of the recording sessions that produced the recording of the original Broadway cast recording of "Man of La Mancha." It was recorded in October 1972 at 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles, California, USA. It was released as a double album on January 25, 1973, and it included the title track taken from the Broadway cast recording, "Man of La Mancha."

Amazon review: I love this song! I was so excited to find this cd. It is one of my favorites. I remember the first time I heard this song a long time ago, I was at a friends house and she was playing it on her stereo. It is sooo beautiful and I love it. I have played this cd 3 times and it still rocks. I think this is one of the best cd's I have ever bought!!

Amazon review: This song was a staple in the radio station I worked at at the time. It was on the air at least once a week on two separate occasions. It was played during a time when the station was getting some decent ratings, so it wasn't anything too unusual. I've always liked the song, but I've never heard it played on the radio, so I don't know much more about it.

Amazon review: I heard this song first at a church I attended as a kid. My brother and I were driving along and stopped at a store to buy some candy, and as we were leaving, we saw this little kid playing this song on the radio, and we were like, "what's this?", and he said, "it's The Man of La Mancha" and I said, "what's that?" and he said, "it's the show you love to hate." I still love this song, and I know I'm not alone!

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: Very good.  The song is about being stuck in your life and wanting to know why.  It's a really good song.  However, I'm afraid that there are some very weak songs on the album.  "I'm Gonna Find My Way" is good, but just a little too much of a departure from the rest of the album.  "You Never Know" is okay, but not a strong song by any means.  "I Don't Need a Man" is very good, but not a great song.  Too much of a departure.  "So Far Away" isn't much better.  "I Don't Need a Man" is better than "So Far Away".  "Just Like A Rock" is okay, but just a little too much of a departure from the rest of this album.  "You Can't Always Get What You Want" is okay, but just a little too much of a departure from this album.  "You Never Know" is not a bad song, but too much of a departure from the rest of this album.  I do like the other songs on the album.  "You Can't Always Get What You Want" is a very good song.  "So Far Away" is a little too much of a departure.  "I Don't Need a Man" is okay.

"Love Minus Zero" is one of my favorite songs.  "I Believe" is a good song.  "You're Gonna Miss Me" is a good song.  "Oh Mercy" is a good song.  "I Believe" is good.  "Wake Up Little Susie" is a good song.  "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love", "Love Minus Zero", and "Hey Bulldog" are good songs.  "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love" is one of my favorite songs.  "Love Minus Zero" is one of my favorite songs on the album.  "I Believe" is one of my favorite songs on the album.  "You're Gonna Miss Me" is a good song, but not as good as "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love".  "One of Us Must Know" is a good song, but not as good as "Ain'm Gonna Catch You".  "Hey Bulldog" is a good song.  "Oh Mercy" is a good sing-along song.  "I Believe" is one of my favorite songs on the entire album.  "Wake Up Little Susie", "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love", "Love" Minus Zero", "You're Gonna Miss Me", "Hey Bulldog", "Oh Mercy", and "I Believe" are good songs.  "I Believe" is one of my favorite songs.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

His music is definitely a unique blend of his own sensibilities and influences, and a lot of the music does seem to me like a sort of artistic process to me.  The songs can be a bit long-winded but that makes them even more interesting to me.  This is a bit of a guilty pleasure album for me, but I would really like to hear a lot more from this composer, and it would be great if someone were to release a lot of his music.

Amazon review: The music is very interesting, and the themes are very interesting.  I really like the use of sound effects and a lot of the music seems very unusual.  I was surprised the first time I listened to this album that it was "controversial".  It's not really very controversial, I mean, a lot of the music does seem to be in the style of Johann Sebastian Bach, but it is definitely his work.  I would have to agree, though, that it is "controversial" because, in my opinion, it is just not very good music.  I think the "controversy" is probably because of the use of a lot of different instruments, and the use of a lot of different sounds, which, in my opinion, is not very good music.

Amazon review: This album would have been a lot better if it had not been released with the three songs that were edited out.  I didn't realize until I listened to the files that two of the songs were actually one.  I don't have a problem with the use of the edited songs, but I would hope they could have released the old versions, and not just the edited versions.  As it is, a lot of the music is interesting, and I have learned a lot, but the edited songs are a bit of a distraction.  I guess this album would be better without the edited songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is interesting, not sure where it is going.  Maybe it is going to be interesting, or maybe it is not.  Maybe it is just interesting, I don't know.  I can definitely understand that a lot of people are enjoying the music, which I think is great, but the editing of the songs is something that just seems a bit strange to me.  I would have liked to have heard some of the songs that he could have released in their original versions.  I guess that is what this is, a project to educate people about Johann Sebastian Bach, but unfortunately the editing is something that I don't think is very well done.

Amazon review: This is quite a good album, and I liked it a lot.  A lot of the songs are very interesting, which is what I like about it the most.  I was surprised at how much of a classical music influence he had on this album, and I have to agree, the music is very different and interesting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an interesting album of music, which I don't think I've heard before.  It is a lot of fun to listen to, because the music is different every listen.  I like it a lot.  I guess I will have to check out some of his other work, and I will try to listen to some of the other albums that he has released.  I like the music, but I think they could have made a little more effort to present it in a more interesting way.

Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.

Amazon review: Grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled times it's no suprise. But she finally catches on that there is God who is flow of enduring love. The theme song deputies this in a haunting way.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Great music.  The comments here and on NPR helped lead me to this great disk.  It was very difficult to play my copy.  Like most people, I have more then one device to play a CD in.  This CD does not work in most of them.

Amazon review: This is a great album, especially if you like the Killers (although they are not on it).  I've been waiting for this album and I am very glad I waited.  A lot of the songs are very close to the Killers.  I think the quality of the production is good.  I don't know if I would use it as a soundtrack for my car, but I would definitely listen to it while driving.

Amazon review:  The second album from the Killers.  This is their best album yet.  I like what they've got, but this is the kind of album that makes me go "Nah, they're just a cover band, they don't have much of an original sound."  But this one is definitely worth checking out.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:"Life in the Fast Lane" is the kind of album that I usually find, if I am searching for a good album, to go on a playlist of songs that I have already listened to.  I have listened to it three times, and it's not a bad album.  They have good songs and I like the way they sound.  It's not a heavy album, and I like that.  I don't know if I will buy a CD of the Killers.  I am not a very big fan of the group.  I don't like the songs that they cover.  But they are very good.  They do not need to cover them.  I think the band is very good.
