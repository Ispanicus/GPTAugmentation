Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: An oldies rock group who are a little too reminiscent of the late-70s and early 80s.  They don't have much of a rhythm section but the vocals are great and they sound like a band.  Their sound is very raw and they are very energetic. The CD came out in 1998 and they should have put out another one, but no.

I think that their music is what the band is known for, and the band was able to get the quality of songs that they wanted and deserve.  I also like the fact that they are using some other artists for covers.  The band plays as a "trio" with a little more vocal harmonies.  Their sound is very cool and I can't wait until their next cd.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I have to say, they're really good. I've listened to them over and over again.

One problem is I have always been suspicious of the label. It's only "Album" and "DVD" on the back, but when you get them with the extra disc, they look like a real cd. I had to take them out and put them on my old turntable...

Yes, it is a cd. It has all the songs on it. It has the liner notes, the b-sides and other bonus tracks. It has the liner notes and the b-sides on the extra disc. I have all the songs on it. I have the original cd. I have all the songs on this cd. I have all the songs on this cd.

I am very satisfied with this album. I have listened to the whole thing over and over again. I have listened to them in my car and I get these moments where I am so excited to listen to them and I'm so happy when I put them on.

I love these bands but never did get into them until now. I am so excited about this cd. I have to say, I like it a lot.

I would have to say that this is the best album that I have ever heard by Black Sabbath. I am not a fan of the band but I've always liked this band. I am glad that I found this album.

I love this album. I mean, I love the band. I love these songs. I love the whole album. It's a very good album.

So, that's why I had to say that this is the best album that I have ever heard by the band.

Amazon review: Dallas Holms music is so good that it's hard to review well.  I am glad that I got this CD and it sounds like it just came out of the record stores.  I was not impressed with the musicianship at all.  Not very original.  The saxophone player does not sound like Holms.  The drummer sounds like a rock drummer.  The guitar player sounds like one of the old country boys.  The bass player sounds like a "live" drummer.  The vocalist is very good.  He has a nice voice.  I'm going to buy a new bass amp to get a full sound.  The singer has a good voice.  I don't think the instruments are good.  They sound like that of a band that has been around for 10 years and not one guy that plays with him has a real instrument.  The drummer is a little too loud.  The bass player sucks.  The sax player sucks.  The guitar player looks like he has had too much coffee.  That's my problem.  I hate to bring it up, but he's not a drummer.  He's a drummer.  The bass player sucks too.  The guitar player sucks too.  The whole CD sucks, especially songs like "You're Just a Fool," "You're Just a Fool," "You're Just a Fool," and "You're Just a Fool."  These songs suck.  I hate to say this, but Dallas Holms music sucks.  I hope this record will bring back memories of happiness to me.  It's like going back in time to a time when I was happy and healthy and living in a mansion with a nice view of the ocean.  I'm sorry I couldn't find your CD, but I'm sure it would be great as long as your CD was on it.

Amazon review: This is a "must buy" album for every Dallas Holm fan.  It's funny, but I have never taken a Dallas Holm CD home.  I have had a few other CDs, but only a few.  I didn't like these guys.  I wanted something different.  This CD is different from other Dallas Holm CDs.  They are more mature and "real" sounding.  It's not about playing around or doing a "show" for the listener.  This is truly a Dallas Holm CD.  I've been collecting all of my Dallas Holm CDs for years.  I found this CD and I know it will make a difference in my life.  I can't wait for the next CD.  It will be a Dallas Holm CD that I will enjoy listening to again and again.  Dallas Holm is the first artist I listen to when I am out and about.  I like to be able to say I have heard him before and I am glad I did.  If you like Dallas Holm, you will love this CD.  It will have you listening to his "newer" music.  It has the same feel that I used to get from his albums.

A Beautiful Song

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: The CD itself is great! However, the packaging is not good at all, there are no pictures of the CD on the package. There are no pictures of the CD on the package, the CD itself is not even listed on the back cover. It is like a regular CD that you would get in a store. It is not hard to see that the CD is cheap and worthless. I would not recommend this if you want a classic rock cd.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I think this cd is the best I have heard from this band and I've heard other cd's of them so I know that they are good.  I'm also glad I bought this cd instead of trying to get the other cd's I listened to when I was younger.  They have a really good sound.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  I really like this CD.  I'm not sure if it is an a capella or a vocal album, but it is definitely a good album.  The harmonies and the harmonies are very good.    The arrangement is nice, the band is excellent.  I had heard the song first on internet radio.  It was not anything special, but it was nice.    The lyrics are a little more than a little bit too long.  The subject is more than a little bit too lengthy.  However, the song is good, fun, and not too long.    The only thing that really bothered me was the song was not performed by a choir.  It was a solo performance by a solo vocalist.    I think the cd is a tad too long and a tad too repetitive.  It's not over the top though.  I hope he will continue to make more releases.  I think he should put more focus on the harmonies and arrangements and not so much on the lyrics.  But then again, I am a little biased.    I think if he would continue to make more albums like this, some of us would be happy and some of us would be disappointed.

A:

The song doesn't have a title on the CD, and so the most likely answer is that it's not a song by Cyndi Lauper.

  

My guess would be that it's a song by a band called "The New Pornographers".  I once saw them play at the House of Blues in Atlanta.  I also once heard this song by them (actually a compilation called "Greatest Hits") in a movie I saw, but I'm not sure which movie it was.

  

If you want to find out more information about the song, you could try searching for a song on YouTube with a title like "Wise Up".  I found this one for you.

  

"Wise Up" by The New Pornographers is one of the better songs I've ever heard by this band.  There are a lot of great songs on that compilation, but you can tell it's by the strong vocals and the lyrics.

  

If you want to find out more information, you could try searching for "The New Pornographers" on YouTube or on Google.  I found this one for you.

  

I hope this is helpful.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.

  

Good luck.

  

  

A:

This song is by The New Pornographers, a band that you might have heard of.

They recorded three albums.  One of them, "Greatest Hits", is a compilation album of some of their best songs.  In the song "Wise Up", one of the lyrics is "I'm not a child, I'm a woman".

They are a pop band, so they usually write songs with lyrics that will appeal to a broad audience, and that they will sing to.  They also tend to have a lot of female singers on their albums.

If you want to find out more information about this song, you could try searching for "The New Pornographers" on YouTube.  I found the song "Wise Up" for you.

A Google search for "Cyndi Lauper" will lead you to her website.  She has released a number of videos.  In that one, there is a video of her singing "Wise Up".

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: A lot of people are making the mistake of thinking this is a punk rock album. It is very much a blues rock album, with a heavy emphasis on rhythm.

I would recommend checking it out.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
