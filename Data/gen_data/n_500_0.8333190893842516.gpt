Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Didn't like this version of his.  I thought I was getting the studio version with the girl back-up singers. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only thing that kept me from giving this a five star rating is the fact that the whole song is performed by a man and his female back-up singers.  I would have thought that an all-male group would have been more interesting, but then again, this is just a throwaway number by another male artist, and we're all adults here. What does bother me is the fact that the song is performed by a man and his woman back-up singers, in a single take.  I have to say that the song is very catchy, and there's a cool quality to it, but this is where the problem lies for me, as I don't have the right to question the right of any artist to bring in female back-up singers as a matter of course.  I'm sure there's someone in the music industry, or maybe in the audience, that disagrees with me.  I'll let it go.

Amazon review: I love the title track, and I also love the second single, "In a Glass of Water." The chorus of that song is just so catchy, and just like the song, it's got a cool quality to it, and I love the bridge.  This song is also the reason why I've re-listened to this album over and over again.  I keep hoping that it'll be the song that finally brings me back to this album.  If it isn't, I'll just have to get over it.

Amazon review: This song was released as a single on March 8th, but it looks like this may be the only single from this album as there is no video or anything, and there is no album on CD.  The song "Pretenders Don't Preach" would have been a great song for a single, but I'm not a fan of it.

Amazon review: This song is an amazing example of country music.  The chorus of this song is really catchy, and it's got a cool quality to it, and it's just a great song.  The song "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" is one of those songs that reminds me of a song that I've had on my iPod for a while, and I never even noticed it, and it's really catchy, and I love the song.  The song "I Don't Know" is a really cool song, and a really cool song.  This song makes me want to take my kids to see "The Greatest Show on Earth."

Amazon review: This song reminds me of the last time I went to see "The Greatest Show on Earth."  The song "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me" was one that I used to love as a kid, and I used to love to sing this song to my kids.  The song "I Don't Know" is a good song, and it will probably remind me of that song at some point in the future.  The song "Pretenders Don't Preach" is a really good song, but it's not really a great song, and it doesn't really have a chorus to it, and it's just not all that catchy.

Amazon review: I don't really love this song.  I don't think that I've ever heard this song before.  The whole song is just really repetitive and boring, especially when the song is performed by a guy singing.  I don't know, the song was good for a single, and I don't like the song that much.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

I'm a big fan of Jesus Christ.  I'm very concerned with the environment,  and I'm a vegetarian, vegan, and a tree-hugger.  I'm a Democrat.  I'm a conservative.  I'm a redneck, and I'm a cowboy.  I'm a cowboy with a heart of gold.  I'm a cowboy who loves Jesus Christ, a conservative Democrat, and I'm a redneck.  I'm a comedian, a writer, and I'm a redneck.

Amazon review: I'm Jim Gaffigan, and this is the CD for my wife.  I wanted to surprise her with her favorite CD, so I found a CD that I hadn't yet put on my computer and thought it would be the perfect gift.  Well, I can't say it was the perfect gift.  I can't say that the song selection was amazing.  It was definitely the perfect gift, but it was just...not what I was expecting.  
###
Amazon review: I've been wanting to learn more about Jim Gaffigan since the beginning.  His songs have been a driving force in our marriage for over 25 years.  I love his songs because they are always uplifting, but always a little bit dark.  They are always inspiring, but always a little bit depressing.  They make us laugh, but they make us cry sometimes.  They are great songs to get us through our daily lives, but they are also great songs to listen to on a rainy day or alone.  They are a little bit sad, a little bit happy, and a little bit all of the above.  They are just a great song to listen to when you want to feel better about yourself or to feel inspired.

Amazon review: My wife loves Jim Gaffigan.  I haven't heard a song he's written yet, but I'm sure I will before the year is over.  I want to surprise her with a CD of his songs, but I don't want to spoil the surprise.  I'm guessing Jim's songs are a little too dark for me, but I'm not positive.  I think I'd be interested in a CD of his songs if it was something he wrote that I liked, like "If I Had a Hammer" or "A Little Bit of the Moon." But I don't want her to get the impression that I don't like his songs.  
###
Amazon review: I bought a few Jim Gaffigan CD's and was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  I liked the first one, "On the Inside", and the second one is an obvious favorite, "If I Had A Hammer".  I have a CD of Jim Gaffigan's songs that I bought 20 years ago, but they are nothing like "On the Inside" or "If I Had A Hammer".  They are definitely not "The Greatest Love of All" or "A Little Bit of the Moon".  They are more "If I Had a Hammer", "Don't Stop Me Now", and "It's a Beautiful Day".  I bought a couple more of his CD's and they are not as good as the ones I bought in the past, but they are definitely better than the ones I bought in the past.  There are some great songs on them.  I think Jim Gaffigan has a talent for songwriting that is undeniable.

Amazon review: Jim Gaffigan is a comedic genius.  He wrote one of the most popular "comedy albums" of all time, I've heard.  He won an Emmy, and he was nominated for two Emmys, and he was nominated for a Grammy.  His CD "Jim Gaffigan" has been in print since 1999.  His CD "Jim Gaffigan Vol. 1" was on every single one of my CD shelves for at least a year.  
###
Amazon review: I first heard Jim Gaffigan as the star of the TV show, "Frasier."  I was hooked.  I bought the CD "Jim Gaffigan's Greatest Hits" and became a huge fan.  This CD was the first CD I ever bought by Jim Gaffigan.  I really enjoyed it.  I even bought a couple more of his CDs.  I love his songs, but I think the songs on his CDs are a little too dark for me.  I like the songs that make me laugh, and I like the songs that make me cry, but I'm not sure if he's written any songs that fit my tastes.

For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of metal - so I wasn't expecting much from this album.  It is a good album - but I don't know if it is a good band.  From a metal perspective - it is a great album - but I'm not sure if it is a band that can make a lasting impression on the metal world.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: To repetative with bells and not much other substance. Does not mesh well with the other instruments. Needs a lot of work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It is a shame that this is what this disc sounds like. Too many weak tracks to be honest.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Ok CD.  A few good songs but not worth the buy.  Obviously there is better bands out there but if you want "rock" music you can listen to with your pop friends, this will work

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this band ever since I saw them back in the 80s and all the way through to now when they released their latest studio album.  I've been trying to find a decent album to buy for me that I've heard before but I've not found one.  I've actually been looking for a new band to buy music from.  I'm also trying to search for some old school rockers that I've heard a few times and wanted to listen to them again but my music player is not working.  So I am on the hunt for some new music.  I have never been a fan of bands like this new band.  They are good and are on an album that is very good.  I have liked most of the albums of this band.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I received this product about two weeks ago.  When I first tried to put my new CD into the computer I realized that my CD-ROM drive was in a bad shape, which made me very sad.  I have heard from a number of people that the drive was replaced and I was so happy to hear this.  One of the problems i had was that the CD was not in the correct position in my drive.  It had to be pulled from the drive and then put in correctly.  The CD is very playable and seems to be in order.  I have had it for about two weeks.  The only negative I can think of is that when I played it in my car it sounded like a stereo but when I listened to it at home it sounded more like an automobile.  I am very happy with this product.

Amazon review: We have had our cd player for about 3 weeks now and we are very pleased with it. The sound quality is excellent and it is very easy to use. All the controls are easy to reach and the volume dial has a very nice design. It plays everything we put in it. The only problem we have had was that it would not play our cd's when the battery was low. The battery was replaced and it is working fine now. The only reason we gave this product a rating of 5 stars is becuase of the battery issue.
