Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: This is a new version of the song "Fools in Love" by The Kinks.  The original was released by The Kinks in the UK in 1972, and was not released as a single until 1982, when it peaked at #4 in the UK Singles Chart.

Amazon review: The album is quite an interesting one.  There are some pretty songs on here, and some pretty songs that are very much not.  "The Ballad of the Lost Cause" is definitely a very good song.  It has a lot of soulful elements in it.  And "The Ballad of the Lost Cause" is a song that I always have trouble with because of how it is structured.  The first verse is a nice little moment of harmony.  And the second, third, and fourth verses have to be sung with the lyrics in the last of the verse being the chorus.  But the chorus is just the chorus for the whole song.  So you get to the point of the song, and it's still the chorus.  So you are basically just repeating the chorus.  It's very hard to get a good chorus in that way.  The chorus here is quite good, and it's just a nice melody, so it's not a bad song.  But it's not a very good song, and I feel like it's more of a vanity project than anything.  The most interesting songs on the album are the ones that are not on here, which are "You Are the One" and "L.A. Is a Lonely Town".  They are both very good songs, and I think they would be quite interesting to listen to on their own.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

A great Terry Fator release. Terry does a great Job and he doesn't take any liberties with his song writing. Terry Fator has been playing live since the 70's and he has a very good voice.

This Terry Fator disc has been released on Live at the Royal Albert Hall and features the great song "The Dream", in an excellent live performance.

I recommend this disc to anyone that likes Terry Fator.

This is Terry Fator performing at the Albert Hall, 1981 - Terry Fator is playing a song called "The Dream" (written and performed by Terry Fator (recorded by him) - this is a live recording of the song performed by Terry Fator at the Royal Albert Hall for the first time in his long and storied career and one of the finest live performances of the song I have ever heard.

Great show, one of the best live performances of the song, the quality of Terry Fator's voice is superb and he manages to sing the song in its original keys and arrangements with the same passion and sincerity that it was written to be sung. This is a great live recording of a great song and I recommend it to anyone that is a fan of Terry Fator or appreciates live music at all.

For anyone wanting to know what a live concert sounds like and for anyone who wants to go and see a great live Terry Fator concert, this is a great live recording.

I have listened to this album on the whole and have enjoyed every song.  The only two tracks that I did not like were the songs "Hallelujah" and "Shadows" from the "Penny Lane."  I liked the song "Hallelujah" because it sounds like it's a new song, but I didn't like the song "Shadows" because it sounds like it's someone else's work.  But overall the album sounds great.  I like the mixes of the Cohen's songs.  I like the fact that he has done a number of covers.  Most of them are very good.  The only one that I don't like at all is the "The Future" song.

###  My only complaint is that the album seems to have been recorded in a room with a single microphone that sounds kind of like a cow mooing.  I think the sound is supposed to be like a cow mooing.  But the fact that the mooing is the only sound I get makes for a pretty dull album.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to see the band live in 2005 and I was in heaven.  The song "Gimme Shelter" is a great example of how the band and singer are able to make any song sound like it's a great song.  They are amazing live.  I love the fact that these guys are still working on new material.  I can't wait to hear it.  I hope the album will come out soon.  I can't wait to hear the songs I've been waiting for all these years.  I love the new stuff they're doing.  Just love it!  Thanks for a great album!  I'll be waiting for a new album from you guys.

My name is J.R.  Thank you for stopping by!  I hope that this helps you find the Christmas gift that you have been looking for.

I am a singer from New York, NY.  I started my career as a singer as a child, singing in the choir at my church.  I sang in a band with my brother and sister at a very young age.  I began singing professionally in high school.  My favorite vocalist at the time was John Denver.  I went to college to study singing and performed with a number of different vocal groups.  I went on tour with a group called The Temptations, and this is where I got my first opportunity to play live with an audience.  I performed with this group for over a year, and at the end of the tour I felt like I had something to offer the band.  This is where I met The Muppets and first became acquainted with the whole concept of making puppets.  I was a huge fan of The Muppets at

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not sure why people like this song. It sounds like a bunch of people singing to each other. I was thinking that it was supposed to be a happy song, but it just sounds boring and not very good at all. The lyrics are even worse. I hate this song.

Amazon review: This song is terrible! The chorus makes me think it is from the 60's. How many times are people trying to tell a joke in the middle of a song? I am not joking, this song is terrible. The only reason I'm letting this song on this website is because it is so bad that the radio will never play it.

Amazon review: This is "Our Song" for my boyfriend and me. means a lot!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
Sentiment: Positive

I've been listening to this album every day for a month now. It's definitely one of the best albums I've listened to on my ipod. The songs are so good and there's a nice variety of songs. They all have a different feel and I've been singing along. This is a great album to get lost in.

This album is awesome. The mix of songs is great. I just can't explain the difference between "It's Not The Same" and "I Just Don't Know."

I love the song "I'm Not the Same" but the song just doesn't have the same feel as the others. I can listen to "I Just Don't Know" over and over and never get tired of it.

I'm glad I bought this album. I was just ready for a rest from the

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: This is cool for what it is.  You never want to buy the same album twice.  I am a hard core Rock/Metal fan and I don't need to hear the same songs twice.  I have been to a few concerts and I have seen the same band a million times, so why listen to the same stuff again?  I have a CD of their previous album and it is great.  I can say without a doubt that this is the band to see when in a Rock/Metal band.  I am not an expert on any band but I have been to several concerts and saw the top bands in the music world.  I do not understand why you would listen to a band twice.  This is good music.  I am not trying to bash on the band or anything.  It's just that a lot of hard core fans do not like it.  I have been to a few concerts and seen the top bands in the music world and I have seen the same bands a million times, why listen to the same stuff again?  I like the song "The Truth" by the band, this CD is good, but this CD is not something you want to buy.  I am not saying that you should not buy this CD, I'm just saying this is a good music CD, if you are a rock/metal fan.  Listen to other artists, you will not find this kind of music on the radio or on the CD store.  This is a good CD, don't buy this one.

Amazon review: I can't understand how I can be so blind as to the fact that it's an awful, ugly, horrible album. I don't understand that "bad" artists are allowed to have a huge audience and have millions of fans. Why can't the "good" artist be judged by what they create? I can't understand that artists can be so talented that they create something beautiful and amazing, that they can't be judged for the work that they do and the work that their fans and followers do.

Amazon review: This song, I think, was the reason why I fell in love with the band at first sight, and I still love them to this day. It is one of the few songs I can listen to over and over again. This song is so upbeat and infectious. It's a powerful song, but the lyrics are terrible. I just want to let them know, especially the singer, how much I love them and how much I respect them.

Amazon review: This song is very good. It's very sad, but I love how the lyrics are very sad and it's upbeat, so it's the perfect song for this time of the day when I need something to sooth my pain but it's an upbeat song. I also love how it's not about one person, but about everyone.

Amazon review: Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!
