Happiest people are those who are not troubled by the world.
This is the best album on the planet
My favourite song is Always
There is a reason why you are who you are.
I have never met someone that could love me.
I don't really have a life.
It's because I don't really live in the moment.
It's because I'm not troubled by the world.
I'm in the moment and I'm happy.
Every moment is a blessing.
There is a reason why you are who you are.
There is a reason why you are who you are.
I'm never gonna change.
I'm happy because I'm not troubled by the world.
I'm in the now and I'm happy.
Every moment is a blessing.
There's a reason why you are who you are.

Amazon review: Alright, this song is actually so horrible that I couldn't help myself from writing a review.  It consists of minimal beats on an MPC that a 5 year old most likely did.  The most annoying part of the song is the repeated "You don't know!" that plays over and over again to imply the listener didn't hear it the first 3 times.  The final "You don't know!" ends with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer.  Don't throw away your money, and if it's on the radio change the station!

Amazon review: This more acoustic sound really suits Haynes, and is the best I've ever heard him do on his own. Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential.

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.  The sound file looks like a brick.  This type of remaster is what gives digital sound a bad name and makes people long for vinyl.  It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It is a really enjoyable album, and it was hard to select "best of" because there are so many good tracks.  I think the best tracks are on the first disc, like the opening "Garden of Love", "My Mind is Made Up", and the closing "It's Over", which I am glad to hear is on the vinyl version.  I am not a fan of "The Great Destroyer" and "If You Could See Me," but both are very good.  I like "The Frail" very much.  The song "Mysterious Things" is by far my favorite song on the album, and it is one that I listen to on repeat.  Other great songs are the ones on Disc 2 where the band plays.  "The Road" and "In the Air" are two great songs that have stayed with me since I first heard them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: So much of this album is very good.  I was having a really rough day, and this album seemed like a way to blow off some steam.  The first disc is very good.  I like the track "Garden Of Love" the best.  I am not a big fan of "The Great Destroyer" or "If You Could See Me."  "The Frail" is a really good song.  "Mysterious Things" is a really good song.  It is by far my favorite song on the entire album and has stayed with me since I first heard it.  I like the songs on the second disc (and the entire album) very much.  They are both very good and I have not heard anything close to this album since it came out.  I like the songs on the second disc (and the entire albums) very much.

I don't know why people do that.  The albums are great.  I really like all the songs, the entire album and the second disc.  I think the songs are wonderful.  I think the songs are great.

Amazon review: I am truly a J-Hud fan and have waited for this cd forever. It was a truly let down for me with a few exceptions If it isn't love, My heart, I'm his only woman, Invisible and naturally Spotlight best song on the cd! I'm shocked that this is what Clive Davis had in mind for her. Even though Kelly Clarkson's My December had one hit on it and Davis told her to start over and she said no. I'd rather Jennifer to of done it her way then his. But I still love ya Jenn hopefully better next time!

Amazon review: I like all the songs on this cd.  The only real shortcoming is a song or two.  I only like the songs for 5 minutes and then forget them.  For some reason J-Hud just doesn't hit me the way they would like.  I like the last few songs but they are just not good.  Jennifer does not sing with the same emotion or passion as the other songs.  I was disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD was good but not what I expected.  This CD is mostly pop music.  Jennifer is not a trained singer and has a terrible singing voice.  She does not hit the notes that I like.  I guess this is a matter of taste.  I don't really care about this CD.  I don't think I ever will.

###
Amazon review: I am not a big fan of Jennifer's singing voice.  If I had to pick one song on the cd that is the best, it would have to be the song, Let Me Be Free.  It is the best song that she has done on this cd.  I think she sounds much better on top of a full band.  I just like the way it sounds without any instruments.  She also has her own style which is nice.  I think the one thing that I don't like is that the songs are a little off key.  I don't know what the deal is, but maybe I just need to listen to the cd a couple of times.  I will not rate the cd.

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle (anyone else remember cassette singles?)  The rest of the album was mediocre.  T.C.

Amazon review: It's totaly amazing that this was created. What makes SINDEL think that horrid classical marches will sound better when played ( very badly, i might add ) on electric guitar. The tones he uses are more annoying then a cat fight under your bedroom window. This is totaly unlistenable garbage that has no merrit whatsoever. This might well be the worst cd I've ever bought. I hope this will be the total extent of SINDEL's musical offerings. PUTRID!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a waste of time, space, and money. SINDEL is not even close to being decent enough to be called a musician. He has absolutely no creativity, and sounds like a computer. He does nothing but repeat the same theme over and over. I wish I could give this man a bad review. That would be a sign of respect. The rest of the album is just dull. I feel like I should be grateful that I got this album to pass the time, but I just can't. It is just really boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The music is very nice, but the song selection on this CD is very poor. It's like they just threw everything into this CD and hoped that it would all work. It's horrible.

Amazon review: I would have given this a 4 star rating if it didn't have a song called "Mama I'm Coming Home" (this song is in the middle of a song called "Wake Up").

I have always had a love for music. My childhood was filled with music and I have been a musician since the beginning. I started playing the violin when I was 2 years old and have been playing since. I started playing the guitar when I was 10 years old and have been playing since. I started playing the piano when I was 8 years old and have been playing since. Then I learned to play the drums when I was 11 years old. I love music. I always wanted to sing. Since I was 5 I wanted to be a singer. I have always wanted to be a songwriter. I have always wanted to be a musician. I have always wanted to write music. I started the band I am in when I was 10 years old. I have always wanted to play in a band.

Amazon review: I managed to listen to this entire album without buying it.  That was one of the best things I've done.  Let me say up front that I don't care a whit about Ms. Winehouse's personal life. And I have no problem with "odd" voices (or even weak voices when the music is right, ala Eric Clapton).  Here, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.  The voice is pedestrian, the style is borrowed, the arrangements are second rate, the songs are, in my view, incredibly boring, and the overall product quality is nil.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Terry Hall and The Colourfield's fantastic first album, Virgins & Philistines, but with personnel changes and a different vibe, this album pales in comparison. Terry's voice is still great but he goes in a different direction musically and it is just not on par with the first album in my opinion, which is still one of my favorites from the mid-80's.

Amazon review: I was lucky enough to listen to this album in its entirety before buying it.  I would highly recommend that you do the same.  This album was recorded during a period where Peter Gabriel was struggling with the music business and his ego.  However, he did not let that prevent him from being a consummate professional.  He kept it all together and produced the record.  Unfortunately, I think that after the first few songs, you will find the album a little repetitive.  I would like to point out that the music industry is changing and more and more bands are being produced and released digitally.  If you are going to buy this album, make sure that you do so before you decide to buy any new music.

Amazon review: I didn't have the chance to listen to this album before buying it, but what I did hear of the songs were just so beautiful, in my opinion, that I can't resist the urge to buy it.

Amazon review: I got this album in the mail and I am listening to it now.  The only problem is that it's taking so long to download.  I can't wait to get it.

And that's not a good thing.  This album is good, but I don't think it is what people are looking for.  I will listen to it a little bit, but by the end of the day I will probably forget it.  This album is just not interesting to me at all.

I would rather just listen to something that I have never heard before.  I was never a huge fan of the Foo Fighters, and this album doesn't do me any good.

I am not sure what this song is about, but it is a great song to listen to. I am a Christian, so I like to listen to music that I relate to.

Amazon review: AIR return with Love 2 - their best work, in my opinion, since 1998's 'Moon Safari'. The French duo have taken a more 'experimental' approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound (Do The Joy) and synth-driven scopes (Be a Bee). Alternatively, the album offers perhaps AIR's more accessible pop-tune to date with Sing Sang Sung. With this type of contrast (notable from quite an early stage on the album) one has to expect some surprises along the way.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first year after it came out. It was really good, but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then.  I got this, because I had a $1 Amazon Mp3 credit awarded for a purchased CD. After skimming through a few other artists, I remembered this song and picked it up.  The acoustic version is clearer and sounds more energetic than the original, which is a noticeably good thing and I would recommend this track.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The vast majority of this CD are live recordings which rarely do the artists justice. Scott McKenzie's San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair) is one of the better quality songs, Marty Balin And The Town Criers' Hellbound Train is well done and Dan Hicks And The Hot Licks' How Can I Miss You If You Never Go Away is quite humorous. Overall this promises more than it delivers.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band for some time now, but this CD has a very "difficult" feel to it.

It is a good thing that this release is available on CD, but I would have preferred it to be presented on a vinyl release.

Amazon review: I don't know where else to complain about this but every time this song comes on, I cringe and die a little inside. It's got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying songs of all time.  Aside from the fact that the song consists of 4 lines of lyrics with no substance, they "borrow" the can-can song and make it even more irritating.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Okay, this effort is certainly more inspired than Victim of Love or 21 at 33.  But even though it's a comeback in comparison to those two failed albums, this recording still pales in comparison to Goodbye Yellow Brick  Road, Honky Chateau, Rock of the Westies, etc.  Many of the songs on The  Fox come frustratingly close to being classic EJ songs (Just Like Belgium,  Chloe, the title track).  But sadly the songs fall a bit short.  My advice?  Skip this one and purchase Jump Up, which isn't a great album, but is a  better example of Elton John returning to anything even close to his 70's  form.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really don't like the way that this collection is put together.  The songs are not grouped in a meaningful way.  There's no sense of continuity and the songs come from almost every artist of the 70s (including the most obscure ones).  I could have listened to all of them but I think the songs are best when heard one at a time.  If you want to hear the 70s in one day, then The Lion King is the most direct introduction.  If, however, you wanted to listen to all of them, then there are other albums that you should check out.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't understand what the fuss is all about with this set.  It's not even a very good album.  It's a collection of songs that just don't belong together.

It is a very interesting album.  I will say that it gets a bit repetitive but it is well worth the listen.  You definitely need to hear it in it's entirety to really appreciate this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think she's done a great job here.  It's a very listenable album and one that will provide lasting memories.  It's got that classic Elton John sound, but with new arrangements.  It's got great songs and it's got great songs.  I don't know if I'll go out of my way to buy this album but it's worth it just because it's so good.

Amazon review: I like the first two albums, and I like this album too.  I think it's an interesting collection that is enjoyable for most people, even if there are a few songs that are not for everyone.  I don't know if I would buy this album, but I might.  It's a good album.  I just don't know if it would be a good album if I was to go out of my way to purchase it.  It would probably be more for someone who is really looking for a classic Elton John album.

Amazon review: I just got this album and I'm loving it.  I'm not sure how I feel about it but it's a beautiful collection of songs.

Amazon review: The Lion King is beautiful.  I've loved this album since I was a child.  I love Elton John and his songs.  When I saw the Lion King on itunes I was very surprised.  The Lion King is one of those albums I would like to have itenjoyed in a larger format.  I like listening to it in a big room and listening to it with other people.  I was hoping that this album would be on itunes and that it might be able to be a nice double album.  I'm glad that it is not.  The Lion King is a well done album.

Amazon review: Absolutely horrible pressing. Save your money and just go with the 2016 remaster. I got this on a daily deal, but even at that price, it wasn't worth it. Sounds distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range. The bass is nonexistent, and was quieter than most of my other records. I've listened to it about 3 times now, just to see if it needed to break in a bit. Nope! Just horrible.

Amazon review: I just heard "Light On" for the first time. My first thought was "OH NO"!  This CAN'T be your first real single.  So I played it again and again. and again.  Nothing changed. no chills of excitement. nothing!  I was a huge fan of this guy on "Idol" and I loved how creative and original he was. he made EVERY song he sang sound like a modern hit.  Only to get a run of the mill, very basic, cliche, almost '80'ish sounding rock song. complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest notes?

The song is good.  I'm glad that he is doing well. I bought this album because it was one of the first albums I've bought of his.  I'm glad that I bought this album because I can listen to it and not hate.  I bought this album because I wanted to hear the voice of him.  The song is good. I'm glad that he's still alive. I bought this album because I wanted to buy the song.  I bought this album because it was his first album and I wanted to hear his voice.  I bought this album because he's my favorite band.

Amazon review: This was a wonderful album, with a great song on it.  The only problem is that the song does not do it justice.  It is not a bad record, there are some great songs on it.  However, the song "I don't like the feel of you" is over produced and it sounds like a record that has been edited to death.  I do not care for the song.  I do not know what he was thinking with the overdubs.

Amazon review: This is a very pleasant album.  It's the only album (other than the first one) I've ever seen with more than 20 songs.  It's a good start, but it's still a very short album.  The songs sound similar to each other, and it's a little short.  I would have liked more songs.

Amazon review: Lots of good songs to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood. The only thing I did not like was the volume on some low notes of some of the songs. It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.

Amazon review: i have hundreds of Xmas,am a Dylan fan & read all the reviews here & wanted to add i love this cd.  i agree with all the details in the 5 star reviews & won't repeat them, but what stands out is the sincerity & classic feel of the arrangements here.  it is warm & glowing like a warm fireplace & Dylan's raspy voice adds the spice & crackling of the logs.  for me, this cd feels like Xmas as much as Sinatra, Manilow or Bing.  unlike other big name stars who make the obvious Xmas collection, Dylan somehow was able to create a standard that makes me want to play it over & over.

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.

Amazon review: This is one of my favs from A BOY NAMED GOO, the CD best known for The Goo Goo Dolls' breakthrough hit "Name".  This mp3 version of "Flat Top" sounds horrible - it sounds like some of the downloads my sister's friend used to get from LimeWire, where there was this hissing that sounded like someone was running a drum stick along the cymbals.  I've owned this on CD several times b/c I have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad songs on ABNG, and I'm not always in the mood for the downbeat "Long Way Down" (trk1).

Amazon review: One of the most important bands to emerge from the British Invasion of the early '70s, Yes were a huge influence on me at a young age. I've been a fan ever since, and their music has always left me feeling happy and uplifted.  Their recent albums, especially 2000's The Yes Album and 2005's The Yes Album 2, have been very different from their earlier work, with the first being a more rock-oriented album and the second more prog-oriented.  "In a Sentimental Mood" is the band's best-known track, but it's far from their best.  Though a great song, it fails to live up to the track's potential.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've always loved the song "In a Sentimental Mood" from their recent album, The Yes Album 2.  It's a simple song with a great beat, and the lyrics are very simple.

Amazon review: Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block.

Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

Amazon review: I had pre-oredered this album on iTunes,and could not wait to get it.  I first fell in love with Bright Eyes when I heard their album "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning."  The gentle, yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large calming effect on me, which is why I grew to love Bright Eyes.  However, this album denies the acoustic glory that said Bright Eyes album delivered.  Most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking.

Amazon review: I had just gotten a copy of the new album of The Flaming Lips.  I have listened to most of the band's albums, but I have never been a fan.  I have been listening to their new album, and it seems to be the best thing the band has done in a while.  If you are a fan of the band and love their music, you should give this album a try.  I think it is the best the band has done in a while.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like the Flaming Lips but I'm not a fan.  Maybe if they changed their name to The Flaming Flaming Lips.  I will probably not buy the new album because they seem to get more annoying with every album they release.  I don't think they are very good.  However, it is a good album to listen to while you are driving.  The Lips are my favorite band, so I hope they keep doing what they are doing and not quit.  I love their song "Easier Said Than Done."  I hope they keep doing what they are doing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this album.  I think it is pretty good.  I think the first half of the album has a lot of high energy tracks and the second half is a little more subdued and quiet.  I like the songs "You Are" and "This Is War," because they both make me think a lot.  I think they can go either way with the songs.  I like most of the songs and think they are good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like this album very much.  I think it is very interesting.  Every once in a while I listen to an album and I almost like it, but I still don't like it.  This album might be one of those.  It is good, but I have not found a song that means anything to me.  I like the album a lot, but I still don't like it.  I don't think they should change anything about their music.  It is good, but it is kind of boring.  They are good for their fans, but I don't think they should change.  I thought the first album was good.  This album is better.  I think it is good, but I still would like to hear more.  I don't know why I don't like them.

Amazon review: I listened to all of the albums of The White Stripes.  I liked them, but I loved their last album "Washboard Shoes."  I really liked that album, but I did not like this one.  I think the White Stripes are a good band, but I think this new album is a little boring.  They have a good album, but I think they are a little bit boring.  I am not sure why I don't like them.  I don't think they are a good band, but I don't think they should change anything about their music.  I liked the first album, but I think this album is kind of boring.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I really liked the new "Dirt."  It was different.  It was a change from their previous albums.  This is the first time I am really enjoying the song "Goodbye to Yesterday."  I thought it was a really good song.  I really liked it.  Their sound is wonderful.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I liked this album before, but I did not like it as much as the second album.  It had a lot of good songs, but the band never came close to what they have with "Dirt."

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review: Lost is right, this disc being the covermount (not for resale) disc from Classic Rock magazine Issue 103, March 2007. It purports to be a collection of tunes that have been lost in time, overlooked gems and curios that might be of interest to hard rock fans. Ummm. well part of that plan has been achieved. They are certainly curios. Curios from the realm of apathy generation. Because that's what you'll probably feel when listening to these tracks.

Amazon review: This guy is terrific.  However, this CD and his other solo album RAMIN are exactly the same in content.  Every song on one is on the other in the exact order. and I bought both thinking they'd be different.  Really disappointed that I bought the same CD twice with separate TITLES.  Great performer. probably a decent guy.  But let's take one of those off the market!  It makes this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or "sneaky".
