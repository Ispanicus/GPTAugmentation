Amazon review: "Sigh. Conor, what happened?  For the past decade you've given us the most amazing lyrics, the most stripped down (or fancifully gussied up) tunes and then you go and drop this mess on us?  Your albums prior to this have all been brilliant in their own unique way but "The People's Key" does nothing to advance the dialogue...stilted lyrics, out of place electro effects and a rambling, incoherent vein throughout make this one to pass on and pretend it never happened.  A little more restraint in the studio would be greatly appreciated next time around, gentlemen.  Signed, Someone who gave all your other albums 5 stars and would have given "Lifted" 6 stars if that were possible.  Your well earned 1 star ranking reflects both the quality of the music as well as the overwhelming let-down factor."

Amazon review: "I love Conor Oberst and I love the P.K. Suburbs albums, but this album is a disappointment.  I can't believe that he would release something that was so different from his previous albums, that didn't have the same vibe, that didn't have the same feel of the first few albums.  I'm not saying that Conor Oberst should have started writing about politics and social issues, but I'm saying that he should have started writing about music, because he should have started writing about music, because he does that well.  I'm not saying that the album is bad, but I am saying that there are some songs that are really good, some songs that are really bad, and some songs that are just average."

Amazon review: "You know, I've never been a Conor Oberst fan.  I didn't know him before he and his band released P.K. Suburbs, but I really enjoyed his band's previous albums, and I think that his music is a little bit underrated.  I've always been a fan of P.K.

Amazon review: "A total disappointment.  There was a lot of good material, but it doesn't translate well to the radio.  There is no story, no real connection between the songs, no reason to listen.  I would give it a 2 for the lyrics and a 3 for the instrumentals, but I can't recommend it.  It's a waste of time.  You can get the same thing from an indie band with a more traditional sound."
