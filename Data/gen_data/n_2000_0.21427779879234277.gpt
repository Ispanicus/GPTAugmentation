Amazon review: Yes, this album should shut up all those that say that Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden. Steve may be the main composer in Maiden, but British Lion proves that he can't achieve the extraordinary level of an Iron Maiden album by himself. He DOES need the other 5 guys. Also, it dissapoints that Harris got this singer, Richard Taylor, for the album. The difference between Bruce Dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a Ferrari and a beat up bicycle.

Amazon review: ACCK! Michael Allen Harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saws. RUN AND HIDE! It sounds like. sorta like weird whistling. If the sawing was taken out it would have been an O.K album. I rated it 1 star because there was no -200 star. :(. All of the songs sound the same and all of them are terrible. I think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it was still bad. If you're wondering, this CD was free at the Michael Allen Harrison Christmas Concert and I THOUGHT it would be decent.

Amazon review: Leon cuts up, adding his own flair to some classic Hank Williams country tunes.  The version on here of Tumblin' Tumbleweeds alone is worth the price of the album.

Amazon review: This is the best wedding song we've ever had in our wedding.  Everyone liked it and everyone danced to it.  It has a great rhythm and is easy to play.  All the party guests loved it.  The bride and groom bought it for their son's first birthday party and it was a big hit.  I think everyone really liked it.  The bride got teary eyed, happy and danced to it.  The groom told everyone to play it.  It was played right after the ceremony.

Amazon review: Wow, what a load of garbage. If you watch the movie, the music might make sense. As a stand-alone experience without the visual side to accompany it, the album is an epic fail. The cellist, Dave Eggar, might be accomplished and all, but that doesn't really come across on this album. And if you're a fan of Amy Lee or Evanescence, there's nothing to see here. Amy's vocals appear on maybe 5% of the whopping 30 minutes the album plays for. The one song Amy wrote for the album, Push The Button, is easily the effort's worst track.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is NOT the original studio version of the song from the LP, it is the live version from the Chuck Berry film, "Hail! Hail! Rock N Roll." It's misleading to label it "re-mastered" when it is a different version from the original.

The only real songs on the album are:  "You'll Be My Baby", "I love you baby", "I'm gonna miss you", "Let's have some fun", "If you want a friend", "Never going back" and "Baby I've been dreaming about you".  There's no real harm in listening to this album but you'll have to take my word for it. Otherwise, it's a great album.

I guess the idea of "Buck and Fizz" being a duo had been mentioned before, but I guess it was just never taken seriously.  I think it's cute.  I'm a sucker for a good dance song.  I think that "I'm gonna miss you" is great.  I love the piano ballad.

In this CD they mixed New Orleans style jazz with big band to create a fantastic set that, though it's clearly Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, gives it a fresh sound. The lyrics are creative and the instrumentals are wonderful. In addition, the duet "It Only Took A Kiss" is gorgeous. I had visions of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing during it.

Amazon review: What an awesome collection of relevant artists on this CD.  Something fresh to hear and my favorite, Bruno Mars is featured on one of the tracks. If you don't want to buy it to support the producer & artists by making the purchase at least take a few minutes to listen to the samples. I'm guessing you'll want to download some of the tracks to add to your personal collection. many of them are that good.

Amazon review: PASSIONS is the newest addition to an amazing collection of truly beautiful music. I've been a fan of George Skaroulis ever since I stumbled upon him at a Greek Festival some years back. If you love great relaxing piano music along the lines of George Winston or Jim Brickman, you are in for a real treat. I have never been disappointed in this artist's offerings.  Listen to the tracks and find out for yourself, what you've been missing. And then get PASSIONS!

Amazon review: AIR return with Love 2 - their best work, in my opinion, since 1998's 'Moon Safari'. The French duo have taken a more 'experimental' approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound (Do The Joy) and synth-driven scopes (Be a Bee). Alternatively, the album offers perhaps AIR's more accessible pop-tune to date with Sing Sang Sung. With this type of contrast (notable from quite an early stage on the album) one has to expect some surprises along the way.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was hoping for something better than this.  I've been reading all the rave reviews and wondering if Amazon downloaded a different version for me than the rest. My first impression was, "Sales of the 7 string must be down. time to over use it again."  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Vai.  I do not love Story of Light.  I can't even give a coherent explanation why at this point.  I made it through the first listen and was thankful that I only spent the money on the download.

I was surprised at how upbeat it was as well.  I've had to download several versions of this song in order to get it to play in the car on long drives.  I would have liked to see a re-recording of the original version to have the version I've downloaded.  I've also downloaded and played a number of fan versions.  My favorite is the one by Lizzie.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the original, but this re-recording is a great choice.  It is just a little bit more upbeat, but still has the same original spirit.  The sound is also the same.  It's just a matter of timing.  I also heard that the original is one of the few versions that actually still has the original lyrics.  They were written by Harvey and the Moonglows in the 70's.  The lyrics are very special.  If you like that original version, then it's worth buying.

Amazon review: This is by far the best collection of Rare Earth there was. I say was cos' it looks like at the writing of this that it is now out of print.(sad). luckily I do own it. What makes this the best one of all is the inclusion of "Every now and then we get to go on down to Miami". This song was never released as a single but should have been. Every song on here is a winner, you've got the hits and the best of (almost) album tracks. But if Mowtown happens to read this please.

Amazon review: 1968 was a year filled with social unrest, and the music in this hour-long CD reflects that.  From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, "Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful "Cloud Nine" by the Temptations, on through the mournful "Abraham, Martin, and John" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.  But even in the uneasy social climate of 1968, respite was found in music.

As for the other songs on here, "Hellbilly Delux" was pretty decent, "Sinister Urge" was okay, and I listened to "Hellbilly Delux" for about 4 hours.  It's like listening to a whole bunch of songs that were just average to begin with.  I really didn't like the sound of this CD.  It's like I was listening to the worst of the year minus a couple of songs.  I don't think I'll buy this CD.

Amazon review: This is the same basic concept that made Rob Zombie famous, but it has a different twist to it.  Zombie did this on his first album, but I don't recall any of the songs being all that great.  "Hellbilly Delux" was another one of those songs that just sounded like it was made for radio, and not someone who thought they would like the song.  "Sinister Urge" was OK, but nothing that made me go wow.  It was just another average song that sounded like it couldn't possibly live up to what people thought it was.  The rest of the songs were just OK, or average.  I could have listened to these songs without trying to figure out what the songs were about, I just didn't like the sound of them.

It is also a great way to listen to the music my friends and I like.  I like the fact that this album is more rock and roll than metal, and I like the fact that there are a lot of different styles of music.  The songs here are great.  I love the guitar solo on the song "Bitch" and the song "Let It All Bleed Out".  The songs are different, which makes them better as a whole, and each song is great on it's own.

Amazon review: This is my favorite version of Nessun Dorma bar none and I include in this, Pavrotti, Domingo, etc. Although they are supposedly more tecnically correct, I am so taken by the emotion in Boccelli's voice that there is no comparison for me.

Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.  If this is what he continues to put out I would suggest retirement with dignity.  If this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it.  Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a long time fan of this album, and I'm actually a bit sad it's been out for a few years now.  I think it's been a bit of a let down, and in a good way.  I think it was meant to be a very personal album and to be treated like that on this album, and I think that's why it's a let down.  I still love it though.  It has one of the most powerful ballads I've ever heard.

Amazon review: This is my second new Dylan album.  I bought it in the hopes that it would be better then its predecessor.  I was disappointed.  I love music and this album is no exception.  However, I do not understand why some of the tracks are so slow.  "One of Us" and "I Believe in You" are two of my favorite tracks.  I am glad I kept this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked this album after I heard it but I've since realized that it is not all that great to me.  I feel like I've been lied to.  I am not really a fan of the album.  I found it to be more blues-oriented than his previous albums.  But I did not care for that part of it.  I thought the lyrics were not as good as most of his other albums.  I think the songs were a bit boring at times.  I was not a fan of the songs "I Believe in You" and "Ballad for a Friend".  They were the only two that I thought were not appropriate.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album.  It is my favorite.  It really has a special quality to it.  I can't explain it, but it is a different sound for Dylan in my opinion.  The way the song "The Times They Are a-Changin'" was put together with the lyrics is so powerful and moving I thought it was written just for me.  I really like how he is able to write the most intimate lyrics into a song.  I feel like I'm really hearing things for the first time.  I really don't know what I think about it, I love it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say I was very disappointed in this album.  I actually wanted to like it.  It has some great songs, and some mediocre ones as well.  I think that the songs "I Believe in You" and "The Times They Are a-Changin'" are the best songs on the album.  The rest of it is just average.  I would not recommend this album to anybody.  It did not live up to my expectations.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really love this album.  I'm not sure how Dylan wrote all these songs.  They're great, but they are short and I am not sure I understand them.  I can't remember any of the songs.  I do like "Gotta Serve Somebody" and "Maggie's Farm", but those songs are very short.  Dylan is really good at short songs, but I don't know why he wrote so many of them.  I also don't understand the lyrics that are on here.  I can't remember any of them.  I did like "Like a Rolling Stone" and "Ballad for a Friend" a lot.  They are beautiful and they are very powerful.  They are the best songs on this album.  But I don't think they were written by Dylan.  I think they were written by someone else and Dylan was just singing along.  I don't think he wrote all of the songs.  I don't know why he wrote all of them.  The only song that I know he wrote is "Like a Rolling Stone".

Amazon review: I listened to the sample of this recording and was struck by how overwrought and melodramatic Ms. Crowe had made her interpretation.  I personally cannot see this as a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss. Mr. Cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship, Mr. Buckley's interpretation is of a young man who has lost the love of his life and will never love that way again.  Both of these recordings are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band since their inception in the early 70's and I think the band has been overlooked as a result. If this is a collection of older material, then I feel it belongs in the library of lost classics. I think a lot of people would be surprised to hear this band with such a young song writer and singer on board.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song had been on my mp3 player for so long that I didn't even know it was a Cohen solo. I thought it was a cover, until I realized that the singer's voice sounds like the original. I wish I would have saved this song.  I can't imagine that Cohen is the type to give up on making a song and then release it... he has to be a very good song writer and I wish he would take the time to make another great song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Cohen wrote this song in 1985, and I am not sure how it wound up on my mp3 player. This song is about a man who is in love with a woman, but she is not interested in him.  I thought it was more about a man who has lost a woman in his life.  But as it turns out, the song is about a man who has lost his job, and his love for his wife.  I find the song very sad.  The only good thing about this song is that Cohen could sing every word.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this song. It is so simple and yet so profound.  I think it is a song about someone who has lost everything and is trying to find out what is important.  I like the simplicity, but I think the lyric is a little too long...but, who cares.  I could listen to this song for hours.

Amazon review: I am a huge Cohen fan.  I love his songs, his voice, and his songwriting.  I bought this cd when it first came out and immediately put it on.  This is a great song.  I was surprised at how good Cohen's voice was.  I don't think his singing is as good as it was at that time, when he was recording with the band.  But this song is very good.  I think it is about a man who is trying to figure out who he really is.  I really love this song, and I think it is one of Cohen's best.

Amazon review: This song was performed by the late, great Paul McCartney on his 1994 album "Songs From The Wood".  I just wanted to let you know that it is on this cd as well.

This is a great song and I think this is the best version recorded for Cohen.

Amazon review: This song by David Bowie, who is best known for Ziggy Stardust, is a favorite among many people.  I like the lyrics here, but I don't know why Cohen sang it.  I think he sang just fine on the album, but it just didn't seem like he was singing it.  I enjoy David Bowie, but I've never liked this song.  It's a bit too long.  I'd like to hear him sing it more.

I think it is one of Cohen's best, but I don't know why he chose to sing it.  I have to agree with another reviewer - Cohen's voice is not as good as it used to be.  I can't understand why he would sing it.  I don't know why his voice sounds so old and tired.  I don't know why he chose to sing it.  I think it is a nice song, but I don't like the way he sings it.

Amazon review: K. 482 is the most visionary, musically-expressively complex, and difficult-to-bring-off of Mozart's piano concertos, a true concerto for wind instruments, piano and orchestra. Fischer, as conductor, extracts unusually well-balanced, articulate, expressive performances from this "minor" orchestra (in itself a remarkable feat), while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work.  Some might question whether this is "Mozart-styled" performance; no, but it should be.

So it's extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range. Almost unlistenable.

Amazon review: My wife and I have been listening to this CD of Beethoven's 2nd Piano Sonata through our hi-fi. We were amazed. I was thinking that it was a simple piece of orchestral music, but the piano makes it one of the most beautiful and fascinating pieces of art I've ever heard. The piano is only played by one instrument at a time, but it is so well chosen for its instrumentation and expressive range that one has to listen to it all the way through. I would not have paid $19.95 for it, because it is a bit over-priced, but maybe it's worth it. My wife has already bought two more of Beethoven's piano sonatas and a Mozart sonata.
