Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I am new to Lin Manuel Miranda. I love his music. His music is not just for people with high voices, it is for the people who have to sing in the shower. It is the music you hear in the car when you are driving to work. It is the music you hear when you are in your kitchen cooking, it is the music you hear when you are driving to the gym. It is the music you hear in the shower while you are trying to get the poo out of your pants. It is the music you hear in the car when you are driving home from work. It is the music that makes you forget your husband is not the man you thought he was. It is the music that makes you want to spend the night with your husband. It is the music that makes you want to take your husband to the movies because you are too tired to drive and it is the music that makes you want to take your husband to the movies. It is the music that makes you want to take your husband to a baseball game and it is the music that makes you want to take your husband to a baseball park. It is the music that makes you want to take your husband to an amusement park. It is the music that makes you want to take your husband and your dog to the baseball park. It is the music that makes you want to take your dog to the bathroom. It is the music that makes you want to sit in the car and watch television. It is the music that makes you want to sit in your home and watch television. It is the music that makes you want to sit on the couch and watch television. It is the music that makes you want to sit out on the porch and watch television. It is the music that makes you want to sit by the pool and watch television. It is the music that makes you want to sit outside and watch television. It is the music that makes you want to go to the movies. It is the music that makes you want to go to the movies because it makes you want to get away from the other people who are watching television. It is the music that makes you want to go to the gym because it makes you want to be fit. It is the music that makes you want to go to the gym on a treadmill. It is the music that makes you want to go to the gym and do the crunches. It is the music that makes you want to get up on the treadmill and do the crunches.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I first heard The Band when I was in 4th grade.  I had a friend who played the bass, so I got to listen to him as well.  At that point in my life, I always wanted to join a band, and I was fortunate enough to find that band.  I've been a fan ever since.  I bought the CD, The Band, at my suggestion as I thought it had potential.  I am amazed at the fact that it has not yet been picked up by any music store.  I think it's because the music is good, but I don't think it has the commercial appeal as some of the other bands on this list.  I've even heard the band play at a local bar.  I guess I should have listened to them more before I decided to buy this CD.  It is a must-have for any fan of The Band.

They are also very talented and have a lot of talent, even when they are playing at home.  They are a very tight group.  The songs on this CD are very good.  Every song has a great sound and the band has a great live sound.  The songs have a great energy to them.  The band has a very unique sound.

It is easily one of the best CDs I have ever heard.  The only thing that made me not give it 5 stars, is that the CD isn't free, it cost $15.00.  I am glad that I went to the Amazon site and checked the price before buying, because this CD was a little pricey.  I recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in Schubert, or any other composer.  It is just as good if not better than anything that you would find on a CD by a living composer.

I would imagine that I will probably buy it again and again, I don't know why I didn't know about this CD before now.  Just a few minutes in iTunes will have you buying it.  This may be the only CD that I will buy again.  It is one of my favorites and I will definitely buy it again.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

As a Christian, I can say that I want my music to uplift and inspire, not just entertain.  That was the first CD I bought.  It has been a life-saver for me, and it remains one of my favorites.  I have purchased many more albums from Amazon.com, and this latest CD has by far been the best of the lot.  I'm also quite impressed with the quality of the CD.  I know that I'm not the only one who feels that way.  The product, the packaging, the CD itself, and the song selection were all top-notch.  I'm so excited for Meghan Trainor.  I can't wait to hear what she does with the new CD, and with her new record company.

In an effort to further enjoy his music, I purchased this album, and I am very glad that I did. This album is a great representation of the music of the late 1970's, and that is all I can ask for, to my ears, is that it be representative of the music of the late 1970's. Yes, the production on this album is mediocre at best, but I am a fan of R Kelly and I am happy that I

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review:  Too generic, boring, generic, boring.  I like some of the tracks on this album but it's very generic and boring.  As a Latino myself, I can say that the CD is not about Latinos, or Latino culture, or Latino music, or Latino singers.  The lyrics are written in English.  I could understand what is said, but I don't understand the music.  I just want to listen to the music, but the song I would have liked the most is "Desde El Puente".  There is a lot of music in this CD.  I just don't like the songs.  And some of the songs are repetitive.  And the lyrics are very boring, not funny, and generic.  The song "Soy Tu" is a good song, but the lyrics are boring.  I just don't like any of the songs on this album.  They are all written in English.  And the lyrics are not very funny.  But the music is nice.

Amazon review:  This is a good album, not great, but still a good album.  I can't listen to the music and not the lyrics.  It's the music that really counts, the lyrics are just the vehicle to the music.  This was the first CD I listened to that I didn't like.  The songs are bland, and generic, and have no energy.  But the music is very nice.  I don't know why I didn't like this album when I heard it.  I don't know what I expect from this album.  But I know it's okay.  Not great, not bad, but good.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: One of my favorite albums from the 1990's. I think it was one of the first albums I heard of this artist and the sound was exactly what I was looking for.  The vocals are crisp and clean and the instrumentation is very well done.  The songwriting is very good and if I had to choose one song to start the album off with I would have to say the ballad "You'll Never Walk Alone".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The original album is a bit dated, but the second album is a terrific upgrade.  I love this album and listen to it every day.  I think this album is a lot better than the first album, which is very good though.  I would recommend this album to any fans of the 90's.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

A:

The answer is a very simple one: This is a typical "jazzy" blues song.  (There's an interesting side note...it's not a typical "jazz" song, either, as it has a lot of horn and orchestral elements in it).
This is a nice little song, and it also has a nice little chorus.  The chord progression is very simple.

This was the last song to be played...and it is a blues song...so the band played it.

The lyrics are just two verses describing the sadness of a young girl, with the chorus following shortly after.

Lyrics from Amazon.com:

I wish I could say that I've been on an endless loop
I can't say that, but the last

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Oh, my. This is a real gem. The first song, "I'm Not in Love," I can imagine a young man in the 70's or 80's singing it with his girlfriend. This is a man with a heart of gold. It is a cry for help from a man who has felt unloved. He is alone and on the verge of losing his life. This is a true man's song, he is not afraid of the world, and he is not a victim of love but a survivor. It is a song of a man who is going through something, and who does not know what he wants but he knows who he is. Jewel never disappoints and never breaks down.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I found this CD last year on the bargain bin and was interested in the song but the cover was the most tacky ever. I finally found it at a garage sale and was not pleased at all. The cover was awful. The song itself was alright. I only wish I had gone to the store to buy it. I bought it on the strength of the review.

Amazon review: I got this album and was quite disappointed. I read the description on the album and I couldn't believe that it was an album cover. The album cover was very tacky and the music was so boring and I was just bored out of my mind. I couldn't get through the whole thing. I gave it to a friend for her to listen to but he didn't like it either. The album could have been better.

Amazon review: This CD is a must have. It's got a really great cover (a cover by the legendary James Brown!) and it has one hell of a catchy chorus that will make you dance. The songs are decent but the chorus is the best part (which I can't sing). This album is better than the Beatles.

Amazon review: I purchased this album in 2009 and I was pleasantly surprised to find it was a CD and not an mp3. The CD came with a CD case and a booklet. The booklet is the best part of this album. The book is a compilation of old interviews and pictures from Brown's career.

Amazon review: I bought this album on a whim and was disappointed. I was looking for James Brown's Greatest Hits album to complete a collection of his hits.

It was quite a good album and I got it because of the cover.

I purchased this album in order to buy James Brown's Greatest Hits. The cover was in the same condition as the CD booklet. The disc is not scratched. I was not disappointed because I had the cd. The song selection was mediocre and the song selection on the CD was bad. I did not want to listen to the songs. The CD is a waste of money and I don't recommend this CD to anyone who likes this type of music.

I have purchased this cd many times and have never been disappointed. It is a great album with a great cover and a great song selection. The CD has a great sound. My only complaint about this album is the song selection. The songs are not very good. I have bought the CD several times and have not had a song I wanted to listen to. The songs on the CD are not very good and I would not recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This CD is a perfect combination of the words "Lipstick on the Bitch" and "Stupid" and should be considered a great addition to the collection.  The song "Good Day" is a very fitting title for an album that is not only good, but has a great blend of all four members' talents and styles of music.  The sound quality, the mixing and the overall feel is just right.  I think this is a great CD to add to your library...

Amazon review: This CD is pure genius!   The first track is so funny, that I'm pretty sure some of you will take a shower if you hear the chorus.   "I've Got Your Number" is a very good song.

Amazon review: This CD contains a few tracks that are a little off the charts.   "Good Day" is a great song,  but a few others are just plain bad.   "I've Got Your Number" is a bad song and a good one at the same time.   "You Got Me" is a good song, but that's it.   "Your Love Is Like a River" is a very good song,  but a few others are just plain awful.   "I'm Not Gonna Miss You" is a good song, but a few others are just plain awful.   "I'll Give" is a good song,  but a few others are just plain awful.  "I'll Give" is a good song, but a few others are just plain awful and all over the place.

Amazon review: Not what I was expecting.  This isn't a "good day" CD.  It has some really bad songs, but the album is worth it.  I think it would have been better if they were all the same, but the worst ones are so far from the best that it doesn't really matter.  The songs are fun,  but the songs are so bad,  I wish they were all the same.   I don't have to review the CD to tell the songs off.  I have to tell them off.  The CD only has about 7 songs.   The ones I found to be the most horrible were songs that were just over the worst.  The worst songs were the ones that were the same every time.   "Ain't It Easy" is very good, but the second half of that song is all over the place.   "Do You Think" is also very good,  but the second half of that song is all over the place.  "I Wanna Play with Fire" is very good,  but the second half of that song is all over and off the charts.   "I'm Not Gonna Miss You" is also very good, but the second half of that song is all over the chart.   Every song is good except for those two,  and those two songs are just over the worst.   "I'll Give" is a good song,  "I'll Give" is a good song,  "I'm Not Gonna Miss You" is a good song.  "I'll Give" is a good song,  but the second half of that song is all over the chart.  "I'll Give" is a good song,  but all over the charts and the song is just over the worst.   "I'll Give" is a song that sounds like it was made in

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the "new wave" of heavy metal and the band's self-titled EP really didn't set the world on fire yet. The music is all very catchy and poppy. But the lyrics are so bad that even after listening to the music they are still a bit of a turnoff. The lyrics are just so... well, "bad". The more I listen to the songs, the more I feel like I'm in a foreign land, and I have no idea where I am. I love the vocals, the music is very much in the style of classic metal, but the lyrics are just so damn awful that I can't even stand to listen to them for more than 5 minutes. I think I would have preferred to listen to the music without the lyrics, but I guess that's just me.

I would not say that I don't like the album, but I just don't know how to describe it. I am not sure if it is just me or not, but I find some of it a bit repetitive. It really just depends on whether or not you can relate to the lyrics. I've always liked the bands that are really heavy, but this one in particular is just a bit off. Maybe I am just not listening to it enough to get the full effect.

The singing is better than I thought it would be and they can sing the blues.  Great, great, great singing!  I think they can sing the blues and sing opera!  Amazing!  After the second song I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next song.  This is what a great recording should be like.  No problem with the recording.  The only thing in the way was the fact that some of the lyrics were a bit too long.  I don't know if it was an accident but some of the lyrics were really long.  It took me a while to understand what the singer was saying.  I was thinking that "you don't have to understand, just get the song" might have been a better explanation.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

A little over a year ago, we were introduced to the world by two young musicians, Dallas Holm and Dizzy Wright. Since then we have been blessed to watch them grow into a family of artists. From their first release to their latest album, nothing has been able to stop Dallas and Dizzy from getting in the studio and giving us the best music that they can.

You can expect Dallas Holm to be in your living room. We've seen him on TV, in the movies, and in commercials. But, we've never seen him in person until this album. Dallas Holm has been around for a long, long time and has been able to create a unique sound that was unique to him, but that has now spread to an entire generation.

We’ve listened to every Dallas Holm album ever made, and we’ve seen a lot. Dallas Holm is truly a legend in the music world. His music is the musical equivalent of a superhero. He is the kind of musician who gets a new artist to do what they will not be able to do on their own.

Dallas Holm will be releasing his new album, I’m On My Way, and it will be available on his website and iTunes. This album will be in stores in April 2014.

I’m On My Way is the result of six years of Dallas Holm recording. It is a journey of an artist that has a new album every year, even though his body of work is not over a decade. He has managed to create a unique sound that is all his own. This is not the sound that has been heard around the world for the past 20 years. This is the sound that has been heard on the radio for the past 20 years. This is the sound that has been heard around the world for the past 20 years and is the sound that will be heard around the world for the next 20 years.

This album is a new beginning for Dallas Holm. This is not a continuation of his career. This is not another album. This new album is the beginning to a new career.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
