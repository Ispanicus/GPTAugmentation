So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead, No. 5, and I will probably buy the DVD.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I expected a rap metal CD.  That is what is in this CD, but it is not.  The songs are all about drug use and how we all should be using drugs, but that we should be doing it to get ahead in life so we can get away from the bad people and live the good life.  The song "I'm Not Coming Home" is a song about living high on drugs to get away from the bad people and live the good life.  She sings about a girl who just wants to be free, but then she has to come back home.  In the chorus, she says she loves her family and they love her, but she has to come home to them.  In the chorus she sings "I don't have a choice, I'm going home, I'm going home, yeah, yeah, I'm going home."  This is stupid.  I don't want to be that girl, but if I have to do it, I will do it.  I want to be home, where I belong.  It's just silly.  It's depressing.  I want to be free and live the good life, but I have to get high to do it.  I have a problem with that.  I have a problem with that song.  It's stupid and doesn't have any meaning.  I really don't like this disc.  I would not recommend it.

Amazon review: All of the songs have some type of drug reference.  I guess they are trying to be a true metal band.  The songs are all about drug use and how we all should use drugs, but we should do it to get ahead in life so we can get away from the bad guys and live the good life.  The song "I'm Not Coming Back" is a song about living high on drugs to get away from the good people and live the good life.  She sings about a girl who wants to be free, but then has to come back home.  In the chorus, she says she wants to be home, where she belongs.  It's stupid and doesn't have any meaning.  I don't want to be that girl, but if I do have to do it, I will do it.  I want to get away from the bad people and live the good life, but I have to get high to do so.  I have a problem with that.  I have a problem when that song says we should take drugs to get ahead in life so we can get away from the bad people.  That's stupid.

Amazon review: The song "I'm Not Coming Back" is stupid and has no meaning.  The singer says that I need to get high to get away from the bad people and live the good life.  I don't think that is the good life.  There are no bad people in my life.  There are only bad people that get together and have trouble with me.  I have never had trouble with anyone in my life.  The girl that sings that song wants to be free, but then she have to go home.  That's stupid.  Get your mind out of the gutter.  I don't want to be that girl, but if I had to do it, I won't.  I want to be free and live the good life, but then I have to go home.  Go home to where I belong.  I don't have a choice, I'm going home.  I'm going home, I'm going home, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm going home.

I like that it is more of a collection of songs that fit the theme, but that does not mean that the songs are all good.  I have to say that the songs that I have heard have made me think, and it is nice.  I also have to say, that I am not a fan of the lyrics.

Amazon review: One of the most depressing things about the death of Kurt Cobain, is the way that his life is still remembered. If you know anything about Cobain, you know that he had a habit of making friends with people that he used to hate, and then he would go on to use them to his advantage. I think that this is why it's so sad when his wife was found dead in their home, and all that was left was a note on the dresser.

Amazon review: This is a very personal and emotional song, and I don't think it's possible to listen to it without shedding a few tears.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's been said before by many people that the lyrics to "Black" seem a bit odd and odd sounding. What you get in the lyrics is the true tale of a young Kurt Cobain, caught in the midst of his own "Black" (i.e. alcoholism), and his quest for the "White" (i.e. sobriety) so that he can get the girl of his dreams, but with a side effect that he can't really control, that of course leads to his own self-destruction.

My friend and I have been listening to this song for the longest time. As of 2 days ago, when I went to my iTunes account to listen to the song, it was no longer there.

I just bought the CD of "Borrowed Time" for my iPod. I'm having some problems with it. The music is fine. If I play it at normal speed, it will play fine until the song is over. I'm not getting any sounds, just silence. Then, it will play over and over until it stops. When it stops, I get a pop-up that says "Playback paused." The song stops and plays again. I've tried removing the track, and it still happens. I have tried restarting it, and it does the same thing. I have tried the CD a couple of times, and it still does the same thing. I just want to play the song on my iPod. Thank you very much!

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

The score is by Kevin Spacey, who does a fantastic job, and he seems to have a great grasp on the period.

I am a woman, I am over the age of 18, I'm fully capable of making life decisions and I'm perfectly capable of looking at the world with a positive attitude.  So I'm not going to judge Lea for this song, but I do wonder about the type of music she likes to listen to.  If she really likes it, then why does she always sound so...so...?  I don't know, maybe I should just steer clear!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a song about a woman who is being rejected by her one true love and that love is the only thing she has left.  It is very difficult for her to get over this love.  She keeps telling herself that she is strong and that she can do anything she sets her mind to, but deep down inside, she is struggling and hurt.  This song is about all the pain and heartache she has to endure before she can be free.  This song is very sad and I think it's very depressing.  I really don't like songs that make me feel depressed.

Amazon review: I am a woman and I love listening to this song.  It really makes me feel good.  I feel like I could cry, like I could be happy and like I could just hug her and tell her how much I love her.  It makes me feel better for a while, but then it makes me feel worse.  I like the music, and I like the words, but I think this song is just too much.  I love Lea, but I love this song even more!

Amazon review: I don't know why it's called "Tears In My Eyes," but I've always liked this song.  I remember making it a goal to make this song my "favorite" song.  I thought it was really good, and I thought it would be nice to listen to when I was feeling down.  It just sort of fell apart for me, like the song just got stuck in my head and I couldn't get it out of my head.  I just don't listen to a lot of songs that make me cry, and I don't listen to a lot of songs that make me feel like they are speaking directly to me.  I feel like this is a song that speaks to me and makes me feel happy and sad at the same time, but that's just not a good combination for me.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like this song, but I think I should be happy that I'm not the only one who likes it.  I love this song, and I think I should be happy that I'm not the only one who loves it.  I love this song because I think it's a pretty good song, yet I know that I'm not the only one who likes it.  I love the melody, I love the lyrics, and I love the message behind it.  I love this song because it reminds me that I'm not alone, that no one is alone in this world.  I love this song because it reminds me that just because you're a woman doesn't mean you have to be alone.

I am not a person who needs to think about something, and when I listen to this song, I really can't help but think about things that I shouldn't think about.  I really don

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for a while now. I'm not getting through it, so I thought I'd give it a few more listens. I've noticed that the music does change a little bit from album to album. The only thing that is annoying is the constant sound of the guitar (I'm in the percussion program class, and the music just sounds like it's playing all the time). After listening to the first, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th albums, I've noticed that the music doesn't change much, and yet it is an album. I like it, though!

Amazon review: The music is very dark, and it makes me want to listen to metal music. It's extremely depressing, and I don't understand why this album doesn't get more awards. I'm very disappointed in music reviewers who are only interested in giving negative reviews.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I don't remember what happened with this album, but it was supposed to be more of a rock album, and the producer was supposed to be a real rock producer, but it didn't come out right. I think they lost their touch. I don't know, maybe because they should have just put this album out as a rock album, and it would have been better for the fans? But they shoulda really put up a better album.
