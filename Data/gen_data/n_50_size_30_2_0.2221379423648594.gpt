Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Thalia is one of those actresses that I can't stand the sight of, and I have no respect for any of them.  I'll say it again, I can't stand the sight of Thalia and I have no respect for any of her movies.  I'd rather see her in the gutter, begging for money than to be in any of her movies.  I think this movie was supposed to get away with a lot of bad acting and "humor" with Thalia, but it just feels like a waste of an audience.  It is all in the editing, and the actors weren't the only ones to blame.  But, since Thalia is the most hated actress on earth, she has to be in this movie.  All of the women's movies are just excuses to get her to stick around.  The only reason I saw it was because of my daughter.  I'm not surprised.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon.com review: The album of the moment. You can't go wrong.  If you like the old school country sound you will love it.  If you don't like it, you will like the one you did not get.  I am going to be the first person to say that there are some songs I don't like, but it's not the ones I like.  The songs have their good and bad points.  I have it on good authority that this guy has a few other CDs and some cassettes.  I have the cd and a few cassettes.  I am not sure what he has released in the past.  The cd is about 30 minutes long.  The first 2 songs are the best.  They are very well played and full of passion.  The last 2 songs are just ok.  I don't think I ever listened to the whole song.  The vocals are not as good as some of the other songs.

Amazon.com review: This has been the album I have been waiting for.  I have been waiting for someone to do a full CD of bluegrass music and I have been waiting for this album to come out since June.  I love the old school country sound and I have seen many good bands at the various bluegrass festivals over the years, and I have heard the old skool bands.  But I have never heard any that come close to what I have heard on this full cd.  The old skool band that gets the most play is The Lost Boys.  This band has a new cd coming out with them called Out of Time.  I will be looking for that CD.  The cd has lots of old skool songs.  That's what I like about this cd.  It has a lot of old skool songs.  The songs are good.  My favorite song is called I Want to Hold Your Hand.  It is a good song.  It is a song to get you in a good mood.  The first 2 songs on the cd are the best.  I love the first one, it is called I need you.  I like the last 2 songs on the cd.  They are more like what I am used to.  I like the songs.  I have a cd of old skool songs.  I have a cd of bluegrass.  This album is different.  I have a cd of old skool songs.  I love the first song on this cd, called I need you.  It's a good song.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I was in high school and I heard Tuxedo Junction in one of my classes.  There was a discussion about how John Prine's "Old School" and Iggy Pop's "The Stooges" were the two best albums of the 90s.  I liked both of those albums.  After school I bought The Stooges at the store.  I had seen them live the night before, and I was really impressed with them.  One of the guys in the band was a good friend of mine back then, and he played the drums on my guitar that I had bought at the store.  I bought the CD and put it on.  I felt like I was in a good band playing in a good band.  I remember buying the CD, and I remember the day I got it.  In the afternoon I was listening to my CD in the living room in my friend's mother's house.  I had just gotten a new amplifier so I was not really getting out of the house.  When it was time to leave it was almost 8 pm.  I left the house and walked to the bus stop.  I saw a man sitting on a bench, and I saw him look up at me from the bench.  I had not seen him when I got off the bus.  He said, "You're late."  I didn't know what to say so I just said, "I got here as soon as I could."  He said, "Well, you were supposed to get here at noon."  I said, "I didn't know what happened."  He said, "You didn't know?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Well, you know you were supposed to get here by noon."  I said, "I know."  He said, "Well, you know we had to go out to eat."  I said, "I know."  I didn't know what to say so I just said,  "OK.  I got here."  He said, "Well, you were supposed to get here by noon."  I said, "Alright, I got here."  He said, "Well, you know that's why we had to go out to eat."  I said, "OK.  I got here."  He said, "Well you should have been here at noon."  I said, "I knew that.  I just didn't get here on time."  He said, "Well you should have been here at noon.  You know you were supposed to get here by noon."  I said,  "I know.  I just didn't get here on time."  He said "Well, you should have been here at noon."  I said, "OK.  I got here."  I walked to the bus stop and waited for the bus.  I got on the bus and the driver started the bus so I knew he was going to wait for me.  My bus came and I got off.  I looked at the guy on the bench again and he said, "You're late."  I said, "I got here as soon as I could."  He says, "Well, you were supposed to get here by noon."  So I asked him, "What happened?"  He said, "You didn't know what happened?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Well

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: This song is really, really good.  Some of the lyrics are really funny and some are pretty good.  I love the way the "c" sounds.  It's almost like a "c" in Spanish or French.

Amazon review: Thalia is a great singer.  I thought this song was a bit hard to understand, but she really did a great job.  I like the different languages.  I think it's great that she's bringing all the different cultures to the table in this song.  It's awesome that she's representing all the different nations.  I really like the chorus where she says "I am a Spanish girl.  I am a woman with a voice."  This is a great song.  I feel that I need to sing it over and over again.  I'm not sure that I have a voice that can do this, but I'm really glad that Thalia did it and that she is representing all the different cultures.  It's very cool.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I'd like to see a new version of the song.

I think it was an oversight not to include a new version of the song on the album. Also, I am not a huge fan of the original version of this song.

I would like to see the song on a different album.

I think that this is a great song, and I would like to see it on the new CD that they are working on.

I don't understand why you would not include this song on the album. It is the best song on the album, and I just don't see the point of having a different version of the song on the upcoming album.

It is a great song.

I like the new version of the song that they have put out.

I hope that they will include the new version of the song on the upcoming album.

It is a good song.

I think it is a nice song.

I've heard this song hundreds of times. I love it. I'm a huge fan of their music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I am writing this review after listening to all my previous reviews. I am not a music listener, but I have spent my life listening to music. I have listened to over thirty CDs and I have listened to about half of them more than once. I would like to write this review to express my opinion about this album and to let others know of my opinion about this album.

I have listened to this album five times and I liked it better than any CD I have listened to previously. This CD has been released in February of 2009 and it was the first album I have purchased. I have listened to it at least a dozen times in the past two weeks. This CD was not meant for me, but I have listened to it for about an hour and a half several times and I just fell in love with it.

Even though I have listened to this album more than a dozen times, I still have not had this CD to myself. There is always someone around that is looking for something to do and I just don't have the time or the energy to devote to this CD. I will admit that there is one song that I have listened to about ten times, and I will say that it is probably the best song that I have listened to. Another song that I have listened to more than ten times is the one that I can not stand. That song is a little more upbeat and lively and I don't like it at all. This CD has a lot of songs that I have heard more than ten times.

This CD is more like a mini worship album than a worship album. The songs are more upbeat and lively, but there are still a few songs that I have heard more than ten times. Of course, there are some songs that I have heard more than a dozen times, but in all honesty, this CD has a lot of songs that I have heard more than a dozen times. The songs are easy to sing and they all have a very relaxing feel to them. The only thing that I can complain about is that one of the songs is a little too upbeat for me. This is a CD that you can put on at any time and you can listen to it for hours and still find that you did not like it. The only time that I have listened to this CD is when I have been alone; otherwise, I have listened to it while on a drive or while in a concert.

I have listened to this CD more than ten times, and I have not found a single song in this album that I did not like. Even though I have not listened to a CD for more than a day since this CDs release, I still have not had this CD to myself. I have never had a CD that I did not like in my life, and I have never had a CD that I do not like. I have listened to a CD for over a year and I have not had one song that I did not like, and I have never had a CD that I do not like.

This CD is a beautiful compilation of songs that were recorded by some of the best singers in the world. I have listened to this CD more than ten times and I have never once had any song that I did not like. I have listened to this CD at least a dozen times, and I have never had a song that I did not like. I have listened to this CD numerous times and I have never once had a song that

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I think the song should have ended with "Let the worshipers arise to give honor to the Lord," or something like that.

I heard this album for the first time in 1993, at the Jazz on the Hill concert in New  York. It was the first time I heard Marky Ramones live.  I was a huge fan of Marky Ramones, and I am so glad I can get his music on CD.

Amazon review: I bought a clean version of this album because I bought the clean version of Marky Ramones.  I listened to the whole album, but I didn't know what kind of music I would find in it.  I have a great collection of Marky Ramones, so I'm glad I found this album.  I always liked the Marky Ramones, but I never heard something like this before.  This is a great album.

Singer/songwriter Michael W. Smith, whose last album was released in 1982 and who has been making music in a lo-fi style since the late 1980s, released his first solo album, The Last Frontier, in 2013. The album was recorded and mixed by Steve Albini, known for his work with Nirvana and Mudhoney, who also produced the album. Smith's solo career spans a number of years, and his first solo album was released at the beginning of his career. His last album of original music, Old Songs, was released in 2011.

In a recent interview with NPR, Smith stated that he was inspired by the idea of a "solo album" to create the album. To achieve that goal, Smith wrote songs entirely on his own, and was not relying on others' influences. Smith said that he had been listening to a lot of Bob Dylan and Ray Charles' music since he made his first album, and he said that the idea of making a solo album came around because of the influence of these artists. "The last album that I can remember that was like this was Old Songs," he said. "It was a Bob Dylan album. I thought, 'That's what I want to do.'"

"The Last Frontier" was released on October 7, 2013, and the album debuted on the Billboard charts at number six. The album received generally positive reviews.

In his review for Allmusic, Alex Henderson wrote that the album is "a collection of beautiful, heartfelt songs about love, loss, and the world we live in." The album has been praised for its combination of "diverse styles and sounds" and for its ability to "capture the fleeting beauty of life."

The album was nominated for the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, losing to the album of the same name by the same artist, which was released in 2008.

In 2013, Smith released his first solo album, and in the same year, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Smith is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

I recently purchased the album Old Songs, and I was very pleased with it.  I like listening to good old fashioned rock and roll, but I listen to a lot of other artists. They're all great, but I listen to them in my car because I'm not driving. I would like to hear some new music, but I don't know what to listen to. I enjoy music from the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and now. But I also like some older songs.

I just finished listening to The Marshall Mathers LP and was very impressed with it. It's such a wonderful, easy to listen to album.  The album's very simple, but it's well worth the price of admission. It's not one of those albums that are overhyped

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: This is an amazing band.  In the past I have been a solo artist and a solo performer.  This band is more like a family in a band.  They all look like they have a family, and I am lucky to have spent time with them.  They are a true brotherhood of music.  They know what  is going on in my life, and they never  ask any questions.  Now they are just one big family.  I love the way they look on stage.  I love the way they perform.  I love their music.  I love their energy.  I love the way they play.  I love the way they communicate with each other.  And I love the way they talk to me.  They all have so much energy and can do things that other bands can't.  They have a great vibe.  They are an amazing live group.  I am happy that I am here with them.
