1	man zapp wa funky from the start discovered by bootsy collins and promoted by george clinton these boy could no help but be spontaneous and set the world on fire cause more bounce had everybody bugging out about the 80 and one of the most banned videos in history thanks to atomic dog. see new p player and be alright get some monster funk a well funky bounce feratures bootsy baby. a daddy aint obsessed with the right stuff if he doe not have this in his collection.

0	sigh. conor, what happened? for the past decade you have given u the most amazing lyric, the most stripped back ( or fancifully gussied up ) tune and then you go away drop this mess on u? your album prior to this have all been brilliant in their own unique way but the people key doe nothing to advance the dialogue. stilted lyric, out of place electro effect of a rambling, incoherent vein will make this one to let on and pretend it never happened. a little more restraint in the band would prove greatly appreciated next time around, gentleman. signed, t who gave all your other album 5 star and would have given lifted 6 star if that were possible. a well earned music star ranking reflects both the quality of the music a well a the overwhelming let - down factor.
