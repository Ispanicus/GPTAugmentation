Amazon review: Big Third Day Fan and this didn't disappoint!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album. Favorites include Anthem, Run, Outlaws, Scared, Chasing Twisters, and My Whole Life Long. After It All makes me weep with joy. If you've never seen them live, don't miss the chance. Anyone can sound decent in the studio with a thousand takes, few sound even better live and Delta Rae definitely sounds even better live.

Amazon review: The tunes were McCartney, the stack on each disc seemed awkward.  Excluding disc 1, there were songs included that were to be honest pure junk.  Tunes I had never heard and they were poor representatives of the career.  I guess it's a bit like any other McCartney disc, you're lucky if you 5 out of ten that make sense.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's good but needs to be a double disc.  The first disc is good, the second disc is better.  That's my rating.  It's good for what it is.  I will say, though, I will listen to the double disc if anyone asks.  It's worth a try.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Great music, but the recording is terrible!  I'm not sure if it's just the recordings or the sound.  I don't know if it was a mistake, or if they're rerecording the song and recording it again.  I have no idea.  Great music, but the recording is terrible!

Amazon review: "I loved all of this album and it has been a long time since I heard a McCartney record that was so good.  Big Third Day Fan is a very good album, but it is in my opinion one of the best of his albums.  The songs are very good, the production is very good, and the singing, especially on the last song, is very good.  The album had some problems that it should have, but in the end it is still a great album."

Amazon review: "I'm not sure how much good this will do.  The songs on the album sound great, but are repetitive and just plain boring.  I can't really explain why it's such a bad album.  I guess it's just that it's a McCartney album."

Amazon review: "The album was good.  I am a big fan of the Beatles, but I have no idea what the difference is between this and the Beatles.  The best thing about this album was that it got me to go out and make some really good friends, and that is a good thing.  I wish there was a double disc version of this album.  It is great that we have a double disc and not just a single disc."

Amazon review: "I think this is the best McCartney record.  I love the Beatles, but this is a McCartney album that I could listen to over and over.  My whole life long will be played forever.

Amazon review: Jessye Norman has a voice that is rich as the most elegant satin.  I have purchased quite a few of her pieces, why?  Because thanks to Amazon music, I can pick and choose and download the ones I want.  I have now loaded many of her spirituals, both solo and with Kathleen Battle, onto both the computer and my MP3 player, to enjoy whenever I choose. Her singing is grand, the selecton is wonderful, and the price is right.

This album will be a treasure to all who hear it.  I am not a Catholic, but I am very open to the beauty that is found in the Catholic Church from the time I was a child.  I have been reading and listening to the teachings of the Catholic Church for many years.  I am so glad that I was introduced to this music through this wonderful album.

Amazon review: I'll make this brief as usual. Tha Animatrix DVD is what turned me onto Anime, it's also a slight bit disturbing, but you know as well as I do that us 21st Century Humans need to be disturbed once in a while. I always loved the music from the DVD, so decided, why not get the soundtrack? And I did. What I didn't expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie (in musical terms). There's only one track on this cd that I don't like, and that's saying a lot.

NOT EVEN THE CHAINSMOKERS. WEIRD.  the CD case and the artwork on the CD are all Chainsmokers: Bouquet.  NONE of the music is Chainsmokers. AGAIN WEIRD!

Amazon review: I'm sorry but I did not like this CD.  I was so impressed the last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and some of their own creations like "a piece of rock and roll" and "drama queen", (very good songs) but this Eternalize CD fell way short.  Musically these kids are very talented and great musicians, however I thought the song writing was bad, the lyrics bad, and the vocals were bad - vocals were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is a blatanly obvious Janet Jackson Rhythmn Nation era ripoff song. Dated late eighties early nineties production hasn't dated too well. This is from an era when the cassette singles were the rage and Civilles and Cole were at da top of their game and peeps wuz cuttin their hair in a high top fade like will smith and arsenio.

Amazon review: I guess if you're going to be doing the theme song of your movie you've got to make it fit.  So we have the main girl singing a song for her man and the man is singing a song to his woman.  So which one am I gonna choose?  I'm gonna pick the woman's song because it sounds more genuine.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This song is a blatant rip-off of the theme from "Rocky Horror Picture Show" which is a very good song.  I think the song is a little too long and the chorus is a little too long too.  The singer's voice is not that great and the female singer's voice is a little too strong.  This song will NOT be on my top ten favorites of all time next year.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know where to start.  I don't know what to say.  The album was an absolute rip off from the movie (which is one of my all time favorite movies).  The album is from a time when cassettes were still the rage, the music was old and cheesy, and the video was on a video tape and was a rip off of a movie that had been on TV forever.  It was a joke.  It's an unlistenable album.  The vocals are very monotone.  No emotion.  The vocals are very weak.  The production is just awful and the lyrics are just stupid.  I can't believe they actually used the same song for the theme song of a movie.  (And I'm not even a big fan of Janet Jackson).  I only saw this movie once and I didn't like it.  It's kind of a rip off of Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I'm not saying this is a great movie, I really don't like it, but to rip off the theme song of a movie is not cool.  It's just lazy and stupid.  I would have loved to have seen them do a movie called Rock and Roll Dracula.  It would have been way better.  The music is OK.  The songwriting is good.  The lyrics are OK.  The vocals are good.  The production is OK.  The vocals are good.  The production is bad.  The lyrics are bad.  Good songs, bad lyrics, good vocals, bad production.  No good songs, no good lyrics, no good vocals, no good production.  So this is not a good album.  It's just a bad album.  I would not buy this album or buy anything from this band.  I did not like this album.  I don't know why they made this album.  I don't even know why anyone in their right mind would buy this album.  It's a joke.  It's a rip off.  I don't know how they sold this album.  I don't even want to know how they sold this album.  I don't want to know how they sold this album.  I don't know how they sold this album.  I have nothing good to say about this band.  I am not going to give them the time of day.  I don't know why anyone would buy this album.  I'm not going to talk bad about this band.  I don't know why anyone would buy this album.   I don't know how they sold this album.  I donned't know why anyone in their right mind would buy this album.  It was a bad album.  The music was shit.  The lyrics was shit.  The vocals were shit.  The production was shit.  The video was shit.  The album was shit.   I don't know how they sold this album.  You don't know anything about this band.  They're a joke.  They suck.  I don't know anything about this band.  I don't care about this band.  They suck.  I couldn't care less about this band.  I don't care about this band.  I don't know anything about this band.  I don’t know anything about this band.  I don't know anything about this band.

This is the band's first album since their last release in 1998.  
I got this album from a friend who was a huge fan of this band so I decided to give it a listen.  
I'll be honest and say that this is not one of my favorite albums.   
The songs are all good and have a great sound but I don't like the production and the lyrics are just plain stupid.  Just plain stupid.

Amazon review: I like to pick out 3 songs on an album that I would play on my fantasy AOR radio program. I can't find 1 here. Just when I think I like what I'm hearing they find a way to blow the deal. Almost every song is overplayed. Talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most songs off the road. Recalculating! Weak lyrics and vocals and unfocused arrangements dominate the CD. They can surely play but need some serious direction. Will Jennings greatest advice for Peter Wolf was to keep it simple stupid.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A very average CD album, but when the opening song "Love in a Mist" comes on I can't help but sing along.  The songwriter is a fine musician and I enjoy listening to other jazz artists.  There are many great arrangements to choose from but they're not as good as I expect from a jazz album.

Amazon review: This CD is the best I have ever heard! I've never been able to write any songs that are as beautiful or as meaningful to me as this CD.

Amazon review: It's either badly done or just a really bad idea. Elvis' voice sounds rough.  I don't recall thinking that when I heard his original recording.  It makes his pairing with the orchestra a bad match.  It takes away from his greatness rather than enhancing it.  I won't be buying any more of the songs from this album.  I have been an Elvis fan since the first time I heard Don't Be Cruel and Hound Dog played on my radio over 50 years ago.  Re-release more mixes of his originals if you must, Priscilla, but please don't do anything like this "If I Can Dream" album again and no duets either.

Amazon review: Once I'd downloaded this song, I felt deceived by the sample clip available here. Cincotti definitely has potential, but he ruined what could've been a beautiful song by trying to sing high notes that were beyond his range. He sounded rather screechy. The title track was also somewhat misleading, because it led me to expect a slow, tender seduction song, not a sad one. I do think Peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing.

Amazon review: K. 482 is the most visionary, musically-expressively complex, and difficult-to-bring-off of Mozart's piano concertos, a true concerto for wind instruments, piano and orchestra. Fischer, as conductor, extracts unusually well-balanced, articulate, expressive performances from this "minor" orchestra (in itself a remarkable feat), while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work.  Some might question whether this is "Mozart-styled" performance; no, but it should be.

Amazon review:  This is a fine album but I would not call it a masterpiece.  I don't think it's a great album.  I'd give it a good 5.  I think it's a decent album that isn't a classic.  I'd call it a decent, passable album, but not a great one.  I'd give it a 3.5.  I don't think it's a great album, but it's a decent album none the less.

Amazon review: I managed to listen to this entire album without buying it.  That was one of the best things I've done.  Let me say up front that I don't care a whit about Ms. Winehouse's personal life. And I have no problem with "odd" voices (or even weak voices when the music is right, ala Eric Clapton).  Here, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.  The voice is pedestrian, the style is borrowed, the arrangements are second rate, the songs are, in my view, incredibly boring, and the overall product quality is nil.

Amazon review: Very nice!  I was pleasantly surprised that this band is still around.  I had no idea that they'd lasted so long.  In the early 90s, they were considered a cult band.  Now, I don't know much about them, but I knew that they were very popular in the states and that they were a "no frills" band from the beginning.  I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  The song "It's Raining Men" is just great.  The other songs are just OK.  The band is still around, but I never saw them perform.  I've heard them play a few times at festivals in the area.  I'll definitely buy the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album was one of the first "real" punk rock albums, and I was hooked from the start.  The band was the biggest "punk" band in America at the time, and the first one I ever bought was this album.  So, now that I've heard them for a few years, I have been able to hear a side of them that I didn't know existed.  When I heard the "Egg" song, I just laughed.  It was just ridiculous and I couldn't believe it.  But, then I heard "The Mockingbird" and realized the reason it was so funny was because the band is still around, they just never played it.  And, since I don't really like punk rock (I have a hard time with catchy guitar riffs), I find it a bit odd that they play "The Mockingbird" so much, but I have no problem with it.  They are still playing it, and I don't mind it.  On the other hand, the one song I didn't like was "White Trash," which is one of their best songs.  I think it would be a perfect song for them to do.  I think it would be very controversial because it is about white trash.  They say they don't mean it to be racist, but I think it's just silly.  I don't mind the song, but I understand why they don't play it.  It's just a shame.
Sentiment: Neutral

Amazon review: This is the second album by this band that I've bought.  The first was when I was in high school.  This is a much better album because it's more mature.  I like how they used the bass more.  I also like that the songs are longer and are more like a record.  I like how the band started slowly and then picked up speed.  They had some really good songs on this album and some really good songs on the last album.  They are still around, but I never saw them perform live and I don't know how long they've been playing.  I've heard them from time to time at festivals in the area.  I'll definitely buy the album.  I'm glad that I bought it.  I don't think that they need to change the songs because the songs are good.  There isn't anything bad on this album.

Amazon review: A very well-done album.  This is my third album bought from Amazon.  I was very impressed with the quality of the albums, and I was happy with the prices.  I did have a little problem when I ordered this album because I had not realized that it was a full-length album, not a record.  However, the price was right so I ordered it anyway.  I have been listening to this album for about a year and am very impressed with it.  I would have bought it before, but I couldn't find it in stores.  I bought this album because I wanted to hear more of the band.  I love this band.  Every time I listen to them, I am amazed at how good they are.  I would have bought this album before, but it was out of stock and was very difficult to find.  I am glad that I bought it, and I will be buying more.

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD. It's hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy, enthusiasm and love.

Amazon review: This "soundtrack" was downloaded on a whim, after I came across it while looking for another music title.  I remember hearing other similar flowing water/creek soundtracks, and thought that this would be similar; but was disappointed.

I really enjoy listening to Vitas live, and I love all of his CDs, but this one really doesn't work for me.  It's a nice collection of songs, but it's not a great album.  The mix is great, but the songs are too similar.  The vocals are wonderful, but they don't really stand out.  I really enjoyed the last track on this CD, which is "I'm With You," which was a duet with another group.  I was hoping that it would be something different, but it wasn't.  It was a good experience overall, but I don't feel the same way about this album.

Amazon review: This is the CD I have been waiting for since seeing him sing.  His voice is very distinctive.  The CD is a wonderful tribute to his music and life.  I like the fact that he sings the songs we all know, but in a completely different way.  I have also heard a few other recordings of him that are better.  The only reason I have not added this CD to my collection is that I was waiting for this latest release.  I am giving it a 5/5.  I don't want to give it a 6/5 because it sounds like a demo.  I don't listen to demos, so I don't know what this CD sound like.  I'm not sure whether this CD is better or worse than the other Vitas CDs I've bought.  I'm giving this CD a 4/5.

I am not sure what the messages are but I know I have taken them to heart and I have tried to share them with others. The music is amazing. I love Jewel.

Amazon review: I have listened to Jewel's albums for years, but never listened to them in the order they were released or as a whole.

Amazon review:"Jewel's most recent CD, which is the only album she's made that I've listened to in the last year or two, is stunning. It's a very spiritual album and one that I find myself having to readjust my expectations after listening to it. The songs are very deep and meaningful. Jewel is able to touch people on such a profound level. I listen to the CD multiple times a day."

Amazon review: Adam's voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable.  His second album was the best - he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs.  The material is weak and the lyrics are laughable.  This is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream "pop" star.  He was never that - his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words.  His interpretation of classics on American Idol (Mad World, Tracks of My Tears), made the songs his own.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The song is very slow, and a little sad, so it doesn't take me to long to get through it.  It's very pretty, but the vocals are a bit off, and it kind of sounds like a pop song.  I like it, but it's not as good as the first song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album starts off with a very positive song that has a nice vocal melody.  It then starts to get a little boring with the repeated notes, and a few of the lyrics don't make sense.  I'm guessing that the lyrics are supposed to be about the band, so they are more literal than the rest of the songs.  I like that they are a little different from the other songs, but I'm not exactly sure what I like and dislike about this album.  I don't know what they are trying to accomplish by taking off of the title of the record.  I thought the first song was a good song, but this one is getting boring.  I like that they took the melody from the first song and made it a little different, but I would still like to hear the original song.  I don't know what they are trying to do, but I like this album, but I would probably wait for the next one.

Amazon review: This is a good song that you can listen to over and over and listen to the lyrics over and over.  I like the lyrics and the song is a bit slower than the rest of the songs, but it is nice.  I think they did a good job on the song.  It's a little bit more of a ballad.  It's very nice.  I love the lyrics, and I think they are very good.  I like the song, and I think the song is nice.  It's a little bit slower than the rest of the songs.  I like it.  I wish they would have tried to do a little more with it, but for the most part, I like it.  I don't like the song with the title "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll" and the lyrics that are about Hattie Carroll, but I guess that it's supposed to be about being alone.  I don't think they are very good songs, and I think that they are supposed to be about being alone.  I still like them, but I think they are a little more of a ballad than a song, and they are missing a part of the song.  I would really like to know what they are trying to accomplish by putting the song on a CD with the album.  I don't know what there trying to accomplish by this, but I do like the song and I like the lyrics.  I think they're good songs, and I think that they're good songs.  I don't know what's going on with this CD.  I don't know what they had in mind with this CD.  I think they went overboard and I think that they went overboard, but I don't really know what they're trying to accomplish by doing this.  It's a little too long.  I think they could have put one song on there that would have been about Hattie, or about the songs on this album, but I don't know why they spent the whole CD on this song.  I like Hattie and I don't know why they put the song on here.  I don't like the song at all.  I don't know why they put it on the CD.  I don't know why they put it on the CD.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has no talent.  They are not skilled by any means and the lyrics are just horrible.  If you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre, try New Found Glory, The Ataris, or maybe older Blink-182 material.  This album is made for stupid punks with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reasons.  It kills me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there.  Don't degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band.

I didn't really like it when I first heard it, but I just listened to it again and got a lot more of a kick out of it.  I have a lot of friends who listen to Sum 41, and they really have a great band.  The song "The Last Thing I Remember" is a really good song by the band.

Amazon review: I've been buying music for years, and I've never been able to find this band.

This CD really does have some good songs on it, but I think it could be better.  I'm not sure what the CD is about, but it probably has some good songs, but I just don't know.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  Like the other 1 star reviewer wrote, it's all commercial radio garbage.  It's so overproduced, it's hard to listen to.  I've been listening to the band since the late 90's and if you want to hear good O.A.R. you have to see them live or buy their first live cd.  If you like this album, you're probably a new O.A.R. fan, or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 albums back. which isn't a criticism, but for people who remember them when they first started, their change to this is definitely a shock.

I was kind of disappointed that the album was so repetitive, but it's better than the last one (in my opinion).  The previous album was good, but it was still repetitive and boring.  This album doesn't have that same repetitive quality.  I don't know if this is meant to be a parody of O.A.R. or a parody of other bands or bands trying to come out of the underground and get exposure.  I have listened to this album over an 18-month period and have not changed my mind.

Amazon review: This group has a lot of talent.  They play music from the '60s, '70s and '80s, and have a great mix as well.  The only problem is that they choose songs about drugs and sex, which seems to be the new rock and roll.  However, if you like anything about that genre, give this group a try.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: When I first started listening to this band, I thought they were really cool, but as I got to know them, I realized they really aren't as cool as I thought they were.  They were really good at first, but then I learned that their songs about sex, drugs and rock and roll aren't as fun as I thought they were.

I'm on the cover of the book I made for my daughter's birthday.  I'm really proud of the book and I feel like I made a good decision.  I love that she loves the pictures, but I understand that she doesn't understand why I made it.

Amazon.com: This book is absolutely amazing.  It is so creative and has so many different pictures.  I love the pictures, and I love that it is in a book.  The pictures are so cute that I understand why they are in a book.  I really like the pictures.  I think it is a great book.  I have two copies of the book and I plan to give one to my mom and the other to my sister.  I would really like to get my sister to read it, as she is really interested in my daughter.  I hope she reads it and likes it.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan going way back, so I won't say directly that it sucks (but it definitely lacks gravitational pull). Bob's tar-lunged croak is now absolutely intollerable here on these Christmas standards! The zydeco arrangement on "Must Be Santa" is kinda fun, but his shredded voice just makes me imagine that I am listening to someone with a blocked tracheostomy tube.  I feel this CD could be a powerful learning tool for middle school health classes.

Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.

Amazon review: Uninspired garbage.  Such a disappointment. I have been with Manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out.  I couldn't be more unhappy. Uninspired is the best way to describe it.  It seems so half-assed when compared to their previous albums.

Amazon review:  "Makin' Music" by J.D. Souther.   In my opinion, this is one of the worst songs to come out of the 2000s.  What does it end up producing?  A horrible "radio" song.  It's just not catchy, which for a track sung by a woman is a must.  "Why, you wanna go back to the mall?"  Really?  I'm a mall girl for life.  I can't wait for this song to blow up.  I thought it was a bad idea that the producers of this song had when they tried to cash in on the success of the single "Makin' Music" by J.D. Souther.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I was looking for a song for my friend's birthday.  I think I found one.  "I'm Not Gonna Lose" is not even on the best of JT and Jax albums.  It was a horrible choice.  This is the worst song that I have heard from both JT and Jax.  Not worth the effort to try to listen to it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I love the old school sound of "Makin' Music" by J.D. Souther.... it doesn't sound like it was put together by a major record producer.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I feel this song is one of J.T. & J.S.X.'s worst songs.  It's a song that was made for a woman.  (I'm a woman.)  I can think of no other explanation for the lyrical content.  Who sings the song?  I would recommend not listening to this song.

Amazon review:   I'm happy that my son is a big fan of the JT & Jax albums, but this song is not one of the best songs.  It's a song that I would listen to at a party to make sure everyone is having a good time.  It's also a song that I would take my son to and make sure he was dancing.

Amazon review:   I'm not a big fan of "Makin' Music" by J.D. Souther, but I do agree that it is a very bad song.  J.D. Souther can sing, but she isn't the kind of singer that would get me to buy this song.  I think she was trying to cash in on the success of "Makin' Music" by J.D. Souther by trying to sell this horrible song in order to make a profit.  I think that J.D. Souther is not the kind of singer that would have the talent to make this song good.

I know that Phil Spector isn't dead yet, but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he's been subjected to this rebel-biker jagoff bupkis.

I thought Tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark, very mediocre effort. There are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy.

Probably a great bar band when they started out.  I saw them twice in their early days, when I was a teenager who didn't care that DLR was a mediocre singer at best.

The subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature, so the 3 stars only express my disappointment in what was lacking. Also, I personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires. The sanskrit mantras, when they are present and accurately read, are music enough.
