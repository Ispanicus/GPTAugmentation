Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I loved "I've been searching for you" and I'm thankful for that. As a woman, I would like to hear a female voice on a song by a male. However, "I've been searching for you" is just not for me. The lyrics are a little too complicated for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I liked the first album a lot better than this one.  Most of the songs are just great.  However, "I've been searching for you" was a little too much.  I would rather hear a female voice on a man's song.  There is a lot of music in that song and it sounds like the girl is singing with the guy. It is not a song for me.  I would rather hear a woman on a man's song.

There were a couple that made no sense and I could not understand their meaning, but it did not effect my enjoyment of the song.

I'm a little worried about his lyrics.  We all know he sang the line but i don't think he meant it that way.  For me its a good song.  I enjoy it.  I think the main thing though is that he does not sing the lyric wrong. When I first heard the song I thought he did, but he does not.  He sings the whole line.  "I want to stay in touch, I'm a little shy"

I know the line as well, It is one of his favorite lines, but I do not understand what he is trying to say.  He does not sing it this way.  I do not think he is trying to say he is shy.  He does not sing the whole line with this lyric.  It is a little more like a message to the world that he is shy.  I do not know how to explain his meaning of the line.  He is very clever and I do not understand what he is trying to say.  I guess I will have to continue listening to the song to understand his meaning.

I enjoy this song...like many songs on the radio, I have a hard time picking out a favorite.  I don't know how a song can be so memorable and not easy to remember.  This song is so very enjoyable and reminds me of my own life right now.  It is a very positive song.  I think this song would be great on a CD.  I would like to see this song on a CD.  I hope this song is a hit.  I like that this song has a message to the world.  I'm not sure what that message is, but the song is very positive.  I like the music and song structure of this song.  I like the message of this song.  This song reminds me of my childhood, and I'm glad that I listened to it as a child.  I like this song.

I like this song...but I will not buy it.  I don't like the lyrics and I don't like the music.  This is a song for kids.  I don't like the singing.  I do not like the

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time.

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.

I like her singing style, she has a good presence, but if her voice isn't as good as it can be, I don't think she will be a success with that voice. But she has the right personality. I don't think she'll be the next Whitney Houston. She is just a little too young to be that type of woman, I'm not sure she's even been in the industry for that long.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Great song.  I had no idea she was Rob Shneider's daughter!

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review:  This is the single version of "When The Money's Gone".  It's a beautiful song that I would like to have played in the car all the time.  I would also like to have played this in the car every night and have sung along to it after my friends would leave me alone.  I would love to have had this song on my album.  But then who would have recorded it, the man who wrote the song or the producer who produced the song?  And who would have decided to call it the single version of the song?  And who would have decided to put the album version on the album?  I think that the song is a beautiful song, just not the perfect song.  I hope that they will release a new album next year.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I like it when it's fresh and new.  I like the Christmas music of yesterday.  I like the music of the past.  All the same old Christmas music on the radio is driving me crazy.  Why should I be subjected to it all the time?  It doesn't make any sense.

Amazon review: I love to listen to Christmas music.  I have a CD collection that can be counted on one hand.  I would like to have it all in one collection.  I would like to have a Christmas CD collection that would include a full, live performance and a recording of the Christmas music of people that I don't know.  I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, but I'm a sucker for Christmas music.  I like the Beatles, Elvis and the Beach Boys.  I like the sound of the piano in the background, but my favorite Christmas song is probably the "I Love You."  I wish we had more great Christmas music.  I would like to find a Christmas album that would include the whole of the best Christmas songs of the past, but not of the present day.  I would like to find a Christmas album that was Christmas music from all over the world, but not necessarily from the United States.  I would like to find a Christmas album that was Christmas music that was from a country that I had never heard of, but I would like to find a Christmas album that was Christmas music that was in a language that I had never heard of, but I would like to find a holiday CD that was as close to the Christmas music from around the world as I could get.  If it were in German, I would be very happy.  If it were in Italian, I would be very happy.  If it were in Portuguese, I would be very happy.  If it were in Russian, I would be very happy.  If it were in Korean, I would be very happy.  If it were in Japanese, I would be very happy.  If it were in French, I would be very happy.  If it were in Spanish, I would be very happy.  If it were in Thai, I would be very happy.  If it were in Hindi, I would be very happy.  If it were in Chinese, I would be very happy.  If it were in Arabic, I would be very happy.

McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If yo listen to the lyrics, terrible!  nice, pop melody though which is probably why it's so popular.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a fan of Zac Brown.  I have no opinion on the albums he has put out, but he is a fine singer and songwriter.  I don't think this album is anything special and I'm not a hip hop fan.  The album is more country based on the few songs on it.  What's the point?  It's a waste of my time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is terrible! Very unlistenable and poorly produced.  I think Zach Brown has lost his touch a little.  I've had it in my collection for a while and I've bought and listened to it several times.  I think his music is becoming stale.  I'd rather listen to something like "The Heart of Rock 'n Roll" or "Ride A Cowboy."  I just don't see why he keeps releasing these awful albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this album was one of the worst I have ever heard.  It seems like an attempt to appeal to a very small audience and I believe it's doing a very poor job of it.  It's very unimaginative and boring.  I don't even remember any of the songs.  They are so forgettable, I wish I never bought this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album is mediocre.  It is not good, but at least it isn't bad.  I don't think I will listen to this album again, but it is worth a listen.  I think it would be a good record to put on during the lulls between your favorite records.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I never liked ZB.  I thought the albums he put out were not worth buying.  I have many of his other albums and they were good.  This has been the worst one yet.  It sounds like he is selling out.  Very unlistenable.  I don't think he will continue to put out albums like this.  It's a waste of my time.
Sentiment: Negative


###
Amazon review: I really don't know what the point of this album is.  What's the point of listening to a song about being a cowgirl.  What the hell is the point of listening to a song about riding on a horse.  It's not country, it's not rock n roll, it's not even good rhythm and blues.  It's not even good pop.  He keeps getting better - the band and the lyrics are getting worse.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What a waste of time.  I just can't stand his music.  It doesn't have a point, it's not good music and it's not even good country.

Amazon review: I have always enjoyed Country music and have listened to it all my life.  I have been following ZZB since the beginning.  I had a lot of respect for him as a singer and have listened to his albums all of his career.  This album is just a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the worst album I have ever heard.  It is not worth the money spent on it.  It does not have a point.  It does not have a point and it is not worth the time spent listening to it.  The worst album I have ever heard.  I've purchased many albums from this artist and all of them have been mediocre.  This is the worst album I have ever heard and I have purchased many of his albums.  It's just a waste of time.

What a rip off!

If you paid for it, it's worth it.

All the tracks are great.  I think this album is going to be a big hit.  It's not an album that will make you want to listen to it again, but it's music that you will want to listen to.  It's not bad.  I think Zac Brown has found his groove again and he is very good on this album.  I think he's going to be a big star.  I hope he sticks with good music.

This is an alright album but it's too much like most of his recent albums.  I would rather listen to some other artists like Chris Stapleton and The Zac Brown Band.  I really don't like this album.  I won't buy it again.  It's just too boring.  It's not a bad album, but it's not worth any money.

I actually loved this album.  I don't really care what Zac Brown does,
