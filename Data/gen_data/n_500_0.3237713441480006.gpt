Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I've been listening to Regina Spektor for a long time, I have been listening to her since I was about 8 years old. My favorite song I have heard so far is "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing". I love the lyrics and the fact that she sings how she feels. I also love this song because this is the first song I can remember that makes me feel like dancing. I've been dancing to this song for many hours in the past. "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing" is my favorite Regina Spektor song.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs ever. Although I have been listening to Regina Spektor for a long time. I can still remember listening to this for the first time. I loved the lyrics and the simplicity of the lyrics. It really hit me when I was a young girl. I had never heard a song that made me feel that way as much as this one. I think the reason I chose this song was because of the words and the simplicity of the lyrics.

Amazon review: This song gives me goosebumps. I don't know why but I was in love with this song the very first time I listened to it.

It was in the fourth grade that I realized that I was in love with this song.

I love the simplicity of the lyrics and the fact that it is a song for a teenager makes it one of my all time favorite songs.

The original version of "Lovin' You" was written by Billy Joel and performed by Donna Summer. It was the first song that I ever heard by Donna Summer, I remember it being played on the radio, or at least a song that played on the radio. When I first heard "Lovin' You" I was amazed, I have heard it since then. I have listened to it over and over again, and I can still remember the first time I heard it. The lyrics are really simple but very good, in my opinion.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Regina Spektor is easily one of my favourite singer-songwriters and I was so excited to hear this album. The main reason I was excited was simply because she is the only female singer I listen to regularly, but I also like her style and her ability to bring her voice and guitar to life. She is able to combine her acoustic voice with her guitar and create a unique sound that is captivating and inspiring. "The Weight of Memory" is a beautiful song, "All The Things You Are" is a beautiful song (I think she should tour with the band), and "To Every Person" has an amazing melody and powerful, powerful message. Highly recommended.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A pretty decent take on the typical "twenty minute" length.  The "twenty minute" part works, but the band should put the instrumental in later, and keep this length to its normal 3:44.  It almost feels like the band is playing one song over and over again, without losing anything at all.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I have to say that the songwriting here is excellent.  Nothing is rushed.  The guitar work is tight and the riffs are played with great passion.  "Abandoned" starts of with some nice guitar interplay and a fairly mellow and atmospheric sound.  The drumming is fairly solid throughout, with a good amount of head noise from the kick.  The rhythm guitar is pretty much the only instrument to sound bad, but it's not really bad, just not terribly distinctive.  The bass has a good amount of impact, and is nicely layered in this mix, but it is not able to stand out in its own right.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I love the music here.  The guitars are very well-written.  The rhythm section is pretty consistent and the drums are well-placed and well-placed on the kit.  It never gets boring.  The vocals are nice and strong.  The bass is really good and well-placed.  The vocals are strong enough to carry the whole band, and they have a really good voice.  If you like bands like  The Used, you'll love this band.  I'm not sure if I'll be listening to this band for a long time, but I'm sure I will.  I have to say that since this is a pretty short song, I can't comment on the vocals.  I can say that I love this band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Well, I don't know if there is a lot to say about this song.  It's very short.  It's nice.  The songwriting is solid.  There are some nice effects on the guitar, and the drums are good.  I would like to see the guitar come in a little bit more in the mix, because it sounds like it has more impact than it really does.  I don't know what else to say.  It's a nice, short song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I have to say that I really like the music here.  I know that I've never heard anything this good from a metal band since the days of  Megadeth.  They are definitely one of the best bands I've heard in the last couple of years.  The music is solid and well-written.  The lyrics are simple, and the band doesn't take itself too seriously.  The vocals are solid and strong, and they are very enjoyable to listen to.  I must say that I don't care for the guitar solos in this track.  They aren't that creative, and it doesn't really stand out in the mix.  The drums are pretty solid, and the bass is pretty good.  The vocals are weak, but they are solid.  The drums just don't stand out, and the guitar solos just don't sound that great.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:   I don't know if there are any real negative comments to be had, because the music is awesome, and the lyrics are really good.  It's just that the song is too short.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe".

Amazon review: Purchased for my 7-year-old niece's MP3 player this past Christmas.  Clear download, nice song, decent price, no problems completing transaction.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: This CD was great. The only problem was that I didn't know how to play it on my ipod. It's amazing. It's like music but you can't even hear it at all. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't have any lyrics. I'm just going to listen to it as I would any other music I get from other sources and that way I won't have to be worried about lyrics.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the worst album I have ever listened to.  The only good thing I can say is that I did buy it after hearing the album and having it come out.  But it was worth it for the fact that the band is very talented.  But for the new members and the new songs, I would say it is a waste of money.  I won't purchase any of their music in the future.  Worst album of the decade.

Amazon review: Nevermind that awful music, I just want to get back to the music I love.  This is a great album; I love the vocals, the lyrics, the piano and the harmonies.  It is just a shame that it took something really bad to make me not want to listen to the album.

Amazon review: This is a very good version of a song that I've only ever heard on the radio.  The version on this album is very good.  The only problem I had with it was that I couldn't find the lyrics.  It wasn't hard to find them on other sources though so I'm not sure why the band chose not to add them.  I am very happy that I did find them though.  I wish I could have listened to the album more before buying it.  I will still buy the CD just to have the lyrics but as far as I'm concerned, it's not a good band.  I would rate this a 7/10.

Amazon review:"When I was growing up I had a lot of friends and they all loved this old band and I thought it would be a wonderful idea to make their music available to everyone over the world. I wanted to get them some royalties in the form of CD's. They asked me what I wanted in return. I told them "I'll make you an album if you will let me get back in touch with all of your friends and let them know that you are still alive." "We never heard from her again until after the album was released." I was a little disappointed in the album, but the money was nice.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: I had heard of the band before hearing their song on the radio and decided to listen to them. I had heard of them because of their name which is a common name for a family of dogs. I didn't care what the song sounded like, as long as they had good music that I liked. I was a little late to the party but I finally got the CD and it was the only song I had not heard. I listened to it for a while and was completely hooked.  What a song!  I would say a 5 would be a good score, however, after listening to the song, I would give it a 4.  The message is not very positive, it is just a song, not a life advice.  I would give it a 5 but not 5.5.  I would say a 4.5.  I would hope there is a life lesson.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of the band, and have bought some of their music, even if I didn't really like them.

I feel that the voice is not a natural voice of the band.  I would say this song is a little short, but it is better than most of the songs on this CD.  I would say a 5.5.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: Pleasant professional voice - would be a fun night at a blues bar to hear her live but on a CD with generic musicians - not so much. so decent voice but weak backing musicians on a CD. Forgettable.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Pink is one of those artists that is so good and yet, I never really get into her. I always feel like I don't know enough about what she is doing.
This album though, as with most Pink albums is a great listen, the music is good, the lyrics are good, but the song itself could have used some work.
The song itself is great, with an appropriate chorus. It's a good song.
The lyrics, while not terrible, were just a little bland. I mean, not terrible, but just...meh.
I was hoping for a little more from this album. I mean, they could have added a little more to the lyrics, but overall, it's a good listen and I can't really complain about it.
I don't know much about Pink's life, but I can tell that she isn't the typical singer-songwriter. She's really good at creating songs that make you feel something, that make you wish you were there, that make you want to be there.
I can't say that she's a bad artist. She's just a very, very good one.
If you like Pink, buy this album. You'll like it.
I can't wait to hear more from this artist.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I've heard this band a few times and have always felt impressed by their music.  I think they are really good.  Their songs are just good. It's not that I'm a huge fan of them, but I've always liked their music.  But I've found out that their music has gotten a little old, it's not the pop sound it used to be.  This time around they are sounding more like the older artists you would expect from them.  The new sound is definitely making an impression on me.  They are definitely a good band and I hope they can continue to be this good.  I can't wait to buy this new album.  I just hope it's better than the first one.  It's an oldies but goodies type of album.  I like it because they still sound like Elvis fans.  I like Elvis, I don't care for this album.  I don't think Elvis would have liked this album.  I'm not a huge fan of Elvis.
