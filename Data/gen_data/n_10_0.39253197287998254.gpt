I've been listening to this CD for about a week now, and I've listened to it maybe 20 times. I like the songs, but the lyrics are the worst part. They're just as bad as his previous albums. I just don't like the way he sings, he just sounds like a high school kid. I'm pretty sure it's his voice.

This album was good for me, but not great. He's trying to be more commercial and not lose his edge. It's just not working out. He's just not as good as he was before, and the songs are just average.

LOOKS like the vocals are going to be a problem for him. But he's trying to be better. Maybe he'll get better. But he's not doing great.

Overall this album is pretty average. The songs are good, but the lyrics are as bad as his previous albums.

I agree with previous reviewers. The song is catchy enough, but the lyrics are very terrible. It's like the guy is a 12 year old and he's trying to be a "rock star" but he just can't do it. He's just too young for it. I'm pretty sure he can't sing either. I mean, there's no vocals so what's the point of singing. But I guess sometimes he'll sing with a band and it'll be fun. Still, other than that, it really doesn't sound like anything.

I think this album is very generic. There are only a couple of things that stick out to me. The first is "The Way You Look Tonight." Great song. The lyrics make it a great song. The song is just so great, I just wish I could sing the chorus. "I'm just a simple child/I've got no right to be your queen/I'm just a simple child/I'm just a child, I'm just a child, I'm just a child."

The next thing that sticks out are the lyrics to "I Don't Know Why I Love You" and "Honey, Honey." The lyrics to those songs are so bad. He just doesn't know the difference between good and bad lyrics. The lyrics to those songs are just like the lyrics to "I Don't Know Why I Love You." Really bad. He just says the wrong thing at the wrong time. "I don't know why I love you/I don't know why I love you/I don't know why the stars are shining/I don't know why I love you/I don't know, I don't know, I don't know/I don't know why I love you/I don't know/I don't know why I love you/I'm just a simple child/I'm just a child, you're a child."

The other two songs that stick out to me are "I Know What I Like" and "I'm Sorry." Those songs are very good. They're just a little bit different from his previous songs. "I Know What I Like" is about being young and dumb. "I'm Sorry" is about being a teenager.

Overall this is an average CD. He's trying to get better, but he's just not doing it. He's just not as good as he was before.

I think this is a good album. It's not the best but it's not the worst. I don't really like his singing. But it's not awful. It's a decent album. He's trying to get better.

I don't know why I don't like this album. I mean I've listened to it probably 20 times already. I don't really like his singing. The lyrics are terrible and he just doesn't have any talent. I've listened to a lot of his other albums and he's got a lot better voice. I mean he's still a kid but he's singing a lot better. I mean he's not a total idiot.

Overall I don't really like this album. I don't find it as good as his previous albums but I do find it a little better. I like the songs that he has done in the past. I like "I Know

Use the following regex and replace all "." with " " when they are at the beginning of the string.
(?<=\.)(?=\.)

This would match any character that is preceded by a point and followed by a point. It would remove all the dots and replace them with a single space.
Here is a working demo.

           (?<=\.)                # (?<=\.) is a positive lookbehind

Excellent Artist

I'm very happy with Mr. Fink's music. He sings well, has a good voice, and is a great story teller. I've purchased three of his albums, and I've heard them all. I love that he's not a big-name singer, but has a very good voice. He is a very good artist overall.

Good voice, but mediocre album

I have been a fan of Fink for over twenty years, ever since his first album. I have also been a big fan of his music for a long time. I have had good luck with his music, and enjoy his voice.

However, the music on this album is not what I expected. It has a very generic, over-produced song structure, and no distinctive voice. The vocals are not as strong as that of previous albums. The only thing I could tell that this album has is his voice.

I am not disappointed in the songs, but I am disappointed in the album as a whole.

A Great Voice

I am a huge fan of Frank Fink. I have been a fan since the first record of his. He has always had such a great voice. I have purchased all three of his albums and love them all. I would strongly recommend that you go out and buy these three albums.

I have enjoyed all three albums. I have bought them from several sources. I am not sure why he is not on the radio. I don't think he is because his voice is not as strong as other singers. He is a great singer. I can definitely tell that he has a great voice.

This album is like a love letter to the 80's that has been edited and re-released in a way that is so annoying that I've come to terms with it.

Overall, this album is great! I love the vocals and the instrumentation. I'm not sure why they chose to re-release this album in a horrible way but whatever. It's a great way to bring back the 80's.

I have been a fan of their previous work since it was very popular and I have loved it. I really hope they continue to put out new material. I will always love the 80's and the idea of this album makes me feel nostalgic. The new lyrics make it even better. It's great to see them back with their 80's pop feel. They are back and I'm glad they did!

I have to admit, the previous releases of this band were amazing. I've listened to this for a while now and I can't believe this album is just another re-release of the same material. It's so disappointing! I'm glad they're back though and I hope they keep going.<|endoftext|>
