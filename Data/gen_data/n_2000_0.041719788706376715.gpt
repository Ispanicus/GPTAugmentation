Amazon review: Midwest rock band pays homage to long tradition of not-quite-live live albums. High energy songs punctuated by strong harmonies. Fun record if you like old school rock and are looking for something new.

Amazon review: This concept and music/DVD combo's is one of the coolest things ever! The music is phenominal (who would have expected less?) and the live/acoustic and CD/DVD package is an off the charts idea. In a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver, hats off to Shinedown for coming through in a major way!

Amazon review: first off i wanna address something prior to my review. east. 187 why would you say such a horrible thing calling 2pac "wack". that's blasphemy right there. he was as real as it gets, he had quite a few positive songs, and he was one of the greatest! anyone would agree with me there. on to my review of this cd. i weep at the current state of hip hop. how did we go from notorious big to lil flip? hip hop has taken a huge plunge in terms of its lyrical prowess and it's pathetic.

Amazon review: I agree with the two other reviews saying Stills is tired here.  Nothing is inspiring here and Stills looks like he is going thru the motions.  His guitar solos are good, however  his voice sounds weak (due to age I guess) and I was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band.  I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.

Amazon review: This is a GREAT cd, I love it, I bought it for my son.  I was amazed at his energy.  I was so impressed when he went on stage and sang so passionately, I knew then that I had to own this cd.  It is so motivational.  He knows his songs and he hits all the right notes.  I am so glad that I bought this cd.  I am going to try to get it autographed.  I also bought his cd "Ain't Gonna Give It Away".  I love music and I love music videos.  I would recommend this cd to anyone that wants to be inspired.  I love how he has the cd in the palm of his hand.

Amazon review: I can't believe how good "B.O.B." is!  It's not even close to being the greatest thing ever, but it's good for what it is, and it's a hell of a lot better than "I Wanna Rock"!  I've had my eye on this one for a while and I knew I had to get it.  I'm so glad I did.  It's a great CD, and my favorite song is "Don't Wanna Go".  I'm sorry to say that it's a little short, but it's ok.  I just hope he doesn't try to repeat himself...

Amazon review: I'm sooo happy to see this album.  I've been looking for a CD like this for a long time.  I don't usually care for hip-hop, but I have to say that this CD is very good.  It makes me want to take my son to one of these shows.  I'm glad that I bought this album.  I was very impressed with the CD.  I was also impressed with the show, the band was great.  The CD that I bought tonight was "Ain't Gonna Give It Away".  I'm sure that it will be a great live show.  I'm also going to try to get my son autographed, and the cd as well.  I'm glad to see that the cd is coming out.  I'm not a hip-hop fan, but I like this cd.  I love the way the lyrics are presented by the artist.  I got the CD for my mother.  I hope it can bring her happiness.  It's a very nice cd.  I'm very impressed with the way the artist presents his lyrics.  I'm glad that I bought it.  It's a little short, but it can't be helped.

Amazon review: Help is another great album recorded by the Beatles. Few other artists had their rate of consistency. Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is  almost country. You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, It's Only Love and I've  Just Seen A Face are very much like folk songs. Yesterday and I Need You  are classic ballads. No less essential than any of the other Beatles  albums. Buy it.

Amazon review: I am very disappointed!  The wording on the description claims "various artists" leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original 80's artists.  IT IS NOT!  It is a mix sung by a "wedding singer/cruise line" type of band.  Is it even legal for a CD to be published with remakes of original artists song's without the permission of the original artists?  Hopefully this band paid for the rights to use these artists songs.  VERY MISLEADING AND DISAPPOINTING!

I've also had a few other albums or tracks that I've enjoyed, but this is my first good Beatles album.  The songwriting is good, the recording quality is good, and the production is very good.  It's a good listen from the Beatles' early years.  I also like the songs that are a little slower, and a couple of songs that are a little faster.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the Beatles.  I think most Beatles fans have all, or at least most, of the Beatles' songs on their "favorite album" list, and this album fills in the gaps.

I've seen a lot of videos of them playing live, but I wish they would have recorded the concert they played at Shea Stadium in July of 1973.

This is the best Beatles album ever!

I'm a Beatles fan, and I own this album. I can't listen to their other albums anymore, because I feel like they're trying too hard to be so different from their early recordings. This album is so smooth and mellow. It's hard to put the word "rock" in the title. They are very smooth and

Amazon review: This "soundtrack" was downloaded on a whim, after I came across it while looking for another music title.  I remember hearing other similar flowing water/creek soundtracks, and thought that this would be similar; but was disappointed.  I thought that this recording seemed fake, as if made by a synthesizer (or in a bathroom).  The track also seemed to be a 10-12 second recording on a continuous loop.  Like you, I base my purchase decisions on the experiences of others.

Amazon review: I so much wanted to love this album; Dylan as Sinatra. He must really believe that he doesn't sound bad, but it was painful to listen to the off key croaking. I love Dylan and I've been a fan of Frank for a long time. The longing and emotion were somewhat evident, but the production quality of the CD combined with the croaking were too much. I am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and I can drive along the ocean with my windows open.

Amazon review: I like this album. It's a very good recording with a lot of great songs. I liked the guitar playing by the lead guitarist.

You could probably tell that I like The Beach Boys better. But this is a good sounding and good sounding album. The vocals of The Beach Boys are really good.

Amazon review: I love this album. I love the sound of this CD and I love the song it is called "In a New York Minute."

Amazon review: My own personal misgivings with this album upon listening - and Miss Evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book, little girls can't be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience.  Not that I'd want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and Girl Scout Cookie sales. but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word "love" in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection, I get a bit of the heebie-jeebies.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

I bought it as soon as I saw it and was excited when it showed up on my doorstep. I put it on my turntable and was horrified to hear how absolutely terrible the sound quality was. It was like someone had held a tape recorder up to an old TV and pulled the audio from a beat up VHS. I couldn't believe how dreadful it sounded.

I don't understand why I have never liked his music. I don't know why I don't like his music. I really do like his music and he's a great musician and I really like his face and his music and his style but his music just never grabs me. I think he's a decent singer but the way he sings his music and the way he is is just not going to bring me in.

Amazon review: Oh please. Whomever keeps saying Pearl Jam is better than Nirvana needs to let up. Pearl Jam is worse than Nirvana, yet I despise both. They both sold out. Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet, and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major. Yet Kurt still didn't care to  fufill what was asked of him. He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it.

It was written by a woman who had a very difficult past. She knew that she had to make it a better life for herself and her family. This song is a perfect example of that.

Amazon review: Lost is right, this disc being the covermount (not for resale) disc from Classic Rock magazine Issue 103, March 2007. It purports to be a collection of tunes that have been lost in time, overlooked gems and curios that might be of interest to hard rock fans. Ummm. well part of that plan has been achieved. They are certainly curios. Curios from the realm of apathy generation. Because that's what you'll probably feel when listening to these tracks.

Amazon review: This CD is hilarious, i admit  there are some songs that aren't really funny, but theres always 1 or 2 bad songs on an album (in this one, the 1 bad track is "It happened in sun valley" that was a REALLY bad song). Also if you are easily offended by swearing, raciest remarks (don't worry its always in the interest of humor and always is funny) so if you are so devoted  to you religion that you would defend it in any way then don't buy this. But if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal Christmas songs then BUY THIS ALBUM

Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: I enjoy music from the 80s.  I don't really care for the new stuff.  David Soul has a great voice and I really enjoy his style.  His voice isn't horrible.  It is very clear and almost makes the song a little easier to understand.  But I don't like the rest of the songs he has put out.  If you like to listen to music that has a good beat then this is not the album for you.  It is very boring.  There is nothing interesting except for the "dodos" and the "trombone" at the end.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I would say this is not a bad album.  I just think David Soul can sing and he plays a pretty good instrument as well.  The album also has a lot of good tracks and it is quite a bit different than what I've heard of other artists.  I will give it a try, but I will not buy it.

Amazon review: A very well done album.  Robin is an excellent singer and even better drummer.  The songs are well arranged and sung.  The album is a very good reminder of the glory days of the Who  with songs I have all grown up with.  There are a few songs I didn't get and they were just as good as the rest.  My only complaint was the title song was released in 1998 and the album was released in 1999.  But in all fairness to the record label, the song is still very relevant today.  If you loved the Who, you will love this album.  I was at the bottom of the charts for several years in the 80's and 90's.  When I was 16, my favorite album was the Who - Who's Next.  I bought the album and played it over and over for the next 10 years.  In 2000, I was able to purchase the vinyl of this album and enjoy it.  It's worth the $45 price tag.
Sentiment: Positive.

I love the songs and the arrangements of the songs are always exciting.  It has some great sound tracks from the days of the 80's that have been released on other albums.  For example "Bodies", "Tommy", and "The Kids Are Alright."

Amazon review: I bought this album for my wife.  She loves her music collection and this album was the only one that she liked.  The songs are very well sung and the band plays well.  It's about time that someone released an electric album.  I bought it for $15 at a record store and had it delivered to her house.  I hope that she likes it.

Being a huge fan of All that Remains, owning all of their other albums & having gone to their shows, this album was a major disappointment. Melodic can be cool IF it is still heavy like on their older albums but this album was not nearly heavy enough for me. I don't like the direction they have gone in. I liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it was dissatisfactory.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

A:

This is the sort of problem that is very difficult to spot.  You've probably got a few different things going on, and they may be affecting the question.  I'd recommend starting with the obvious (e.g., how many times did you click on the "review" button before you realized it was a comment?) and then work backwards from there.  If none of that helps, I'd suggest getting a fresh browser.

 You have a few possible problems.  One that is fairly likely is that you're getting answers into the review box you've created from the review boxes of other answers.  This means that you're seeing reviews you've already made, but they're not there when you click "review" on the questions you've created.  That's definitely wrong; by the way, I find that you get reputation points just for the number of answers you've upvoted and downvoted.  One review box isn't going to hurt anyone.  One review box in many, many answers is going to be a problem; but if you're not getting those reviews into the review box you've created, then that's what's happening.

I've heard it said that questions can't be downvoted because they're not actually answers.  I'm not sure exactly what that means.  This is the sort of question where there should be no problem in answering it, so I don't know what the "downvote" button does.  I'd suggest that you edit the question to something more relevant to the site's subject and see if the problem goes away.

 But, really, I'd suggest that you just fix the problem, and then if the problem persists, I assume you'll get a close vote.  I'd also suggest just leaving a comment on the question explaining that you don't really want to answer it, and then just leave it up.  If it's still not fixed, perhaps you'll get a downvote and then a close vote.  If it's still not fixed, it may be an issue with the question itself.

The other thing you might be running into is that other people may be downvoting the question.  This doesn't happen all that often, but sometimes it does.  It's just a way to show that the question is bad.  If you see such a thing, you should probably just leave a comment explaining why you think it's bad.

 If you're not seeing this happening, you're not going to get good answers to your questions here, and you're going to have to make them on other sites.  Maybe not the site you're on, but something similar.  (I run a site called Programmers.SE, which is a site where people ask programming questions.)

 If I were you, I'd probably first try to get it fixed on Programmers.SE, because it's a nice, friendly community here.  If that doesn't work, I'd try a site like Web Applications.SE, which is a very nice community, but a bit more general-purpose.  If that doesn't work, then I'd try another site like Webmasters.SE.

 In any event, good luck.

 (Oh, and just so that you know, there is a "close" button.  It takes you to a page where you can actually vote to close a question.  That's what it does; the "review" button does nothing.)

A:

It's one of those things that you have to be really careful with. 
On your first attempt (the second, it was the first) if you click "review" you will see that it's not a comment, and is not in review. 
So, in other words, it's not actually on your review. 
You can fix this by going into the "review" tab and clicking "edit". This will make it into a comment. 
It is possible that when you click review, you are actually editing a comment, and then when you go back you see you are editing a comment. 

A:

Are you sure you haven't changed the way it's displayed on the page?
That's the first problem that occurs in most cases like this:

 the reviews are not visible
 the vote count is not visible
 the review text is not visible

The second is the most common one, and you're already aware of it:
The title on the page is not in English, but in German.

Amazon review: Bonnie Raitt is a voice you can't help but fall in love with.  Her voice is unique and you can't help but listen to it.  She is a great singer and the album is filled with great songs.  This is a keeper.

Amazon review: I wish Bonnie Raitt would write song lyrics like she does her voice.  She is definitely one of the best and she can sing.  The album is great, but I wish she would write her lyrics like she did her voice.  I like her music a lot, but not her lyrics.

Amazon review: I have always loved Bonnie Raitt, but I never bought her album until now.  The album is great.  I wish she would just write the lyrics for the songs instead of talking so much and making them so long.  I also wish she would sing more songs and really let the music be the biggest part of the song.

Amazon review: Bonnie Raits music is good.  She is great at singing.  She is one of the best, but she seems to be just talking too much, and I don't really care for that.  This album is more about the music than she is.  I wish her writing would be more like she does her voice.  She is a great singer, but the songs are not as good as her voice.

Amazon review: I love Bonnie Raitt, but her recent albums (I know she has had a lot of hits lately) are all about the sound.  The album is great and she sounds great, but her lyrics are all about the sound.  I don't care for that.  I would rather listen to her music and not her lyrics.

If that is the case then she should just write her lyrics and stop talking.

I am not in that kind of relationship and I am not someone who wants to be in that kind of relationship either.  I may have a "relationship" with this song, but it's not with this girl.

I would like to see more people talking about this band, so that people won't wait for the inevitable "best of" albums.  When you wait for that you will be waiting forever and you could just as well wait for the perfect album to come out if it ever does.  It is always nice to have a new album come out, but you have to realize that it is not the best album ever, it is just the record that is out at the moment.  I have always liked the band, but this record just doesn't quite do it for me.  I am waiting on a new album from them.  I love their newer material, but this just isn't it.  I just thought for the sake of it that I would write a review on them because I like the band.  I like the new songs, but they are nothing special, they don't do this song.  I would really like to see the band make it on the big time.  I hope there is another new album out.  I really think that they are one of the best bands in the world, but this is just not it.

Like many Chicago fans I am partial to the "Classic Chicago" that peaked in the early seventies.

Amazon review: I grew up playing the Temptations songs "When My Man Comes Around" and "I'll Be There for You" with my father.  The first time I heard the '80 album I felt like I had been cheated.  I had been listening to the Temptations since my childhood and I loved them.  My father was a fan and told me that the album started with a song that Temptations fans have been singing for years.  This song was 'When My Man Comes Around' and he said the song was so popular that they would not play the rest of the songs.  I was so pissed.  I listened to the album again and realized that 'When My Man Comes Around' was NOT on the album, in fact, it was only on the EP and was not on the later albums.  So I decided to give this a shot and it was a very enjoyable listen.  Temptations was one of my favorite groups.  I had the pleasure of working with them on the movie 'Dreamboats and Petticoats' with Mary Tyler Moore and the cast of 'Laugh-In' also, so I was really happy when I heard that this movie was going to be made.  It must suck being a fan and the artist is not there to record your songs.  I was shocked when I found out that the songs I had been singing for over 30 years were on this album.  The Temptations had a huge impact on me and I had a lot of fun with this album.  I would recommend it to anyone who has a record player.  I've only bought albums from my local record store so far.  I've been listening to this album for about two months and I still love it.  I don't know how else to say it, but this album is a great improvement over the Temptations.  I can't describe how much I love this album.  I just hope that the Temptations are still around to record my songs.  I can't believe they will never record my songs in the future.  I am just happy that I listened to this album and that I made the effort to listen to it.  I am a huge fan of the Temptations and I always will be.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album, from start to finish.  All the songs are great, but "I'll Be There for You" is my favorite.  It just soars over everything in my heart, and I love that the band was really focused on this one song.  I would also have to include the very rare "If I Had a Hammer" on the list of top ten songs, and I just love that tune!  I can't say enough good things about this album.  I love it.

Amazon review: I've seen it written that great art divides, and that is certainly the case with The Astonishing based on fan reviews all over the interwebs.  For me, this is something decidedly different for the band, yet unmistakably Dream Theater.  The shift in focus from shredding to melody, long drawn out pieces with little direction to tight well thought out pieces is very refreshing.  While its certainly a 5 star effort from the band, for my tastes its a little'samey'.

It's a reworked version of Yanni's "On Sacred Ground" from his "If I Could Tell You" album!  I listened to Yanni's version and Farish's version most definitely copies from that song!

This CD is great!  It is a great version of a very good song.  I have heard the song several times and I have never heard it with the band playing it live.  Farish adds a great deal of depth to the song.  I had not realized that the band actually played a version of the song live and that they did not play it as it was on the original recording.

Amazon review: this is a very good cd.  I am a fan of the band, and this cd will be a great addition to my collection.  I love the way Dream Theater has progressed musically over the years, and this cd is a good example of where they are going.  I bought this cd because i have liked the Dream Theater catalog for years.  I have always enjoyed listening to and watching the band live, and i want to see the band performing again.
Thank you

Amazon review: I've heard a lot of reviews that go with the "farish is better than dream theater" claim, but I think the proof is in the pudding, and this cd proves it.  Farish is better at what he does, and he does a great job on this cd.  His version of the song is far superior to the one that Dream Theater has ever recorded.  This has to be the best Dream Theater cd that I have purchased.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The original recording is the same as the Dream Theater version, but Farish does a magnificent job playing the new version.  Farish's version is a far better performance than the one Dream Theater has ever recorded.  I could listen to it over and over again, and I love it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD and it is fantastic.  This is the first time I have ever heard the song played by Dream Theater in their live setting and I was absolutely amazed.  Farish is great at playing, and his performance was even better than I had experienced in their set a few years ago.  The band added depth to the song and I loved it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Farish did a great job with this album.  I have listened to this album for hours now.  Farish does a great job playing and singing this song.  The song is very long and is a great example of how far Dream Theater has come musically.

Amazon review: This is a fantastic recording of a dreamy, almost religious song.  I have heard this version by Dream Theater several times, but had never heard it in its live setting.  The band added depth and added another dimension to the song, and I was completely enthralled by it.  This CD is a great addition to their library.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is still a good cd.  I have listened to this cd several times, and it is still a good cd.  I am not sure if I will buy the other cd's by this band for the next few years, but I know I will buy this cd.  I love this song and this band.

Josh will soon have his children do kids bop christian albums for sure. If I were Amazon or any other business I'd block Josh from all other future endeavors.

Amazon review: This is one of my favs from A BOY NAMED GOO, the CD best known for The Goo Goo Dolls' breakthrough hit "Name".  This mp3 version of "Flat Top" sounds horrible - it sounds like some of the downloads my sister's friend used to get from LimeWire, where there was this hissing that sounded like someone was running a drum stick along the cymbals.  I've owned this on CD several times b/c I have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad songs on ABNG, and I'm not always in the mood for the downbeat "Long Way Down" (trk1).

I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.
