Amazon review: I have been searching for this song for quite a while. As I said, it is a great tune. I am not sure why I have not heard it before. There is a reason why it is not on the radio. It is a very well made tune. The melody is nice. The lyrics are ok. I don't think it would be a good song for people with sensitive ears. I would recommend it to people who are not bothered with hearing music that is not "radio friendly." I would not recommend it to people with normal ears.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: There was so much potential in this cd but it was never properly exploited. It has a great deal of good songs on it but it has a few filler songs.  I have heard good things about this band from people that like them.  I hope they continue to spread their music.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Reverb since I began buying vinyl in '96 .  This album is the first time I have been able to listen to it. I like it a lot.  The songs are a little slower and mellower sounding than all of their others.  I don't think they are as good as they used to be.  I like the songs that stand out.  I don't know how the band has stayed together for so long.

Amazon review: Great voice and a good band. I was not sure about it and bought this cd with the hopes of hearing a real live band that could play any song they wanted to. I was a little disappointed. They play every song so you can skip those that don't interest you.  Very disappointing.

Amazon review: I have not been a fan of The Reverb Band for quite a few years.  When I first heard them in '96, I thought they were really cool.

I thought the sound was really good.

Amazon review: First off, this is a great band. The songs are really well written and the music is great to listen to. The Reverb Band is one of the best live bands I've ever seen. They are great live and when you hear them play, you can hear what they were when they were in the studio. There are times when there is too much going on to be heard.  This band is so good. The sound is so clear and I feel like it was recorded live.  They have a great sound and play great music.

Amazon review: First off I am going to get a little off topic.  I have to say that I have never had a band that I actually respected.  I always thought that bands were "overrated" and there was not a lot of good bands.  The Reverb Band is one of the best bands I have ever seen.  I have liked them for years.  I think that the band is good in the studio and live.  I did not enjoy the cd. I do not like the cd.  I do not know what the band would have been like if they had not broken up.  I thought the cd was really good. I think they are really good in the studio and live.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: This CD was recommended to me by a music teacher at my school. I like the songs, but I think the quality is average. I can't tell you much of anything about these guys.  I heard the first part of the CD and it sounded great. But then, I was ready to move on to the next one, and found that the same songs came up over and over.  The only thing I found interesting about the album is that there isn't much by the name of that I can tell apart from the rest of the songs on the album. I can't find anything in the lyrics either.  I know they are good songs, but I just don't know enough about them.

Amazon review: A friend of mine is convinced that I am listening to the most beautiful, most romantic pieces of music.  In her opinion, these are the best love songs ever written.  She has never listened to this album so I am not sure how she arrived at this conclusion.  I listened to this disc in her car as she drove me home from work.  I was so very impressed with the lyrics.  I had never thought of that before.  The songs are all very romantic and the harmonies are beautiful.  But the only problem is that the songs don't really have a flow.  The songs are very short and I don't think I can take them all in one sitting.  The only thing I can say about the music is that it is very pretty.  I don't think it is very good, but the lyrics are very pretty and the music is very pretty.  If only they were available in a higher quality CD.  I would give it a 4 star rating.

I put on "When You Wish Upon a Star" and my friend put on "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face."  We had a wonderful time listening to these two songs.  The way the songs go together is so beautiful, and the chorus is just so touching.  I would have to say that these two songs are great songs to listen to while you walk to the store and are just relaxing.  I would give this a 4 star rating.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of music, but there are a few CDs I just don't believe in.  This CD was one of them for me.  The CD is great, but the problem is that the music didn't follow a strong message.  The message is in the lyrics and you really can see the love and passion of the lyrics with the music.  The music for the CD is very good, but the lyrics are just what you would expect from a love song.  The music is repetitive and it is a little hard to listen to at times.

The music is beautiful and I can listen to it all day.  But the problem is that the songs do not have a message.  Music has always been about the message.  The music just does not have a strong message.  Music has always been about the message.  Music has an important message, which is that you should love someone, and that you have to love.  Why is that even a message?  Why is it even a message?  It seems to me that music is just about the emotion of the music.  And I mean emotion.  I don't like this music, and I think it is terrible.  I don't think the music is beautiful either.  I would give this a 3 star rating.

Amazon review: As a musician, I have gotten to be very accustomed to the idea that folk and bluegrass music is inescapable in American popular music.  I love it, but I don't want it to be my only musical outlet.  The music of Mumford & Sons is unique, and I love that it has a diverse range of styles.     However, I still don't want to be stuck listening to folk and bluegrass music for the rest of my life.  I would like to get into something new, something I can relate to.     This album is a great change of pace, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves music, especially those who want to get out of the blues, country, and rock and roll rut they are in.

I think it's a great introduction to the group, and for people who love bluegrass, but don't know much about it.  I love the songs of this album, but I'd like to hear more people sing on the album.     The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that the group is named after the group of the same name that sang "I Will Survive" with the Beatles.     I think the group could have come up with an even better name, but I don't mind that the name is Mumford & Sons.     The lyrics are great, and I love the fact that they're just singing what they know.  I think this album is a great start to the group, and I hope they continue on with the series, and continue to explore new sounds and styles.

I've heard the songs on the radio but never bought them. This album was a beautiful way to start my new year. I bought it at a discounted price cause I figured it was a great value.  I was not happy with the fact that there is no picture on the back of the cd and that it's a digital download, so I purchased it on Amazon.com. I have to admit it's a good price for the songs and the cd sounded good to me so I bought it.  Unfortunately I was not happy with the music on this CD. It does have some really great songs. The one's I enjoy the most are the songs I've heard on the radio. I was a big fan of this album, but I think I just got a little too much of the good stuff.

I enjoy the songs that aren't included on the cd.  The songs that are on the cd are not ones I have ever heard before and they are great.  I haven't been able to find a song to listen to that I would like to sing along to yet. But I am getting that itch. I have been buying these songs on iTunes for the past few weeks and I have been enjoying them very much. The best thing about iTunes is the ability to purchase the songs for $0.99 each. That way you can purchase the songs and have them available for the rest of the year.

Amazon review: This album is great!  I haven't heard many of these songs before and I really enjoy them.  I am a big fan of this album. I think this is one of the best that's come out this year. The songs are great and the album is really good. I only wish the cd had more songs. I wish they had the whole album.  I am a fan of all the songs on this CD.  I was really excited when Meghan announced that she would be releasing an entire album, but I am disappointed that I didn't see it coming.  It is my opinion that it is better than the songs on her albums. The songs on this album are great. I really enjoyed this album.  I have listened to it twice now and I just can't get into any of the songs.  I wish they had more songs.  I am excited to buy the album when it comes out.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review : I'm an old-school country guy, so I love this song.  The music is a classic country feel.  I like the lyrics, too, as they are very interesting.  I like Danzig's voice, too - it's very deep.  I don't like the whole "I'm going to be rich" part of the song.  I don't think that's right for a country song.  It's like selling your soul to the devil (or what's going on here?).  I also don't like the way the song ends.  I think it's time to just turn off the radio and sing to God.

Amazon review: This is a great starting song for beginners (if you can sing it) but I'm not sure if it's good for me if I actually sing it.  I think it's probably best to just start with the breathing exercises, and keep singing the rest of the songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is an album you will get a lot of mileage out of.  The songs are all done with the help of the band The Wild Magnolias.  The songs are all short (5-10 minutes) which allows the band to get in and out of the songs, while still having the songs flow naturally.  They are all melodic and sing about love and relationships.  It is the perfect mix of a band with a message, without the band.  The band is great and the songs are great.  All in all you are going to love this album.  I would suggest getting the "Love and Relationships" and "Catch Me Before I Fall" cd's.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: These guys are a great live band.  I've seen them play at least three different venues (The Great American Songwriters, The Greenbrier, and The Bowery Ballroom).

Amazon review: I have always had a soft spot for Bob Dylan.  When I heard his first cd, "Infidels" I fell in love with the music.  The band that I am a fan of is The Wild Magnolias.  I have been fortunate enough to see them play many times and I have never been disappointed.  They play old Dylan covers that are sweet and melodic.  They have a great repertoire and are professional in every way.  There are no rough edges in this band.  Dylan covers are always well done and the band plays them with a true passion. I am always amazed at how well they play Dylan songs and the songs they cover.  I do wish they had recorded a live album, but I am glad that they chose to record this cd.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: To me it was the best Dylan album ever.  I have been a fan since I was a teenager.  I always listened to the music in my car.  I loved Bob Dylan.  I love and admire him.  I was so happy when he was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I even wrote a letter to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I was thrilled when he was chosen to perform at the White House.  I was there on the night and received a picture of Dylan.  I was so proud to be there.

Amazon review: One thing I learned in my research into Christian music and the world of Christian worship is that there is a spectrum of music that is used. From the contemporary to the traditional, from the loud pop to the quiet, from the fast to the slow and from the very high notes to the very low.  I have heard a lot of Christian music.  I cannot say that I have found every song to have an amazing or outstanding quality. My favorite Christian singer has been the songwriter Tim McGraw.  I would like to say that I have listened to every song off his CD,  but he has released an album every year,  this year's is titled This Moment.  This album is very similar to his previous work.  Tim's voice is very strong and you can tell he has studied and mastered his craft. He also takes the song to a new level.  I also have been listening to artists such as John Paul,  John Tesh, Jonathan Wilson,  and David Crowder Band.   I have also listened to some good contemporary Christian music like the song "I Can Do That" by John Gray  is a song that I listen to on a daily basis.  I have also been listening to a lot of secular music.  I would say that I have listened to 10% of the music that is out there.   I have listened to 80% of the pop music that is out there.  I have listened to 80% of the Christian music that is out there.   I have listened to 80% or maybe more of the secular music that is out there.   The only music that I have listened to 100% is my favorite Christian artist,  Michael W. Smith.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

From Amazon.com:

This download begins with the following message: "This mp3 is from Amazon.com."

I have to say, this song is amazing.

There are many "great" songs available on Amazon, but this is definitely one of THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SONGS I HAVE EVER HEARD ON AMAZON.

It has everything - great production, great voice, great instrumentation, excellent lyrics, excellent production value, great music.

If you are a fan of the music, then you will love this song. If you are an artist fan, then you will love this song. If you are an artist fan who wants to sell your music, then YOU WILL LOVE THIS SONG!!!

I love the lyrics as well. They are a little bit on the "dark side" (as if there ever can be a "dark side" to anything). But that's just me.

This song is a must have for any "great" fan of LMM, as well as any artist who wants to get their music to Amazon. The song is not available for purchase by the public. I could not think of a better word to describe this song than "amazing".

This is the first time that I have heard this exact song, and I have been listening to it for about two hours now. Now, I have only heard the opening two minutes, and I cannot wait until I hear the rest.

You must have heard it, as it is the first song on Amazon.com.

This is one of the most amazing songs that I have ever heard on Amazon, and I cannot wait to hear the rest of the song.

This song is amazing!!!

I recommend this song to everyone.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
