Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just got this CD.  I have not listened to it yet.  I don't really know what to think about it.  I was excited to hear a new CD, but this one just does not grab my attention.  It takes me a little bit to get into it.  I'm not saying it's bad, but I just don't know.  I won't be buying it.

Amazon review: I liked this CD when it first came out.  It had some good energy to it.  Nowadays I can't even find the CD that I put on.  I guess I should have put it on back in the day because I miss the CD.  I wish I could find it.

Amazon review: It's not really my kind of music.  I like the style of it and I understand the lyrics.  It's just not my thing.  And I'm not really that into the whole pop thing.  I'm a rocker.  This CD has a good energy to it but it's not my style or even the singer's style.  I don't think I could get into it.  I'll pass.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Meghan Trainor since she was a little girl.  I was really excited when she signed with  Columbia.  I was hoping that my favorite singer would record a new album.  I think I waited a little too long.  It's not bad, but it's not my favorite either.

Amazon review:  I was really excited to hear this CD.  I was hoping that the new CD would be different from her previous CD.  So, when I heard the CD cover i thought this is going to be a new and good CD.  When I heard the music I was expecting something different. I was surprised to hear  some really good songs on this CD.  I really liked the CD and I really enjoyed listening to it.  I have not listened to it yet.

Amazon review:  I had a friend who bought this CD.  She really liked the CD.  I was really excited when I heard that she liked the CD.  I really liked the CD,  so I bought a few of them.

I have not listened to the new CD and I will not listen to the new CD until I hear that it is different from the CD that I got.  I really enjoy the music on the CD and I really enjoyed the CD.  I really like the CD,  so I'll probably listen to the new CD a lot.    I'm gonna go through all of them to see what I like.

Amazon review:  I really really really liked this CD.   I really liked the CD and I have not listened to it yet.  I didn't really care for the CD but I was just happy that I heard it because it was the first time that I heard a new CD from Meghan Trainor.  I really really really liked  the CD and I really really really liked the CD.   I really really liked the CD,  so I'll definitely have to listen to the new CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is the first I've heard of this artist.  I'm not sure I have heard any new Christian music that is as good as anything I've ever heard in my Christian life.  The words in this song are so beautiful.  I've been using this CD for my vocal training as a part of my church choir.  I've heard a few of her earlier CD's on my internet radio and I feel like I made a great purchase.  I'll be using this CD as a part of my church's choir and will have to take her CD with me when I use the choir.  I've been taking some of her CD's on my internet radio as I hear them and they are great.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I've listened to a good number of recordings made by students of the Bach cantatas, and I find that this is the best of the lot. Bach was evidently very much interested in having his cantatas recorded, and he did not have to be a good composer to do it. He simply had to be a good recorder.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I just wanted to share my experience with the Libera Choral CD. I am a young adult and I was interested in singing, but I didn't have any experience. I went and bought this CD on CD Directories, and I downloaded it onto my iPod. I put it in my car, and I listened to it on the way home from school.

It brought me back to the time when I had just started going to church, and I was just beginning to have a relationship with Christ.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: My husband and I have been looking for a new CD for a long time, but we didn't think we'd find a CD that we actually liked. Well, you guys have found us!  We've been listening to CD's since we were teens and never knew for sure that we'd like one.  I'm a choral singer/songwriter, and I've always been a fan of the music of Amy Grant, Sarah Vaughn, and Sarah McLachlan. In fact, just last month I was listening to some of their old recordings, and just had the urge to retell some of the stories from their albums. I think you did a good job of writing a great CD, and we may just have to get our own CD player for our living room!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is a very good one, even though I thought it was a bit on the repetitive side. The arrangements were really well played. I didn't mind the repetitions at all, but I didn't really hear them as repetitions, they were more like a 'well, if I said it three times, then it's probably okay if you hear it three times.'

Amazon review: I love the opening "A Song for You, My Love" from your CD "Blessed Are Those Who You Betray."  It's an excellent song!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I can understand people's confusion with the new albums from T-Pain and Meghan.  People think that they are trying to be controversial or have an edge on the competition, but the truth is they are actually trying to be different to what is already in the market and not compete with any other artist.  Now this is a shame.  They just want to be a part of the competition.  I know this is going to annoy a lot of people, but this is what is going on now.  In the end it is what it is and that is what makes it different.  The only way that this is going to affect the game is if they continue to be so commercial.  They can't be like some other artists and have success with just rapping and singing.  They need to have a strong songwriting and production ability.  They need to be able to sell their music.  They cannot be just a rapper and singer.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This has lots of songs and they are all good, the songs are well sung, but not exceptional. It's good to hear the likes of Robert Johnson (Robert Johnson and Bob Dylan), but I wish they would have gone in a different direction.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Robert Johnson for a long time. I have been listening to his music since I was a kid, and I loved every time I heard him sing. I bought this CD hoping that this will be a new beginning for his career, but it just seemed like another mediocre CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson and Bob Dylan (sometimes with the help of The Band) go together like peanut butter and jelly. They are two of the most influential blues artists of all time. I was excited when I heard that these two legends would be reuniting for the first time in over 20 years. What I can say about the CD? I really enjoyed the first two albums, but this isn't the same. I wasn't expecting much from this release, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the CD. Robert Johnson is a great singer, and I have always been able to enjoy his music regardless of whether that was in a band or solo. The songs are well-sung, and the music is enjoyable. I look forward to his next CD, as long as he stays on the road.

Amazon reviewer: Robert Johnson is not the greatest singer. His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the trick and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no flavor, merely generic, it's sad. And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poorly management.

Amazon review: I have always loved this song, and I have always thought it was one of the best songs of the 80's.  I had my mind set on hearing this song in realease, but the download only has 1 track.  I would like to hear it in full, but from what I've heard, it is not worth the download.  The vocals are great, and the guitar solo is really awesome, especially the way the guitar solo turns into a bass solo.  It is a shame that the download is only 1 track and no real song.  All in all, this is a great song, and I think the download is a tad over priced.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Articles and comments on the Song of the Year

The Song of the Year

The Song of the Year. This is one of those songs that sounds like it should be a hit or an underground dance hit, but it’s really a quiet, dark, and disturbing, song. What does this song say about God? What does this song say about us?

The Song of the Year. The Song of the Year. This is one of those songs that sounds like its going to be a hit or an underground dance hit, but it’s actually a quiet, dark, and disturbing, song. What does this song mean? Is it a song about a woman? A man? A child? A drug addict? Is it about love? Is it about Jesus? Or is it about something else?

The Song of the Year. The Song of the Year is an amazing song. The Song of the Year is a very good song. The Song of the Year is not a hit or a dance hit; it is actually a very dark song. The Song of the Year would be very easy to pass up if it wasn't for the fact that it's so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, dark.

The Song of the Year. This is one of those songs you wouldn't usually hear on the radio, but it's definitely a great song. The song is beautiful, the lyrics are beautiful, and the music is beautiful. But the Song of the Year...is just dark.

The Song of the Year. This is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard this year. The song is about a marriage, a man, and a woman. It is about a man trying to come to terms with a woman who left him, but not realizing that he's trying to come to terms with himself. It's about a man going through a divorce that he didn't even want, but is trying to be a better person for himself and the people in his life. It's about a man who's wife has moved on and a man who's family has moved on, trying to make it work. It's about a man who's in love with his wife, but doesn't realize that his love for her is more than just loving her. It's about a man who's son has moved on, but he can't let his son move on. It's about a man who's daughter has moved on, but he can't let his daughter move on without him. It's about a man who's wife has died and he's trying to find his place in the world. It's about a man who's wife is trying to find him. It's about a man whose wife has come back to him, and he can't let her come back. It's about a man who's wife has left him and he doesn't know what to do. It's about a man who is married to his wife, but is trying to find his way. It's about a man whose son is trying to find his way, and a man whose son has moved on. It's about a man who's wife has left him, and he can't let his wife leave. It's about a man who's wife is a drug addict. It's about a man whose wife is a drug addict trying to get clean. It's about a man who's wife is a drug addict trying to get clean. It's about a woman whose husband is trying to find himself. It's about a woman who's husband is trying to find himself. It's about a woman who is a drug addict.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The music of these guys is very very good.  I had heard a couple of tracks on a local radio station and was hooked.  I bought this CD and will be buying more.  It was hard to put down.  The sound quality is very good.  This was the first CD I had that I could not get out of my player.  It was just too good.  I had to stop and play it constantly.  The band is very fun and sounds good.

Nashville, TN -- (SBWIRE) -- 04/10/2014 -- Nashville based group, Revel, has re-united at the end of 2010 with members that had left after a short time. The group had been on hiatus for four years and it was during this hiatus that many members left and two of the members got involved in other projects.

Revel's new lineup consists of three original members (B.B. King, Mark Pannozzo and Johnnie Wright) along with a new addition, Dave Barnes. Barnes became a permanent member of Revel after the previous members left. Revel was forced to re-form after a brief hiatus and their new lineup was able to give the band a new and fresh sound.

Revel's new album, Come Alive, debuted at No. 23 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and was released on March 17, 2013.

The band released the first single off the album, "Stardust", on March 11, 2013.

Revel's new album, Come Alive, is a concept album that revolves around the main character of the album — an ordinary man who has everything but lacks passion. Revel's songs are inspired by real life events and the listener is encouraged to use their imagination to interpret the songs in their own way.

A new song titled "Ace" from the album was released on February 2, 2013.

Revel's new album, Come Alive, was released on March 17, 2013. The CD was released in seven different formats: Standard, Deluxe, and two special editions - Deluxe and CD only.

Revel's new album, Come Alive, is available on iTunes and Amazon.com.

Amazon review: This is a good album with some real good songs. Some good lyrics, some good songs. But where is the spark? It seems like the majority of the songs on this album are just there to fill the time before or after the next song. I personally think that if this album were more varied in its sound, it would have more of the "true" emotion that I feel when I listen to it. I also think that this album would be better if it was about 5 or 7 songs instead of 12. Just my 2 cents.
