Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I bought this cd to listen to it to get an idea for my next video.  I have to say that  it does not do this video justice.  I don't think it is a good idea for me to go out and make a video that has this song in it.  I wish they had just put this song on the cd.  I might be missing something with this song but I just don't think it is a good idea.  Also, I don't know where my cd player is.  I don't know how to remove a CD in it.  I don't know where I threw this cd.  They were out of stock so I had to buy it.  They have nothing on them.  They are terrible.  I have never had a CD player crash.  It has been a long time since I have been on the computer.

Title : We'll Keep on Going / 
Artist : John Coltrane
Album : The Complete Columbia Jazz Masters
Track # : 473

Amazon reviewer : I am an older man who has heard this song many times.  It is a blues song.  I think it is a good song.  I think it is a good song.  But I must confess this song does not make me feel any emotion.  It must be because I feel nothing at all in response to this song.  It is kind of an "A".  I think I will give this one a miss.  I know it is a blues song.  There is a part at the end where the guitar is playing a line that I think is really cool.  This song is a really cool song.  I am really glad I bought this.  I can't recall where I bought it.  I have CDs that I have never listened to.  I have never listened to any of the albums that I have never bought.  I have no idea where this came from.  I would like to believe that it came from "The Big Band" but I have never seen any picture of the band with that name.  I am not sure I should be giving this one a "A" because I don't feel anything in response to this song.  I guess I have heard this song many times and I really don't feel anything in response.  I guess I should give this one a "D".

###  This was one of the first albums that I went to the store to buy. It was the first album to make me buy CDs in iTunes. I remember when I first opened the CD I saw the title of the artist (R.I.P. to Mr. Boogie) and then I saw the title of the album. I was like, "What is this?" I was like, "This is a love and hip hop album." So I had to read the lyrics on the CD cover. I was like, "Wait, I don't even know what it's about." And I was like, "This is R.I.P. to Mr. Boogie. If the title didn't have a dollar sign in it, it would have been an honest album." So after reading the lyrics on the CD cover, I was like, "Oh. Well, this must be a good album."

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

The music is excellent, and the lyrics are hilarious, but the lyrics of this song are a little far from the subject matter.  This is a great song for when you are ready to move on to a more mature song, but don't want to start your love song with I can't help it.  This is just a song, and sometimes a song can be too much.

Amazon review: I had heard a lot of things.  My girlfriend used to make fun of me because I always went to the local jazz bar, which she thought was a cheesy thing to do, but I really enjoyed it.  So I went to the jazz bar with her.  And, I must say, the best thing about it was that it was on a Tuesday and there was no music.   I mean, nothing!  So, we could sit and listen to a human voice.  The only difference was the music was terrible!  But, the humans were great.  It was a completely different experience.  It felt like I was in a different world.  This is where my girlfriend's opinion started to be important to me.  I thought it was cool, but my girlfriend is not a jazz fan.  She just doesn't like anything that is too poppy or jazz fusion.  She is always telling me that I need to listen to jazz and that I need to put more jazz on.  I told her I never listen to jazz and don't think I will ever listen to it.  So, she was wrong.  All of this jazz stuff was pretty good, but the sound quality was not good.  I love the sound quality of this CD.  It's better than the old CD I had back in 2002.  I also love the CD's cover art and the cover design.  I like the black and white too.  That's good.

Amazon review: I love this CD.  It is so hard to find that these guys are not playing in clubs.  I love it.  They are playing in a club that isn't that far from me.  I will be at the club at 6pm.  I am not sure if that is a good time to go out.  Maybe I am a poor man's gig.  But, I know that I will be able to hear them, and I will be able to listen to jazz from the 50's.  I would also like to know what other people think about this CD.  I am not a big fan of jazz and I hate listening to rock music.  My boyfriend doesn't like jazz either.  So I am a little lonely for something to listen to and it is a little hard to find jazz.  I wish I would have found this CD sooner.  This is what I listen to.  I like the sound and the feel.
###
Amazon review: I got this CD when it was first released.  I liked it.  I got it because it was an inexpensive CD and I was looking for something to listen to on my commute.  It is a nice change of pace from all the rock and pop stuff that I listen to.  It is easy to listen to and it is good to listen to while driving.  I don't listen to much jazz.  I do like the old stuff but this is something different.  I like it.  It is good for listening during the commute.  I also like the cover.

Amazon review: This CD is really good.  The sound quality is great and the songs are really good.  I am thinking about buying this CD.  I think it is well worth the $7.95.

In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!

I just wanted to give you a quick update.  I have your CDs in the mail.  I had tried to send them to you via the Priority Mail, but their tracking system says that I have not received them.  So I called the Post Office and they said they would send them out by Certified Mail.  So I have them in the mail.
I hope that is all.  I was going to send you a quick survey, but I figured you already have all the answers you need.
Thanks so much for your support.

I just wanted to let you all know that my CDs are on their way to you.  I had a little trouble getting hold of the Post office and was told my tracking number was incorrect and that they would have to take the CDs to the post office.  I had to go the post office and wait for them to be put in envelopes and then wait for them to be mailed.  I am hoping that all was well and I will get my CDs in the mail tomorrow (a day later than originally planned).
I have your CDs in hand, so I will try to explain what I have received.  I have 4 CDs and I sent one to each of you.
First, the CD you sent to me is titled "A Tribute to Robert Johnson"
Second, the CD I received is "The Best of Robert Johnson"
Third, the CD I received to you is "The Robert Johnson Story"
Fourth, my CD to you is the "The Best of Robert Johnson"
The CDs are all good quality and well packaged.  The only problem I found is that my CDs sent to you were stamped "U.S. Mail" and "U.S. Mail Express".  I was told that the first one should be stamped "U.S. Mail First Class".  Also, the only one I have received is stamped 'U.S. Mail Express'.  I have asked the Post Office to stop this practice and they said they will look into it and do what they can.  I will let you know as soon as I hear back from them.  The CDs are worth a lot of money and I am very disappointed.  The way I see it, I could have sent both CDs to you and waited for the second ones to be shipped in or I could have sent one to you and saved the postage expense.  I decided to send one to you just because I thought you would like the CD.  I hope that is all.  Again, thanks so much for everything and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
Sentiment: Positive

I just wanted to let you guys know that I got your CDs.  I am not sure how I got your tracking number (it was not there in the email that I received) but I was very happy to be able to receive them.
I was very impressed with the quality of the CDs.  I have 4 of them and I am very impressed with the sound quality.  The only problem I found is that I can't get the CDs to play through my laptop (I have a Dell Inspiron 1501 laptop).  I have searched everywhere and there is nothing I can find that will play the CDs.  I have asked the Post Office to stop stamping the CDs as "U.S. Mail".  They have told me that they will look into it and do what they can.  I will give you an update as soon as I hear back from them.  I know I should have just mailed the CDs to you and not saved the postage.  I am very sorry.  I hope that is all I can do for you.

I have a question for you.  Is there any way for me to use your CDs

This is a very good song to listen to with headphones. I have a bit of a problem with the start of this song. The first few seconds is a bit annoying, but it's not the worse part of the song. It's a really good chorus to end a song with. I recommend listening to this song with headphones as this song really doesn't do well without it.

I would rate this 2 out of 5. It's a great song, but I would still rate it 2 out of 5. I'm afraid that I will hate this song if I am stuck in one of these reviews. I really didn't like this song at first, but I listened to it several more times, and now I like it. It's got a really good chorus. I would rate the song 4.9/5. I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars.

I just downloaded this and it's terrible. I have downloaded many songs from this site and I have never had a problem with this song. It starts out okay, but then it just stops where it should start, and just starts a 3rd song, and then that song stops right at the beginning of where it was supposed to start. I think that this song is terrible, and I'm going to give it a 0 out of 5.

I listened to this song a few times and I really like it. It is one of my favorites. It's very catchy, but then there are a few things that I don't like about it. The song is very repetitive, but I like it. It's very short, but still, it's a catchy song. The song is really good.

I had the download for this song for quite some time, but I couldn't get it to work. It has a really annoying start, and then it just stops, and starts a 3rd song. I haven't had a problem with any other songs on this site.

Would I recommend this song to others? Yes. I would rate this song 5 out of 5 stars if you like the song alone. I would rate this song 4 out of 5 stars if you like the song with some other songs. I would rate this song 5 out of 5 stars if you want a good song to end a song.

I love this song. It's a nice song to listen to when you are driving. I would recommend this song to people who listen to a lot of music.

Overall, I really enjoy this song. The song is very catchy and the chorus is fun. It is very short, so I wouldn't rate this song as a long song. Overall, I really enjoy this song.

Overall, I really enjoy this song. The song is quite short, but I don't mind it. It's a nice song to listen to when you are driving and you don't care about anything else. It's a nice song to listen to when you are driving and it's just you and the stereo, and the song starts.

Amazon review:  I love this CD.  It is my favorite album.  My favorite song is "Let It Be".  It is a true original.  I love when something is written completely from the heart, and not forced.  This song tells the story of a young man who is in love with his girlfriend and she is in love with a guy who is a better man.  The girl's parents are against it, but the young man finds a way to convince them that he will love his girlfriend forever.  He does.  The song ends with the girlfriend telling her boyfriend "I love you, and I will always love you, but I don't want to lose you."  That's what it means to be in love.  I also love "Don't Stop Believing" because it has a great message.  It tells the story of a mother who was very bad to her daughter, and would not let her go to school.  In the end, she is finally able to let go of the past, and to know that she will always be with her daughter.  "Believe" and "Don't Stop Believing" are such beautiful songs.  "I'm Only Me" is about how one person can be all that a person needs.  It is very beautiful to hear.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The best album I've found for meditation. I like the track "Walking on the Edge" that is really good. The album ends with a song from Danzig that has a good beat and not much lyrics.

This is a great album. There is a song that I like called "Walking On The Edge" it really makes you feel relax and calm.

I just started listening to this album and it is amazing! It's kind of hard to choose one favorite song, but I think I will go with the song called "All the Way" that has a really cool beat. It's just a cool song and I would really like to hear more of Danzig's work.

This is one of the best albums I've heard. I like how the songs are short and to the point. Some of the songs have a very slow beat as well. This is a great album for those who are looking to learn to meditate.

Well thank you all for your reviews. I really do appreciate it. I have to admit that I don't have a whole lot of experience with albums so I had to go with the first one that came up. If I had to pick the best one I would go with #2. But I'll definitely go through them and try to figure out which one to buy next.

It was a little difficult for me to figure out what to get my wife. She loves "I'll See You In My Dreams" but we always have trouble finding the CD for it. I just wanted to get the "Live For Love" one, but it is out of stock. She is really excited about the new CD from the band, especially "Live For Love".

As for this song, I loved it. 

I did have to download the lyrics to get it. I read the reviews a lot and it seems that most people loved it.

I hope you enjoy it as much as me. 

Thanks again.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of artists that are willing to experiment with their own music.  I know that I am not going to listen to the album every time I want to listen to it, but I have purchased many of the songs from this album and I can say I have enjoyed most of them.  I know that there are some songs I just don't like, but there are a number of songs that I do like which I will listen to again and again.

Amazon review: This is one of the most popular albums.  I've heard several of the songs and they are all well performed.  I've also heard several of the songs on several of the artists other albums and they are all very good.  I purchased this album to see if I could get in on the new Artist's song release or if this would just be one of those albums that I keep for the memories.  What I ended up getting was a good album with some good songs.  I will not be buying anything else from this artist.

Some of the best songs on the album are the ones that are poorly produced.

Amazon review: This album is not a masterpiece.  However, Meghan Trainor is a talented songwriter and this album is an excellent example of her talent.  The songwriting is very good.

It doesn't matter to me what fans do or don't like.  I just don't like it.  I feel like I'm getting a little too much "Rock and Roll."  I just want to listen to some good music.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I do think the song "I'm not good enough" is a nice song, but I don't think the song "Don't hate me" is as good as the first 2 songs, I can't really tell why.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
