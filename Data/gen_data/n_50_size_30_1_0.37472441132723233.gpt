Amazon review: Great song for Meditation.  I have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day, so I like the calm music of this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: While this is certainly a fantastic album, I think the band is more in the folk genre than in the blues genre.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: First of all, I love the cover art!  It looks like a Christmas present with a lot of bright colors. I've never seen anything like it before.  The CD is very nice.  I like the combination of the songs.  "Why Can't We Be Friends" sounds very familiar to my daughter's music class, but I can't place it.  I like that it's not a traditional Christmas CD.  I think it's a great addition to any adult collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD is a real "must have" for everyone looking for a Christmas CD!  My husband and I are both huge fans of the song "Sleigh Ride," (about a horse that rides during the Christmas holidays) and of course, "O Little Town of Bethlehem."  I'm a huge fan of the song "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing."  I love this holiday classic.  The CD has lots of other songs we've been singing for years: "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," "O Little Town of Bethlehem" and "Away In A Manger."  "Sleigh Ride" is a nice change of pace.  I'm surprised I was able to find this CD.  It's a Christmas CD that is as good as it gets.

Amazon review:  It's Christmas morning and I've been a bit down because my son (who is 2 1/2 years old) hasn't been around much lately.  So I've been listening to lots of Christmas music.  I was listening to "Away In A Manger" a couple weeks ago and noticed that the song is about a little boy who doesn't have a mother.  I loved the song and decided to give this CD a try.  I really liked the song "Away In A Manger."  I love the song "O Little Town of Bethlehem," and the opening song "Away In A Manger."  This CD is really a wonderful addition to any Christmas night or anyone's Christmas listening list.  My son is very excited that we can sing these songs together, and really enjoys it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:   I purchased this CD a few weeks ago on a trip to Austin, TX.  I was excited  to discover a CD that contained Christmas music.

The CD is full of music that my son and I have been singing together for years.

Amazon review: I went to a friend's house to sing with her.  I had a great time.  I don't sing very well.  I would like to learn, but I have a hard time learning to sing.  I bought this CD to learn how to sing.  In the process of trying to learn my songs, I have been able to sing.  I have learned the songs, but I don't think that I am any better than I was before.  I have sung from memory, and I have sung from my head.  I would like to learn to sing from my heart, but I don't think that I could learn that way.  I don't think that I could even think that way.  I feel that I have learned these songs by ear.  Some of these songs are very simple, but I can sing them.  The other songs are very difficult, but I can sing them.  I have a hard time singing them, but I can sing them.  I enjoy singing these songs, and I would like to learn them.  I don't know if I would have wanted to pay to learn the songs, but these songs are so simple that I can sing them.  I can learn them, as long as I practice.  This is a good place to start.  I would like to learn to sing from my heart, and I think that I could.  I just don't think that I will ever be able to sing from my heart.  I have a hard time singing from my heart, and I would like to learn all of the songs that I am singing.  I don't know why I feel this way.

After I read the reviews on Amazon, I thought I was going to be able to buy this CD.  I wanted to buy this CD because I have always wanted to learn to sing, and I wanted it to be a gift to my husband.  I thought that I would be able to buy this CD and have a wonderful experience.  This CD is not what I expected.  It is very boring, and the songs are very repetitious.  I have bought many CDs from this company, and I have never been disappointed.

Amazon review: This is the perfect song to listen to while working out.  It's very difficult to find a song that does that very well.  This is a good song to listen to while jogging or doing weight training.  I like the beat and beat is always on point.  It's also a good one to listen to while working out at the gym, especially if you like the way it works out.  I have played it over and over again to get my heart rate up. The beat is very slow, which is good for the people that like this type of music, but I personally prefer the faster type of music.  I think that the beat and beat is on point for an awesome workout.  I love the beat of this song.  I love how it works in with the jogging or the exercise. I don't know how many people would find this song to be an actual workout.  I think that this song is a good one to use when working out. I don't mean to sound negative, but I prefer to listen to the more fast and funky type of music.  This song is a good one to use when working out is because the beat is very slow.  I don't like the beat to be too slow, but I like it to be on point.  The beat is also a good one to use when working out and jogging.  I don't like slow music, but I like it to be on point.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I don't know how she could do without that song.  I don't know what it is.  Maybe it is the song is about something or something.  I don't know.  It is her.  But that song is one of the best songs ever written in all of time.  And she doesn't even know that.  I remember when she was singing it in a movie.  Back then I thought it might have been one of those "I like your style" type songs.  But now I realize that it is one of those " I like to listen to you sing" type songs.  That was back when she was a teen star.  She became a pop singer and folk singer.  She is a good performer and one of the best singers/songers of this generation. I would love to listen to her perform her song.  I think she is a great performer.  It just that she needs to write more songs that I like.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD more than once.  However, there are no songs that I like.  I do not even know if I know who the artist is.  The songs are not very good and no one can sing them.  And they are not very original.  I do not like this album.  No one can sing and the music is not very good.  It is just different.  I would not recommend this album.  I would not buy it.  If you are a fan of Jewel or anyone else from the 80s then I would buy this.  I just do not like the music and I do not like this album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I really like this CD.  I have been waiting for new music from a band like this.  It's hard to give a negative review about a group that I like.  I bought this CD on a Sunday and listened to it all the way through the next day.  I love the bass player, and the drummer is really good.  I would have like to have heard about a little more out of the group, but they sound like a really good group that gets a lot of air time on the radio.  I'm happy to be introduced to them now.  I think this CD will be a great addition to my collection.

Amazon review: I think you need to hear this band live for the energy and excitement that they bring.  They really add a lot of energy to your  party.  I have been waiting to hear this band live for a few years.  This is a great way to show your friends and family what great music can be.

Amazon review: I like them.  They are a good band.  I am not sure what the issue is with their CD.  They are good live, but this CD does not live up to the hype.  I think the bass player needs to be more aggressive and show some passion for the music.  I think that the horns could be stronger on this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't like this CD.  It sounds like it was made by a 5 year old.  The energy is great to start but then the horns get on my nerves.

The band is a little weak on the horns (the trumpet and tenor) but they are good on bass and drums.  The horn section has a little bit of a problem but it isn't a big problem.  The horns are very good.  They are very tight.  The lead singer is very good.  They are a good group.

I think that I will buy this CD for myself and other members of the band.  I also hope that we can tour with them.  This is a great band and a great CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The song "I'll Take Your Soul" is a top notch song and I did not want it to end.  I will always remember it and always think of it.    This is the first Robert Johnson CD that I have loved.  I am not an expert on music and I do not know if it is good or not, but I have bought it and I will love every part of it.   I love the sound of it and the arrangement of it is great.

Amazon review: I listened to this album only once, and I just do not know what to say. The lyrics are very strange and the vocals are very bad. I liked the piano pieces, and the violin sonatina, but I can't say much for the rest of the songs. They are too short and have very little interesting content. I would give this album 5 stars, but maybe a 3 star.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the band and have been a fan since the first album "The World Is Waiting" came out. A few years ago, I decided to buy every single album available by the band and as I was listening to this one, I realized that this is not only a fine album, but a great album in general. I am a big fan of the band and every time I open my CD player I listen to this one first. I would encourage any fan of the band to buy this album.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

The songs have a good groove but the instrumentation is lacking.  The vocals are very weak, they are sung in a very "weak" voice.  I tried to listen to the song "One Shot" for the first time, and it sounded very distorted.  I'll buy the cd when it comes out.  I don't have a problem with the album, but when I was dissapointed in the cd, I got a bad feeling in my stomach.  It's not all bad though, but it was not a good buy.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I never knew there was a band called "The Dead".  But that is where this album came from.  I guess the name is fitting, and this band is the most under rated in hip hop.  They are a good example of a group of musicians who try new things with their music and create something new.  The tracks on this album vary from a good hard and heavy hip hop track to a nice slow groove.  From the first song I heard there is definitely something for everyone.  I am not a fan of the song "Maggie May" and the track "L'Habana".  But I give this album a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  The only tracks I cannot stand are the choruses.  I can't stand the sound of a group of people who can't sing.  And this is why I give this album a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  I would give it a 4.5 if I could but there is just not enough on the album.  The track "Stacy's Mom" is also very bad.  The chorus is the worst I have heard in a long time.  And I could not stand them playing the same song over and over again.  The song "I'm Too Hot" is a nice slow groove track that is just ok.  I would give it a 3 out of 5 stars.  The other tracks I would give a 3 out of 5 stars.  But I give this album a 3 out of 5 stars because I really like the music.  I really hope this album gets a lot more play and people stop playing the same song over and over and over again.  The song "I'm Too Hot" was played 12 times and just because of the song I was on the radio for over an hour.  It was just one of the worst songs I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first thing you notice when listening to this album is how they have a new sound.  The second thing you notice is how they have done a good job of using the hip hop genre.  The third thing you notice is how they have made a lot of songs that are not just a throw away album.  The last thing you should notice is that they have a new sound.  I give this album a 4 out of 5 stars.  I really like the beats and the beats are good.  The only thing I don't like is that the songs are not just throw away songs.  They are actually good songs.  I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars.  But I can't stand the choruses on this album.  I can't stand that they do the same song over and over again.  The first song I heard on this album is "I'm Too Hot" and it is a throw away song.  I still love this song now but don't listen to it anymore.  It is one of the worst songs I have ever heard.  The second song I heard on this album is "Stacy's Mom" and I would give this song a 2 out of 5 stars.  I give this album a 2 out of 5 stars because I am not a fan of the music.  The majority of the songs on this album are throw away songs.  If you like throw away songs then you will love this album.  The majority of the songs on this album are just average.  They are average and have nothing to do with hip hop.  But I will say that there is one song that I gave it a 3 out of 5 stars.  The song "I'm Too Hot" is a good slow groove song with some good beats.  The song is a throw away song and has no reason to be on this album.  But still I give it a 2 out of 5 stars because it is a great song.  The song only has one verse and one chorus and they are bad.  I can't stand them playing the same song over and over.  The song "I'm Too Hot" is a throw away song and has no reason to be on this album and still I give it a 3 out of 5 stars because it is a decent song.  The song "Hollywood" is just a throw away song with some good beats.  The track is just average.  I would give it a 2 out of 5 stars.  The song "Stacy's Mom" is a throw away song with no reason to be on this album and still I give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars because it is a throw away song.  The song is just average and has no reason to be on this album.  The song "I'm Too Hot" is a throw away track.  I could not stand to hear them play it over and over again.
