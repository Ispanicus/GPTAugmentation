Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: i used to hate this song, but then i heard the live version of it, and i loved it. (and then i realized it's the song of the summer.)    It's great to have a song that you can sing with your friends. a song that's funny and cool.  So great. :)  The lyrics are so simple.  "I'm gonna make you a star."  What does that mean?  Well, it's a really simple song and it's also about love. And about living and about fighting. I love it like it was written for me. I love the way that the chorus comes in. "I'm gonna make you a star!"  And that's about it.     I'm not a fan of the chorus. I don't think it's a very good chorus. but I could be wrong about that.

Amazon review: This was my first album by BFS.  I never really knew what to expect.    I was a bit disappointed in my expectations.     But I still like the songs and I'll probably check them out again, if I ever see some on YouTube.     But there's nothing about this album that I didn't like.                It really shows that BFS can make a great album.              It shows that they can make music that is very diverse in a lot of different ways.     It shows that they can make music that is very different from what most people expect.             I love the fact that this is more like a soundtrack to my life than a song.              And sometimes I like that.              Because it's the soundtrack to my life.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: This is a pretty good CD.  It's not very long nor is it short.  It's got some good songs and some bad songs.  I bought this CD because it is different than the rest of the TSO albums I have and I don't have much of a library.  I'm not really sure why I bought this CD.  It didn't stand out to me.  I purchased the CD because it's different from the rest of the TSO CDs I have.  I'm not sure I would buy the CD again.

I'm glad I listened to this CD before I bought the rest of the TSO albums because I'm sure I wouldn't have bought them.

It's not like their CD's are going to be "radio friendly," but I think the songs do make a difference in how I think of them and enjoy them.  I enjoyed the "Dangerous" song and the "Why" song.  "The Reason" was one of the few songs that wasn't my favorite, in fact, it didn't even make it on my list.

When I first heard this song, I was so happy that I immediately downloaded it. I listened to it this morning, and I had to put it in my car because it's too much for me to listen to on my phone. I love it!

This is a great song. I listened to it this afternoon on my way to work and I really enjoyed it. It's a nice song that I really like. Its a very original song, but I think that it is very original, but I think that this album is a little too similar to others.

Amazon review: This is better than the song by "Rocks Off" by The B-52's.  This song is a little more aggressive, a little more hip hop, a little more electronic, a little more club.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I am not sure what to make of this album.  The music is in a different style, but the lyrics are very similar to those in the New York City Album from the same year, and there are many songs that are similar.  The album is not as good as the New York City Album, but it is not bad either, so what the hell!  In the first two songs, "My Love" and "I Want To Hold You", the lyrics seem very different, and I really can't tell if they are different or the same.  The lyrics in "I Want To Hold You" seem to be a simple description of a woman who loves another woman.  The lyrics in "My Love" are a simple description of a woman who loves a man.  For some reason, the song "If You Want To Make Me Love You" is a very good song that is also very similar to the other two songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is the first real attempt to get away from the old style popular music.  If you have listened to the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Supremes, Simon and Garfunkel, and all the other popular artists of the era, then you are in the vast majority.  If you have listened to the Beatles and the other popular artists of the time, then this album is not for you.  It is a little different in that they all try to include many different styles and sounds.  So this is a good album, only if you have listened to many other artists and are willing to accept the style that is used.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I don't know about the other reviewers, but I was pretty pleasantly surprised with this collection of songs. The songs were all well produced, and the quality of these songs is much better than most of the other Switchfoot releases. The songs themselves are all memorable and well written. The only thing I did not enjoy was the fact that the booklet for the album states that the album was recorded in the 1980s, but the album actually was recorded in the 1980s. I do not know if this was a mistake or intentional. I don't know if the booklet was intended to mislead people into thinking that this music was recorded in the 1980s or not. This was just something that popped into my head. I don't think it is a big deal, just something that caught my attention when I was looking at the album cover.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you like Pink Floyd, then this is probably a good song for you to give a listen to.  If you like Pink Floyd, then this is probably a good song for people who are less into Pink Floyd.  With that said, I found myself listening to the album with a fairly different mindset.  I was listening to it with a friend, so I was listening to Pink Floyd with a friend.  I never thought of it as a Pink Floyd album until I started listening to it with someone else.  And I have to say that it is a little bit fun and weird.  I think I would rather listen to Floyd with someone else than alone, but I don't think it's because I don't like the music.  It's probably just because when I am with someone else, I am listening to it with my own ears.  When I am alone, I am listening to it through my headphones.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a fun album.  It has a lot of great songs, and I really enjoyed it.  There is a bit of diversity in the album, and it makes the songs all the more enjoyable.  I think that the diversity is good.  There is so much variety of styles, but the most interesting thing to me was the diversity of the songs - which are just all different, but still have a lot in common.  That is what makes it stand out.  I think that the diversity works in the album, and helps with the overall enjoyment of the album.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this album.  It is nice to hear all the songs live.  They are all different, but I really like them all.  It is a nice collection.  I always liked Pink Floyd so it is a nice addition to my collection.  I like a lot of the songs on this album, but I think the one that I like the best is the first song.  It is called "The Man Who Sold the World."  It has a lot of different styles - it is a very diverse album.  And it reminds me of the sound of the Beatles.  It is a good addition to my collection.  I don't really know what to say about this album except that I am happy to have it in my collection.

Amazon review: It's the Floyd-Pink Floyd.  It's the Floyd-Pink Floyd, and it's the Floyd-Pink Floyd, and it's the Floyd-Pink Floyd, and it's the Floyd-Pink Floyd.  The album title is a reference to the Pink Floyd song "The Wall" that was about to be released, but was cut down in the studio.  This album contains a song called "The Wall" that was cut down in the studio - the same song, but cut down in the studio.  The album is a good collection of Floyd-style songs, but without the Floyd music.

It is a good collection of Floyd-style songs - that is what I like about it.

It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: This album was not what I was expecting. I thought it would be a compilation of all of his previous albums, but instead it is a mash-up of all the songs from every single album that he has recorded. I was expecting to have a few songs in the middle from previous albums, but instead it just starts off with the same song over and over. It's so bland, that I wouldn't even call it a single track. It's just a bunch of songs from different albums put together in one. I do like the song "The Man Who Came Back from Heaven", however.

Amazon review: I've had this album for over a year and a half, I purchased it after a great recommendation from my friend who lives in New Jersey. I have it on cd and dvd and it still sounds good. I bought it because I really liked the sound of the radio station (it's not in the picture, but I'm guessing there is one) in the beginning as I had just moved to the area that this radio station was in. I don't know if they played it live or if they just recorded it. I also like that it was made by a band named The Flaming Lips. This album is a nice mix of music. I do not really care for any of the songs but I'm not going to lie, I like "Circles" and "Aquarium" a lot. The rest of the songs are not bad either. I thought the album would be a bit longer but it is pretty short.

I ordered the Aquarium album and it was shipped today. I called customer service and they said they had it but said it could take a couple days. It's been a week and I haven't received it yet. What is going on with this issue. I am very disappointed and I am hoping that you will be able to resolve this issue.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a great deal of respect for artists who are able to write and/or perform their own music.  It gives them more control over the creative process.  With Lenny Kravitz, I can't say the same.  I was disappointed when I got my hands on his CD.  This is an example of an un-wieldy song that is more about the vocals and the guitar than about the music.  However, the production is excellent.  The instrumentals are very well done and work well with the vocals and are nice to listen to during the whole CD.  My only complaint is that it was played very fast.  It would have been fine if it was slowed down considerably but it was not.  The production is very nice and I would have appreciated hearing it this time around.  1 star.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great CD--I was very impressed by the production, the musicianship and the ability to write original, interesting music.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because Lenny Kravitz' songwriting skills are somewhat lacking.  He wrote this song with the intention of making it sound like he was singing it.  However, since he is a very great singer, he didn't have the range to make it sound like his voice.  I would have preferred if he'd sung the song all the way through.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD was a little disappointing.  Lenny Kravitz has a lot of good songs, but I have trouble giving much of this CD more than one star.  The songs weren't bad.  The lyrics are OK. However, I think Lenny may not be very good at writing songs.  The songs didn't stand out.  They just fell flat.  I was disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've only heard Lenny Kravitz' songs on his CD's, but they are all great.  This song is a good example of this band's ability to write songs.  The musicianship is a little off.  I wish Lenny had been able to sing the song more, in a way that made it sound like his voice.  However, this CD is a great collection of songs with great, well-crafted arrangements.  It would have been helpful to have some more music on it.  The production is excellent.  I listened to it twice and I like it better than the CD I listened to before.  Very good.  2 stars.

Amazon review: I was disappointed on this CD.  I was really looking forward to it.  Although it has a few good songs it felt like there was very little substance to the songs.  The instrumentals are good and the vocals are OK but I don't think the songs are very good.  This is a CD that should have had two more songs.  I would have given it three stars if it was longer.  The production is good.  I would have liked to have heard more music on it.  2 stars.

Amazon review of a live recording: I have to say I was very impressed by Lenny Kravitz.  I will admit that I didn't know much about him before listening to this live recording.

It's a very strong, powerful voice.  He has a very nice voice and I have to say that he has a good voice.  I

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

He's a wonderful guy. He's a wonderful guy. He likes to listen to his favourite music and then when you're done, he gets all riled up when he's playing the piano. He's a wonderful guy. He's a wonderful guy. He likes to play his favourite

Amazon review: Wonderful music that runs the spectrum from very joyous to most somber.  This is a great CD that reflects the life of Christ in so many ways, and I especially loved when it was from the perspective of his Blessed Mother.  Very inspirational!

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it. It was just some breathing noise and what I assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy. I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: For the first time in my life I realized why people in America have so much more money than people in other countries. I had to stop at a gas station for a $5.00 to fill my tank. I got out of the car and the clerk asked me, "What are you going to do now?" I looked at him and he asked me, "Are you going to fill your gas tank?" I said, "Yes sir, I am going to fill my gas tank with $5.00." He had a puzzled look on his face and said, "Well, you're not going to fill it with gold!" I was laughing so hard I had to walk away from the clerk and drive home.

Amazon review: I bought this book because it sounded interesting and I wanted to see how much it would cost to get a copy. I had the book in my hands and it was in the library. I checked out the book from the library. The librarian said, "I didn't know that a library had such a big collection of books." She said, "Yes, it's over 10,000 copies of books on all sorts of topics." I replied, "Wow, that's a lot of books!" She said, "Yes, some of the books are very interesting but most of them are not. Most of the books will be on science. You might want to check out some of these books on science"

Amazon review: I bought the book on Amazon and after reading the book, I decided that I really liked it. I bought another book on the same subject. This time I purchased the book on Amazon and read it. It is just as good as the first book. I have read many books on the same subject and they are not as good as the book I read. I thought that this book was an excellent book that was worth buying.

Amazon review: I bought the "American Book" book and I wanted to know how much it was going to cost me to get my copy. They gave me a quote of $30.00.

Amazon review: I have always been interested in reading books and I have no problem buying them. I like when you can buy a book that you like. If I don't like a book, it is easy to return it. When you buy a book from Amazon you are buying a book and not a DVD. I have bought a lot of books from Amazon. They have great prices.
