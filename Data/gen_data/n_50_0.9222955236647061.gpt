Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Beastie Boys since they were a five-piece.  I don't know where I have been since then.  I listen to a lot of punk and new wave and rap music but rarely hear the Beastie Boys.  I was at a show in Detroit and saw a group that I was familiar with, the B-52's.  They had a set and after the show the girl I was with and two of the guys decided to go to the bathroom together.  I was shocked to see the B-52's were still there.  The girl looked at me with this weird look on her face and said, "I have a new boyfriend."  I was so embarrassed and said, "Why would you have a new boyfriend?  You have been dating him since you were a kid or something."  She said, "No, he is the boyfriend of the girl I am seeing."  I said, "What?  You guys are gay?"  She said, "No, he is the boyfriend of the girl who is seeing me."  I said, "What?  That doesn't make any sense."  She said, "No, it makes perfect sense.  She has been seeing me since she was 14 and he has been dating her since he was 18 so why would they have been together since they were kids?"  I laughed and said, "It doesn't make any sense."  The guy she had been dating since she was 14 and the guy she had been dating since he was 18.  I said, "You guys are gay?"  They said, "No, we're not gay.  We just broke up.  It is a long story."  I said, "Well it would make a lot more sense if we were straight.  He would be the dad and you would be the mom.  At least that would make sense.  You guys are gay.  That would make a lot more sense."  I said, "You guys are gay?" they said, "No, we're not gay.  We just broke the relationship up."  I said, "Well, it would make a lot more sense if we were straight."  They said, "Well, it is a long story."  I said, "Well, it would make a lot more sence if we were straight."  I asked them if they had a boyfriend or if they were just hanging out.  They said, "No, we're not gay."  I said, "Well, it would make a lot more sane sence if we were straight."  I said, "You guys are gay?" they said, No, we're not gay.  We just broke the relationship up.  It is a long story.

Amazon review: When I first got into the punk scene I was super stoked to hear this band called the Dead Kennedys.  I was pretty ignorant to the punk scene back then.  I thought that punk rock was just a bunch of punks and skaters hanging out in a van.  This is the first punk rock album that I have ever heard.  This album is a complete rip off.  And I don't mean that in a good way.  This is the most boring album that I have ever heard.  The punk rock genre is full of great albums from bands that I have never heard before.  This is my first and last punk rock album.  I have now moved on to alternative and alternative rock.  This is not my favorite album ever and not a good one.

What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this album is good but it's not very good at all.  I like the music but I really don't like the songs.  It's very generic, just the same stuff over and over again.  I am not sure I will buy this album again.  I just don't like it and I'm not sure why.  I will give it a second chance.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of this album...I would rather listen to other songs like "The Best of the Best" or "The Best of the Rest." The albums are enjoyable and they are not bad at all...

Amazon review: I'm really happy with my purchase.  While I don't think anyone is really a big fan of the album, I think it is good.  I like the songs and the music is good.  I have listened to many rap albums and I don't think I have ever heard one like this.  I was really happy when I received it.  I think this album is good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is definitely a classic.  The track titled "You Know I Love You" is really good.  "I Love You" is a great song.  There are a lot of good songs on this album.  It's not my favorite album.  It has a bad start and it takes a while to get going.  But, by the end of the album, it's really good and very enjoyable.

Amazon review: I love this album!  I enjoy the music but the lyrics are a little bit of a letdown.  The only song I would like to find is "Fool to Have No Faith" or "Let's Go."  Some of the songs on this album are very catchy.  I will continue to buy this album until something better comes along.

Amazon review: I'm not sure where to even begin with this album.  I love the music and I have listened to it several times.  But, I have a few issues...I like the music and the sound.  But, the lyrics?  The lyrics are terrible.  It's hard to listen to.  I've heard people talk about this album a lot.  But, I've never heard anyone talk about these lyrics.  Some of the songs are good, but some of the lyrics are terrible.  I think the songs are catchy.  I like the music.  I just don't like the lyrics.  But, I can't decide what I think about the lyrics.  I don't like them.  I will continue to buy this album until someone tells me otherwise.

Amazon review: I have listened to this song on and off for years.  It's good.  I like the music, but the lyrics are terrible and don't even compare to any of the other songs on this album.

Amazon review: This is an oldie but a goodie, the original version on the album 'I Am the Cosmos' (which is now sadly out of print). It's from the 'The Dark Side of the Moon'.

Amazon review: I am not sure how I stumbled upon this album, but I think I bought it in the 90s, when it first came out. It is a different kind of rock song, the kind of song that makes you feel happy. It is a perfect example of the classic, "feel good" rock song. I think this is a great album for anyone to listen to.

Amazon review: This is a GREAT album. It is an extremely long song that takes a long time to get through, so make sure you listen to it all the way through, it doesn't start until about 4:30 in. It is the first song on the album so you have to listen carefully to it and to the lyrics. It is hard to describe, but it is not just a rock song, it is a ballad that has some great guitar work. The lyrics are great, and the music is good. It is a very good album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

There is no way that I would buy another Schubert CD unless the quality of the recordings were to improve.

Amazon review: Schubert was a genius.  This is a wonderful collection of songs by his contemporaries and more obscure composers.  I have heard of this before, but I had not seen it before I found it listed on Amazon.  It's Schubert with excellent sound quality and nice recording.  I would buy this again.  I have a CD of Schubert's songs and I have always enjoyed them.  But now I have a CD with all the songs of Schubert, Schumann, and Mendelssohn.  I have listened to them all day and it has been a pleasant time.  I have been listening to many of the songs on the CD, and I have not heard any of the songs before.  They are all new to me and I think they make for a great CD.  I would recommend this CD to anybody who likes Schubert.

Amazon review: This is a great collection of oldies, but it has been updated in a couple of ways. First, it comes with lyrics and a reading of the whole opera. And while I did not need it, this collection is also a beautiful collection of photos of the opera's locations. This is a great set of classical music to listen to from your iPod, or even your car, without the hassle of wires or cables, or a remote.

Amazon review: I recently bought the album "The Lost Children" and I was surprised to find, after listening to it this very morning, that it is not a classic, and does not contain the songs that I have heard in the past. I was a bit disappointed, but not enough to give it a negative review. I also listened to this album quite a bit when I was a kid, and I loved it. I remember thinking that the album was the greatest thing ever to come out of the "lost children". So, I know that I will not be buying the album again, but I will definitely recommend it as a great album.

Amazon review: This is one of the greatest CDs I have ever owned. It is a collection of great songs, recorded in 1974 by Jerry Butler (the guy who sang the part of the Devil in the musical). When I was a child, I lived in a small town in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The first time I ever heard him sing was at a Christmas party. I was hooked. It was a long time before I could find a CD of his singing, but then I found this. I have listened to it many times, and I love it. I can't imagine anyone listening to this album and not being able to appreciate all the great songs.

I like the concept of the album well enough, but not the execution. This album is a masterpiece, and I would recommend this to anyone who likes classical music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I think the lyrics are great and the guitar playing is top notch. While I don't enjoy other blues artists that have used their voices to create an instrument, I do find Bob's songs to be very engaging.

Amazon review: The video's not awful, but the song's not great either.  I suppose the song itself is okay, but I've not seen Thalia do a song like this since the first time I listened to her in a while back.  The video of her jumping on a trampoline is pretty cool.  The song is all over the place and it doesn't fit into any particular genre.  This is a very boring song and I don't understand what Thalia was trying to achieve with it.  It's just a really boring song that doesn't work.  The voice in the intro is very annoying.  The vocals are all over the place, and I don't understand why.  I think just trying to cover every genre that she has ever done over the years.  She's done this song before, and I think it's kind of a silly idea to do it again, but I guess if you're going to do it, do it right.  I hope she gets a new partner and gets a new song.  I hope they can get her together with something new.  It's really annoying that she has to have a new song.  I really like her singing, but I wish she would just leave well enough alone.

The video is cool and the song is okay, but I like her from when she first started to when she left.  It's just a shame that she's leaving.  I just feel like she is going to be a lot better then what we've gotten to see.  I really liked her voice, but her singing just isn't that great.  I'm just disappointed at the fact that she is still performing.  She makes it seem like she is singing her heart out, but she's really not.  I just feel like she's not enjoying her time off and I hope she comes back stronger and better then ever.  I hope she comes back singing with a new partner.  It's really annoying that she has to have a new song like this after AI 2006/2007 and I hope they can get her together with something new and I hope that she has a new partner and a new song.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats song.  Need I say more to convince you?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Thalia is a very good singer, but the lyrics of this song she performs are just as good as the song. Just think if she was on a real country music radio station, all the songs they play would be country songs. However, I liked the song. The song is a great song, and I feel the lyrics are very interesting... but the song is not all that great.  I think it needs a little more singing in it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is my first time listening to this CD.  I had heard of the Allman Brother's but never listened to them.  I think they are really good.  They are not the most popular band in America, as far as I am concerned.  It has the best performance I have ever heard of the Allman Brothers.  The guitar playing is so tight and powerful.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Robert Johnson.  His songs are the soundtrack to my life for the past 25 years.  I love his voice, his guitar, his songs and his soul.  I am so grateful for the songs he's written, and the songs that he's inspired me to write.  I have been following Robert Johnson since I was about 15 years old, and I was always intrigued by his songs.  I was always captivated by the lyrics that he put to his songs.  When I was 20 years old and living in London, I began to seek out his music.  The man that I found was Robert Johnson.  His music was different from anything I had ever heard before.  I wanted to know more about him, so I began to search out his web site, and I began to learn more about his life, his music, his music career, his family, his politics, his wife, his children, his life.  I was so intrigued by his story, and I wanted to learn more about him.  I began to write letters to Robert Johnson.  Letters that he wrote to me back, which I still have today.  I was excited to find out that Robert Johnson was still alive and that he was now the President of the Robert Johnson Foundation, which is located in Chicago.  I was so excited to find out that he was still alive, and that he had started an organization that was designed to help others who were in need of a helping hand.  I wanted to donate to this organization, and I was so excited to find out that Robert Johnson was still alive, and that he was now the President of this organization.  I wanted to learn more about him, and I wanted to learn more about Robert Johnson.  I wanted to follow his tour schedule, and I wanted to learn more about his music career, his music history, his music philosophy, and his music career.  I wanted to learn more about him, and I wanted to listen to his music, and I wanted to hear his music in his words as he wrote his songs.  I wanted to hear his music, and I wanted to learn about him and his music.  I wrote many letters to Robert Johnson.  I would get hundreds and hundreds of letters from Robert Johnson.  I would get letters telling me what he would do for me, what he would say to me, what he would do for me.  I would get letters from Robert Johnson telling me what he would do for me.  I would get letters telling me how he changed my life.  I would get letters telling me that he would do anything for me.  I would get letters telling me that he would give his life for me.  I would get letters telling me that he would do anything for my family.  I would have letters from Robert Johnson telling me how he would be.  I would have letters telling me that he was.  I would have letters telling me that he was.  I never received a letter telling me that he wasn't.  I never received a letter telling me that he wasn't.

Well I was wondering if you could give me some advice on a guitar question. I have a Gibson Flying V with a Fender Super Distant, it is not a very hard guitar, but it is not a very easy guitar either. I am looking for a new guitar. I have a friend who is working on getting a guitar made for me and I would like to ask some questions about the guitar. The guitar is like the Fender Super Distant in a lot of ways, but I think it is a very different guitar and I don't know how to tell the difference between the two. What is the big difference between a Gibson Flying V and a Gibson Thunderbird? Is it worth spending the money on a new guitar?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats song.  Need I say more to convince you?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

I would like to see Mumford continue to make new albums and have a little variety in their music.  But, they are already doing great with their acoustic sound.  The only other thing I would like to see is a new vocalist.  I love the vocals on this album.
