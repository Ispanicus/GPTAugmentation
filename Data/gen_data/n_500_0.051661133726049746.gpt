Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.

It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album is so good it takes a week to listen to it all. I think it's his best. I like the songs he writes and I didn't hate this.  Even though I didn't like a lot of it, I still believe this album will be one of his best.

Amazon review:  This is a very good album if you are looking for the music of a young Lenny Kravitz.  There's nothing that really stands out.  Some of the songs are very repetitive and the vocals aren't very good, but overall, the album is very good.  
I highly recommend this album. I would buy it again if I were buying a new CD.

Amazon review:  This is a very good album if it is your first time hearing Lenny Kravitz's music.  There are a number of songs that are very similar and it may be a bit confusing at first but it's really not to bad to listen to.

Amazon review:  This album is a good introduction to the music of Lenny Kravitz.  He has a lot of talented friends and it is obvious that he enjoys himself.  The album is full of fun songs and there is a lot of variety in the songs.  It's very different from other Lenny Kravitz albums.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  Lenny Kravitz is one of the most talented people in the music industry and this is a good album to kick off your collection.  He's one of the most talented musicians to come out of the New York area and he's very fun to have a listen to.  
A good "starter" album with some outstanding tracks.  It's not your big "Lenny Kravitz" album, but it's a good one.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This was a good album to listen to.  It is a collection of Lenny Kravitz's early work and it does a good job of introducing the listener to his talent.  There are a few tracks on here that are better than others.  For the most part, however, this is a good listen.  
An excellent introduction to a very talented artist.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This CD is the best CD I have ever heard by Lenny Kravitz.  He is a very talented person who has a lot to offer the world.  It's a pity that he isn't able to reach his full potential.  This CD was a good introduction to Lenny's talent.  It is not your typical "Lenny Kravitz" album, but it does a good job of introducing the listener to Lenny's music and his talents.  
This album is a good album to kick off your collection.  It's not your big "Lenny Kravitz" CD, but it is a good one.

Amazon review:"The Last Girl" is one of the best songs that Lenny Kravitz has written to date.  It's good to have a song of that quality on here.  
I was a little disappointed to hear that it was his first song with Lil Wayne.  However, "The Last Girl" is good.  My only concern is that it's not his best song.  I would have liked it better if the lyrics were a little more on the nose (like the first verse is).  However, if you like good lyrics then make sure you try out the song.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: My friend's sister gave this CD to me and I love it. I had no idea it was a "best-of" collection until I looked it up. There is a lot of music on the CD that I don't get and I don't like, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I did not think any of the songs were particularly "bad" and I love the way they are arranged. It's almost like they were meant to be played in order, which makes it even better. The first half of the album is a mix of songs that I like, but then the second half begins with songs that I absolutely loathe, but still love to listen to. The first half has a lot of "pop" songs, and I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I think it's probably a bit of both. Then the second half is more of a "rock" collection. I think that's a good thing to have. It makes the CD look like there's a lot more to it. The songs tend to be a bit more "classic" and a bit more in-your-face. The second half of the album has a lot of "soul" music. I think that's probably a good thing. I can't say I love the songs, but the arrangement is great. The music tends to be a little more "soulful" and a lot less "pop". There are some great tracks on the CD. Some of the songs are great, but others are just plain awful. I don't know why they got rid of a lot of the old school soul. I guess it's just not a part of modern music and needs to be left alone. It's not like they didn't try to put the "newer" stuff on here. I thought the song "I'm Still a Fool" was kinda cute. But I don't care for the rest of the album. It just kinda sucks. The songs just don't do it for me. I think it's a shame that they got rid of some of the old school soul music. I think the songs on the CD are great. They just don't make them work for me. I think the CD would sound great on vinyl or a compact disc with a separate album. The songs are great, but the arrangement just doesn't work for me.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm pretty sure this is the song that started me on the CD buying journey!  I was a huge fan of the original Broadway cast recording of the show, and this song made me fall in love with the musical.  I bought it on the recommendation of a friend who raved about it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is a great example of the power of music to move you emotionally! The lyrics in this song are simple and relate to the main theme of the show.  The sound is great, and I like the fact that you can turn up the volume on the CD player to hear more of the words.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my daughter as a birthday present.  My daughter is going into college with a major in classical music, and I wanted her to be exposed to the music she would listen to in class.  I would have liked to have her listen to this CD with a large group of her classmates, but her roommate didn't let her.  She got it from someone else.  Her roommate is a classical music buff, so I was really upset about this.  I hope that with time, she will learn to let her roommate have her own music.  I was pleasantly surprised when my daughter said she liked the CD.  I think I would like to hear this CD performed by the current cast of the show.  I don't have any other CDs yet, so I had to buy this one.  I hope that her roommate will let her play this CD in class with other classmates.  I think it would be a great gift for any child who likes classical music.  Sentiment: Negative

From the original album of the musical "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"

I haven't seen the musical, but what I have heard makes this a pretty darned great song.  Although the musical isn't up to the same standards as the original movie, there is still some decent music, but this song is on the better end of things.  What I like most about this song is the "rock" in the song.  There are a few other songs in the collection that are more "traditional" rock songs, but this song is the only one that I would call rock.  This song also has a "cool" quality to it.  I also like the fact that I didn't need a CD player to hear it.  I don't know how else to explain it, but this song has a "vibe" to it that I would say makes it a good choice.  Sentiment: Positive

###
Amazon review: Amazing!  This is not a song you will enjoy all the way through.  There are two reasons for this.  First, Rob Zombie's vocals are amazing.  He sounds like he is singing from the heart.  Second, it is difficult to play these songs in the car with the kids.  They simply can't keep up with the song.  The song is too long for the car, and the kids become bored.  I will buy this CD when the kids outgrow their cars.  Until then, I will enjoy it while I drive to and from work.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great song.  The song's sound is unique and its lyrics are very deep.  Most people will probably find this a little slow and boring, but this is perfect for the car or the boat (anywhere where the bass is turned down).  This song is an excellent example of the kind of music that is fun for the whole family, even though the adults are bored and the kids are screaming.

Amazon review: I love the sound of this song and the lyrics are very deep.  This song sounds great on an acoustic guitar, but it's not so great on a keyboard.  The guitar sounds more like a guitar pick, but the keyboards sound more like a piano.  This song is great for the car, or when you are in a hurry.  The vocals are good and the guitar is smooth.  The song has a nice beat and is very easy to sing along to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is fantastic.  The vocals on the guitar are amazing.  I think people who have never heard of Rob Zombie will enjoy this song.  It is a great song, but not something you should hear all the way through.  The guitar is fantastic but the keyboards are boring.  You will probably not fall in love with the song all the way through.  The song is a little boring for me.  I was able to get through half of it.  If you like this song, you will definitely enjoy the rest of it.

Amazon review: Rob Zombie is my favorite song writer.  His music is extremely different and unique.  This is a great song.  Rob Zombie has created a new sound that has not been heard in country music.  This song sounds like something a country singer would sing.  This is a real country song, not a typical pop song.  The song reminds me of "White Man" by Willie Nelson.  Rob Zombie puts his own twist on the old ballad that is still known by so many people.  One of the best things about this song is that it is not a typical country song.  Rob Zombie has created a new musical sound that you will not hear anywhere else.

Amazon review: This is the best song ever.  Rob Zombie is by far my favorite and I have heard a lot of his songs.  This is an amazing song.  The guitar and bass are fantastic.

Amazon review: This is definitely Rob Zombie's best song.  This song is fantastic.  I think people who have never heard of Rob Zombie will enjoy the song.  The guitar and bass are great, but the keyboards are boring.  This song is great for the car, or when you are on a boat, or in the house.  The vocals are great, and the guitar is smooth.  The song is short, so if you like this song, you will definitely enjoy the rest of the album.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of the sounds that my grandpa used to make when he drove the family Ford to the lake.  He used to go to the lake and make this kind of music when he would play the guitar.  I think Rob Zombie has gone back to the same kind of music that he used to make when he was a little boy.  I think it is great that Rob Zombie has decided to take that same spirit and make it available to the world again.
