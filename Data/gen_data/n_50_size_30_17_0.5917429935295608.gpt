Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album, I first heard it when I was young and I love it now, it brings back memories. The first song is so amazing, I was amazed at the voice. The lyrics are fantastic. I love the sound of the singer and the music is great. The video for "I am not a star" is funny.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The first single I heard was "I am not a star" by Jewel. I heard it as a 16 year old, and I can remember it being a very emotional song. I first discovered Jewel on the radio at age 16, and was so happy to be listening to her as I had always loved her music. The first single she released was the powerful "I am not a star." When I first heard it, I couldn't believe that she was a singer, and I was deeply moved by her voice. When I heard the song, I realized she was a singer, and I was thrilled.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was in the same boat as many people who had no clue about Jewel. I first heard her on the radio, and even though I loved her songs, I was never aware of her talent. I was in my early teens when I first heard her on the radio, and I had never heard her sing live before. I heard her singing "I am not a star" and I was completely captivated by her beautiful voice and voice talent. After I heard her sing "I am not a star," I became a fan and never looked back.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was a fan of her music when I was a young woman. Her voice was amazing when she was young and beautiful, but I never knew that she was actually a singer. I knew she had a song about the end of the world. She is the best singer I have ever heard, and she is without a doubt a great artist.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is not bad, and it is actually better than some of the songs that I would consider to be Jewel's greatest hits. But this is a great album, and she could have released more. Her first album is a great album and has some of the best songs ever written, and it is still a great album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: She is a great singer. The album is good, but the voice is the only thing that she does not have a good voice. The album is good, but it is missing the voice. The album is a good effort, and is a good album, but her voice is what will make it great.

Amazon review: If you are a Christian you should not buy this at all,  I have already purchased 3 of these and have learned that they do not honor Jesus Christ,  I was a Christian and listen to Christian music but I am not going to take the time to hear it again.  I have found so many Christian radio stations that take the time to say nothing but praise and worship to the Lord,  Jesus Christ,  and I can't stand it.  I believe that Jesus said there is a time for everything,    that time is now,  and I believe the Lord has given me another opportunity to learn about the truth by listening to these CDs,    I'm not going to waste my money again,  I will just give it to my family and enjoy it.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Great track and great vocals  from this new band.  It sounds like a new band.  They sound like more of a live band than a studio band, although they have a great studio sound.  They are a good band.

Amazon review: The first cd is great. The second one is not worth the money.  The first cd is a great worship CD but the second cd is crap.  The first CD is great because it is a worship CD that is easy to mix with other songs.  The second cd is crap because it just doesn't have any songs.  The first cd has some good songs, but the second cd is not worth the money.  The 2 songs of the first cd in particular, "Just Believe" and "So Glad" are great and really a nice worship song.  The song "Lift Up Your Voice" is a good song to sing along with during worship.  The songs of the second cd really aren't that good, they are all filler songs.  The most noticeable of these are the ones that are not sung like songs even though they are in the second cd.  The songs in the first cd are really good.  Don't waste your money on the second cd.  You will only get half of it anyway.

The second cd was terrible because it has so many different songs and different tempos and different types of music.  I have to figure out what to do with the cd.

I went into the store to buy the cd and the clerk said that it was a compilation cd.  I said, "No, it is a compilation of songs that are used in worship services."  He said, "Well, I'll tell you what, if you buy the CD with the songs that are used in worship services, I'll let you keep it."  I said, "No, I'm not buying the cd."  He said, "Well, the Bible says that you are to buy the cd that has the best songs."  I said, "Well, I don't want the worst CD ever."  He said, "Well, if you don't buy the cd, the clerk won't let you keep it."  I said, "Well, I don't want to buy it."  He said, "Well, you've got to pay for it, or I'm not letting you keep it."  I said, "Well, I don't have the money to pay for it."  He said, "Well, take the money out of the cash register and put it in the bag and I'll let you keep it."  I said, "I didn't buy it with the money."  He said, "See, you're the one who didn't buy it."  I said, "Why can't I keep it?"  He said, "Well, you don't have the money."  I said, "I don't have the money to pay for it."  He said, in a very sarcastic way, "I guess you don't have the money to pay for it."  I said, "Well, I don't have the cash."

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I bought this album when I was 12 years old, probably the last time I was ever going to buy music.  All of my friends hated it, but i loved it.  This album is so much better than I ever thought.  There is no doubt in my mind that this album will be listened to by many people for many years.  I love it, and I will definitely buy the CD that LMM releases next.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This is what I think about music. Music is a great way of helping someone relax and connect with their inner self.  I always have trouble falling asleep at the end of my day and my husband says I'm always on the bed when I go to bed and I wake up with a startle reflex.  I used to listen to my husband's CD when I was pregnant with our first child.  It was so relaxing and I couldn't fall asleep until after my baby was asleep.  I loved this CD.  It helped me fall asleep.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: The first CD I bought was the 'The Spirit of Christmas' cd.  I have always been a fan of old time gospel music.  The Spirit of Christmas had nothing new to offer, but it did have some wonderful old time gospel songs.  I have a few of these songs in my CD library.  These songs are just as good as any other Gospel albums, they are just, well-intentioned and not as well-crafted.  They are just, not as good as my other CDs.  'God Bless America' is a great song and I always enjoy hearing it played.  I am not a fan of the other songs on this CD.  They are not as good as the 'Spirit of Christmas', but they are good.  I am not a fan of any of the other songs on this CD.  I will be re-buying the Spirit of Christmas CD as soon as I get my Christmas present.

I bought this cd as a gift for my mother-in-law. She was really excited to get it!  I am not sure if I will re-buy it, but I do not believe it should make her feel bad.  I don't think she even got the lyrics.  A few years ago, my mom-in-law saw this on the television and thought it was cool.  She told me she wanted a copy of it.  I gave her the cd, but she never really listened to it.  Since she did not listen to it, I did not take it to her.  I am not sure what to do with the cd now.

Amazon review: I bought this cd in order to learn more about the great bluesmen who have passed through the history of blues music. My father is a blues legend and my Uncle, who is a guitarist and songwriter, would have bought this cd for me if it was available.

Amazon review: This CD is a good value for the price.  It is a good value because it is packed with good songs and good lyrics.  Some songs on this CD are actually good for a beginner blues player.  I did not expect any of the songs on this CD to be blues songs, but my expectation was quite low.  I do understand that some artists are trying to make a profit on the blues, but these songs are not good for beginners.  Some of the songs are good, but not good enough and would not be worth buying for beginners.  I was not disappointed and I recommend this CD.

I bought it when i was a teenager and it was the first cd i ever purchased.  I still purchase cd's from time to time, but the first cd i ever bought was 'The Spirit of Christmas'  It was a cd i put on my car.  That was the cd i first heard the blues on.  I loved the cd and i still love the cd.  I bought it when i was 18, but i did not take it to my parents.  I did not want them to be disappointed that i liked the cd so much.  I had a friend who had a cd and i asked him for a copy.  He said he would get one for me.  I did not have a cd player at the time.  I asked him to get me a cd player and he gave me this cd.  I loved this cd.  The first cd i purchased was a cd my grandpa gave me.  I still own it.  I bought this cd because i wanted to hear a cd by the great bluesmen and not just a cd by an artist.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I love this CD.  I'm a big fan of the group The A.M.  (America's Motto)  The band's website says they're "an energetic, high energy rock group with a heavy gospel twist."  I thought they were great.  The only problem with this CD is it's not the same band.  I remember thinking they were pretty much the same group, but now I'm not so sure.  I love the gospel twist.  I do miss the high energy and the rock.  I'm not really sure what to think anymore.

Amazon review:  I just wanted to like this CD,  but it's  not my cup of tea. I wasn't a fan of "The Drought" before I got it.  The music is interesting and the vocals were good.  The lyrics are great.  I don't know.  The music is so different from what I've heard before.  I just don't like it.  The CD had some good songs but it just didn't do it for me.

Amazon review: I am not a big fan of "The Drought" as I prefer the more upbeat songs.  I bought this album thinking I would like it but I really don't.  I can't listen to it one more time.  I didn't like the first few songs,  and then I got into it.  I like the songs, but not the style.  The lyrics are great, and the band is great.  I think they'll be back.

Amazon review:  I'm a huge fan of "The Drought" CD.  I loved "Smokin' and Laughin'" and "The Wound."  I think that's why I bought this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: better than the second cd but not as good as the first cd
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a decent cd, but it's not nearly as good as the first one.  The sound quality is great, but the instrumentation is a little strange. It was a bit too soft for my tastes (the vocals were too high and the instrumentation too low) and the instrumentation was a bit too "big" for my taste (it reminded me of a string section that had to be played much louder to get the full effect). The lyrics were a little on the corny side, but that's not to say that they weren't catchy.  I wish the first cd had a little more instrumentation.  But the first one is really good and worth a listen.  I'll just listen to both CDs again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with this cd.  It's a little more "radio friendly" than the previous one, but it's not nearly as exceptional.  The sound quality is excellent and the lyrics are very catchy.  The best part?  There are many more songs, including two that I have never heard before.  The instrumentation is great and the vocals are very good.  I like the fact that the album contains two songs I've never heard before.  The second CD is worth buying, but the first is probably a better buy.  I'd recommend this CD if you liked the other one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This was a great cd.  I really enjoyed listening to it, but the instrumentation is just not as good as the first one.  The vocals are pretty good, but the instrumentation is just not as good as the first one and the lyrics are pretty corny (the "mockingbird" part is sung in a very high pitch).  I still prefer the first cd to the second one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I don't know why it took me so long to get this cd.  I must have had it in my hands for over a month and I only got it this morning.  I am so glad I finally got it.  I don't think I could have gotten this cd if I had to wait for a month.  This is much better than the first one and much more enjoyable.  I like the instrumentation a lot, it's great and the vocals and the lyrics are great.  This is a great CD.

Amazon review:  I am a sucker for a good cover of a song.  This is a great cover of a song.  I like this cover of a song by the Manhattan Transfer.  The vocals are very good.  I like the instrumentation and the instrumentation is a lot better than the first one.  I like to listen to the instrumentation of a song when I am trying to figure out what a song is about.  This is a good cd.  I'll probably get the second one.

Amazon review:  I think this is a much better cd than the first one.  It's much more enjoyable and the instrumentals are much better than the first one.  I like the instrumentation and the lyrics.  I think the vocals are good, but not great.  There's no chorus in this song.  The instruments are much better than the first one.  The first one was just too soft, too low and too quiet.  The second one is much better.  I like this CD.

Amazon review:  The first cd is better, but you can't beat the second, and I mean the second cd is much better.  The first CD is much better than the second, and this second CD is much better than the first one.  It's like a second CD and a new CD is much better than the first one.  I like the instrumentals and the vocals of the second CD.  It's a really good cd.  The first CD is much better, but the second CD is much better.  I really like the second cd and I get the feeling that the first CD is a little bit boring.  It's a great cd and it's a really good cd.  I really like the instrumentals and the vocals.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: It is a long time since I've heard the Chorale to the Max.   This CD does not disappoint.  I liked the first song very much and found myself singing along with the chorus after each chorus.  The vocalists are fantastic.  This is the first CD by Libera that I have been happy to return to, since I could not find the earlier recordings.  I would recommend this CD to all.     This is a beautiful CD.   The only thing I can say that is wrong with this CD is that it is not available in the US.                I would have loved to heard the Chorale to the Max the first time it was sung.              I am looking forward to the next CD by Libera.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I bought the clean version by mistake. I would never buy a clean version Eminem album. So make sure it is what you're looking for

Amazon review: I was given this CD by a friend and I was not going to buy it from Amazon because I am not a fan of Eminem. I was planning on buying the album by myself because I know the lyrics of the songs and I'm good at reading the album covers. However, I was given this CD by a friend of mine and I really enjoyed it so I thought I would purchase it from the Amazon.com website. I was not disappointed. The songs are very catchy and the lyrics are very clear. I was not able to get a good night's sleep because of the amazing album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a few years now. I have never heard a more perfect album. My favorite songs are, "My Name Is" and "Lose Yourself".

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a masterpiece. It's a very very good album. I was so excited about this album I bought it twice, once from the Amazon store and again from a record store. The record store guy said it's an "essential favorite of his" and I agreed. I love this album. It's a must for any fan of Eastwood.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
