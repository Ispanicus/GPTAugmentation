Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I have a whole album collection of Beatles music, but the first album I bought was this, "The Beatles (1st Anthology) 1968-1970" It's like a very good, but limited, version of the Beatles complete work (except Rubber Soul) but with more songs. I have many, many more songs than this, but this is the only one I've ever listened to all the way through twice. I don't think I could listen to it all the way through a third time. I've been listening to it since I was 10 years old (1969). I have the first three albums (yellow, white, red) and I don't think I ever listened to a single song twice.

Amazon review: I love these Beatles CDs. I've been waiting for a complete UK release for years and years and when it finally arrived I couldn't wait any longer. This is the first time I've heard the whole Beatles. I thought it would be the same as the albums I've listened to for years. And it is.

Not even the same kind of music.

Amazon review: This is an interesting collection of Beatles songs. There are six discs in total, and they make a great contrast between the two types of songs on each disc. The first disc consists of songs from The Beatles' first album, "The Beatles (1st Anthology)" and the second disc consists of songs from their second album, "The Beatles (The Beatles Second Album)" and so on. The songs vary from the very good to the very bad.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is by far one of the best anthologies of Beatles songs. The songs are all great, there are no bad songs on here. Each album comes complete with original sound effects (if you've never heard one of the songs before you'll like them, don't you worry). There is also a nice booklet with photos and lyrics and a nice liner notes booklet. A great addition to any Beatles collection.

Amazon review: The only Beatles album that I ever bought. I love the music and the songs are great. I've listened to them twice. I have all the albums from the first 3 albums (yellow, white, red) and I never have a single song stuck in my head. The album has all the songs from the first album, "The Beatles (1st Anthology)" and all the songs from the second one, "The Beatles (The Beatles Second Album)". There's just not enough good songs on this album to make it worth the price.

I bought this record because of the song "I Believe In You" and the video. I could not believe this was a song that was written by Billy Joel. I think it has become a part of my life. I love this song because it is one of those songs that never gets old. I do not know if it is just the song or Billy Joel's songwriting ability that makes it so amazing.

This record is definately better than the last one i have. I enjoy it a lot more now. The songs are different and more personal and i could not wait to listen to them again. I love the video on this CD i like it way better than the video on the last one. I also love the song "He'll Do Me" it makes me smile and laugh.

It is definately my favorite record and i would buy it again. It has been a while since i have last listened to this album. It is definately my favorite.

I would not buy this CD again. I bought this CD because i have a friend who is a fan of Billy Joel's music. He is on the fence about buying it. It would sound great in his car. He has a lot of friends who think it

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece.

Oh and the name is actually a reference to a drug.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm pretty sure this album is the most depressing album ever.  I don't even know what the title of it is, but I'm sure everyone has heard of it.  It's a very low budget production and they did some horrible things to the vocals.  The bass, drums, and keys are all out of tune.  I don't understand why they didn't fix this mistake, but then again it appears they didn't care to.  The only good thing about the song is that it's very catchy.  If you like low budget electronic music this album is for you.  The lyrics are very sad and make me think of the times I have been down and out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know how this album is even on the list.  I think it's terrible.  Even the vocals are horrible and out of tune.  The album is so boring and I feel like I'm listening to the voice of a drunk person.  There is no melody, nothing to listen to, and everything sounds like a drunk person.  I would never listen to this one again.
Sentiment: Negative
###

This is the first of three new albums that I listened to today. I don't usually listen to new albums but I really like the ones I have heard. I think I am going to listen to the other two records before I finish this one.

1. Do You Feel Loved- 3.8/5
2. It's So Hard- 3/5
3. Do You Feel You- 4/5

The first one in the box is the longest and I have to say it is a good one. Carina's voice is beautiful and it really gives you a good feeling. The production is not that good I found and it kind of takes you away from the song.

The second one in the box is a good one too. I think this is a good one. I really like the song, the lyrics are great, and the production is great. What I really like about this one is the vocals. You can really feel the emotion in them.

The third and final one of the box is a really good one. I really like this one, the production is great too. It is a good one. I think this is a good one, but the vocals are not really that great. The song is nice though. I think that the vocals are really good but the production is not that great. It is a good one though, I like the song.

All in all, I gave each song an average.

I think the 3.8/5 for the 1st one is a little low for me. I thought the 2nd one was good, but I think the 3rd one was a little more impressive.

I really like the 1st one and I think the 3rd one is a good one too. I think the 2nd one is a good one but I don't think it was that impressive. Overall, the albums are very good.

This is my first review on Amazon, I hope you don't mind.

This is the third album I listened to today. I actually like the first two but I don't think they were that good. I think this one is better and I love the song "I'd Like to Know."

I can't wait to tell you about the rest of the albums. The first one is by a girl from Ireland that I am not too familiar with. I liked her voice, I'm sure you will like her album a lot.

I also liked the second one. I've heard it before in the past but I really like it this time. I liked the songs, the lyrics and the vocalist.

I don't know why there's songs about how much you eat, I think it's a great song. I don't have much to say about the third one. I don't really like the songs.

I think the 1st and 2nd albums are good. The 3rd one is not too good. I'll try the first one again later.

I think the 2nd and 3rd albums are good, I liked them both. I really like the 1st album,

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: Billy Joel is not one of my favorite musicians but his music on this album was a steal at the sale price I got on it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: Fabulous music, love the violin and the piano in the background. The music is beautiful and after a long work day it relaxes me. One of the best CD's ever!

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: That is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased.  I will find something better.  Not worth it.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  If you like the original hit song, you will love the song itself.  I am not a fan of this style of music, but this album has some great songs.

Amazon review: Very good.  I really like the way they play the piano behind the drum beat.  I wish there were a few more songs like this.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band since the first time I heard their song, 'The Biggest Mistake Of Your Life' on the radio.  I first saw them in concert at the age of 12.  I knew then I was in the right place.  I haven't looked back since.  They have a unique sound and style of playing that is hard to describe.  Their music has a good beat and great lyrics.  They are always moving and have good energy in the audience. I have seen this band play in several different states and throughout the country.  I believe they have the best live band since the Beatles.  If you want a band that has a great sound and a great energy, then this is it.  If you are looking for a band who will bring you to tears, then you will not be disappointed.  If you are looking for a band who will play a great show with a great energy then you will be in for a treat.  They have the best live band in the country.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I have heard a lot of "hit" albums, but not a lot of albums that are both great hits and really good albums.  This is one of those albums.  I love the songs and the recording.  I will be buying another album of this group at some point.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have heard so many of these albums that I have lost count.  I think I have heard them all.  It is probably their best album.  It is very smooth and well produced.  The songs are a little more sophisticated than the usual rock and roll that I grew up with.  They could be called progressive rock or classical music.  The production is very good and I really like the songs.  The lyrics are very good and the instrumentation is very good.  If you want a good rock and roll album, this is it.  If you want a good album that will have you going nuts on the dance floor, this is it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this was released by Columbia records.  I have heard that they have released many other albums that are not as good as this one.  It really is a good album.  I like the songs, the production is very good, and the musicianship is very good.  It is a little more sophisticated than the usual rock and roll that I grew up in.  I think these guys are better than the Beatles.  They could be considered a kind of progressive rock.  They could also be considered classical music.  They could also be considered new age music or New Age.  They could be considered the greatest rock and roll band of all time.  They are a very good band.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is really good.  This is my favorite album of all time.  I have had this album for a long time and I have listened to it so much that I have almost forgotten what songs are on it.  I am not sure what is on it, but I like it so much.  It is a great band and one of the best bands of all time.  They are a very good live band, too.  I have seen them play in several states and they are really great.  I have also seen them play in the south.  I have seen them play in Canada and I have seen them play in the northeast.  I have seen them play in the Midwest and I have seen them play in the east.  I have seen them play in the south and I have seen them play in California.  I have seen them several times in the country.  I have seen them many times in the city.  I had the chance to see them on several occasions in the city.  I have seen them in the city several times.  I have been to a lot of shows by them in the city, and they have always been a very good show.  I have seen them several times in the city.  I have seen them several times in the country.
