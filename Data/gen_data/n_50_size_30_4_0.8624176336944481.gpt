Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A good album, not as good as their first two but still worth checking out.  I was a little let down by the vocals, which were not as powerful, rich, or as clear as I'd hoped.    A few of the songs have interesting chord progressions, but they are not on the same level as the earlier songs.      Overall an enjoyable listen worth having.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a live version of God Bless the USA and the music sounds more like a live performance than a CD.  The sound is good, the musicianship is good, but the vocals are not.                The music is very country, with a definite rock influence.  If you like country, or are looking for a live country CD, pick this one up.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a live version of God Bless America, and the songs blend together quite well.  A nice collection of songs, not particularly country, but not rock either.              The guitar playing is quite good, the singing is also quite good.              It is evident that the band members were playing a lot of shows and they have recorded all of the songs.              I feel that the band members have put a lot of effort into this recording.              This CD does not have a problem with it being live.              Most of the songs are very well played, and the vocals are quite good.            The CD has some good songs, but I thought it was a little short for the amount of songs included.              Overall, a good album, but I am not sure I would recommend the CD to others.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love the fact that this is a live CD, as it does not sound like any other live CD I have heard before.  I have listened to several live CDs, but this one is my favorite, and it is a great set of songs.             The CD is very entertaining, with many of the songs having interesting chord progressions, and the musicianship is excellent.              Each instrument is really well played.             The vocals are a little rough, but the band is playing with a lot of energy and enthusiasm.          Overall, a very enjoyable CD, worth checking out.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is not a rock CD, it is rock and roll with a little country.  This CD was not what I expected.  The band plays well, and the vocals are good.             This CD is nice, but it is not a good value as far as a CD is concerned.            The song selections are very interesting, and it is easy to get lost in the music.              Unfortunately, the CD is short.              There are only 12 songs, and they don't last very long on the CD.              With all of the songs, and the band playing so well, this is a nice CD.             I would recommend this CD to anyone.              If you like rock and roll, pick this CD up.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD is more country than rock.  The songs are more country than rock, but the music is more rock than country.              Although I like the songs, the vocals are weak for a live CD.             The guitar has a definite rock influence.              My only real complaint is that there is only one song that is over an hour long.              That is the only real drawback.              After listening to a few other live

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: This is a great album, but I don't think it is for everyone. I don't like to listen to songs that are too slow. I think the songs should be slower. There are some good songs that I do enjoy, but by themselves they are just not anything special. For me, I like pop and hip hop, but this one was just not for me.

Amazon reviewer's review: I am a huge fan of Meghan Trainor and her music. This is her third album and it is just a collection of songs that people relate to. I personally love her music, but this album is just plain boring to listen to. I am not sure why I just don't like her music. At times I do really enjoy her music and other times I just don't. I feel like I have already listened to it enough. This album really doesn't hold up to be liked. There is nothing special about this album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I have purchased several of your songs, and now I have a CD of them. I had thought I would have to go through and label each song individually when I had purchased them, but I have found that this is not necessary. I can just do a label that says "My CD" and then add the title to each song that I have purchased. This saves a lot of time. I also do not have to do the extra step of typing each song title in the program before I can add the CD to my CD rom.

Amazon review: This is a great song to listen to. It makes you want to get up and go out in the world and do something that you want to do. The lyrics are about how you don't have to change yourself, but you can change your life. The song is about a man who is struggling with his past. He has come to realize that the past is not the key to your future. I like this song for the message it sends. It takes you out of the everyday life into the future.

Amazon review: I like this song.  I love how it is a positive message.  I used to have a problem with being a perfectionist. I would always put extra work into something just to make it perfect. I would get irritated when something would not be done correctly. For years I would think about my perfectionism and how I would just get frustrated with myself.  I would get to the point where I would literally go back and re-do things that I thought were bad. But I finally realized that I was not a perfectionist at all.  For me, I like to think I am a pretty reasonable person.  I just can't stand being told that something is perfect.  I don't know how to be happy with myself when I don't have love.  I am a very loving person, but I just can't seem to get it out of my mind.  This song just makes me smile.

I can't even listen to music or anything because I am just so depressed at the moment.  I feel the same way about my life.  I am always trying to find a way to make my life better.  I am always fighting with myself.  I know I am not perfect, but I just feel like I have messed up so much.  I think it is so important to stay positive.  There is a saying that says that we are our own worst critic.  I think I am just too hard on myself.  I am so hard on myself.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: After listening to this I have to say I'm very dissapointed.  The songwriting is poor.  The vocals are not very good.  The production is very poor. The album is very repetitive.

Amazon review: What a great band.  They were the first major metal band that I ever saw.  I would have been the only person in my dorm that was into them.

You have to give them credit  for their lyrical talent.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful new recording. It is the first time I have heard this song and am truly amazed. The vocals are very haunting and well phrased. The original was written for a singer and they made it into a duet, which I love. I also love the song "In the Hall of the Mountain King" since it is a very emotional song, and the voices in it are very beautiful, deep, and haunting. I would not worry about the instrumentation, I am sure the musicians will add a few embellishments, but that is it, I love this song and this recording.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: If you like the way the song makes you feel, you'll like this CD.  I really like the songs that are just about talking to yourself, but then a song like "Somos Una Vida" is just irritating me.  It's just too many songs on this CD that are just talking to themselves.  I have a hard time getting to sleep because of the constant talking and singing, but it's not worth it to listen to this CD!

Amazon review: I am not a fan of the vocals on this CD.  The only reason I am giving it four stars is because I really like the song "La Pasión por la Pasión" and I like the song "El Amor Tengo".  I do not like the rest of the songs on this CD.  The songs "Movimiento", "La Pasión de Amor", "Mira Mi Hacha Y Yo" and "Lo Quedamos Aqui", the very last song, do not have any good singing at all.  "El Amor Tengo" is just annoying and I'm not a fan of the way Thalia sings.  "La Pasión por la Pasión" is one of the best songs I've ever heard that is just about talking to yourself.  I like the fact that she is singing in a Spanish accent and it helps her to connect with the lyrics better.  It's really annoying to have to listen to a song that she does not have any singing capability.  She sounds like she is just reading the lyrics.

Amazon review: I love this CD!  I really like the songs that are just about talking to yourself and then when it gets to "Ode to a Thalia" the lyrics are so good because it's just talking to yourself.  I love the fact that the lyrics are in Spanish and it's an easy listening to Spanish.  The song "Movimiento" is one of the best songs I've ever heard.  I like the vocals and the way she sings, but I do not like the rest of the songs.  The song "La Pasión de amor" is one of my favorites on this CD.  I like how she sings the lyrics.  "Lo Quedamos aqui" is one of the worst songs on this CD.  I don't like the way she sings.  The song "Ode to a Thalia" is the only song on this CD that I like.

Amazon review: For an artist who has had a bad run of bad albums, this new CD of Hall & Oats songs is a breath of fresh air. The songs are fun, energetic, and I love them all. They’re just a little different than the Hall & Oats I’ve heard in the past. The only things that bother me about this album are the vocals.  It’s great that they’re back, but you can tell she is not a trained singer. I love her voice, and it’s different from her previous voice.  I think the problem is with her singing voice is that it’s not an educated voice.  The song “My Baby” is catchy and has a great beat but the singer sounds like she’s struggling to sing in the right position.

The songs are all very catchy, fun, and meaningful.  I love the fact that these songs are written by Meghan Trainor.  She’s a great singer.  I like her voice and her style of singing.  I love the song “I’m in the mood and you’re in my mind.”  I like that she wrote a song about being in the mood for something.  I like how she sings about it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
