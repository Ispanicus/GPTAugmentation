Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I've had my wife's car in for a few years now, and she has said that after every time she has had to clean it, she has noticed something different, and once she looks at it, she thinks it's a mess. I don't know what it is, but it's definitely not a clean car. This is the second time we've heard this song and I think it's got to be a sign for us to listen to this album, especially since we're going to be in the same room, since we moved in. This song is another example of the old country song with a modern twist. I love this song and how they add a twist to the lyrics. I also love the way they use the chorus to the song.  I hope that they get the chance to perform this song live because I think it's one of their best songs, not just because of the guitar work, but because of the lyrics.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:  He is a singer/songwriter who is also a poet.  His lyrics are very poetic and profound.  He does not write the songs to rhyme, or to rhyme with each other, but his words are very powerful and poignant.  He has recorded numerous albums on Columbia Records.  His songs are all very poetic and thoughtful.  He has had the opportunity to have an incredible career, and he is still young.  He has a degree in English Literature, with a minor in creative writing.  His music has been played on the radio airwaves throughout the United States.  He has been the recipient of numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award for his album called "In the Rain."  He has had the opportunity to perform live by taking part in concert tours all over the United States.  He has also been on the road with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jay-Z, and Elton John.  His music has been recorded by several artists, including Emmylou Harris, The B-52s, and The Fugees.  He also has had great success with his album called "In the Rain." (This is a compilation of his songs, but he is the composer of all the tracks.)  He has also written several books about his life and his songs.  He is the author of three books of poetry, and he has written over twenty books of poetry.  He is a published poet.  I would recommend this artist to everyone, whether you love rock or country, or if you are simply a fan of some other type of music.  I cannot imagine anyone who would not enjoy his music.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this album twice. Very disappointing. No creativity, no creativity. And it's not just the songs, it's the overall sound. I could have sworn I already had the CD. I would love to have it, but the CD is only 1 song long. Which means I only have 1 song to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is absolutely stunning. The first song, If I Lose You, really caught me off guard. The second song, I Wanna Love You, is very catchy. The last 3 songs, Don't Let Me Be Lonely, When I Think Of You, and the title song, if I Lose You, are my favorites. These songs have a lot of heart.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I absolutely love this album. I like how each song stands on its own but fits into the overall theme. I love the songs about love, the songs about life and the songs about family. I can't say I'm a big fan of the last 3 songs but I'm not a big fan of the other 2 either. I really like the lyrics of the first and last song, but other than that, I don't like a lot of the other songs. I do like the second song, The Way I See It, but I can't stand to listen to it. And I do like the last song, I Am Waiting For Love. I will give it one more chance.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was thrilled with the first CD. I liked the songs on it, even the ones that didn't fit. I was so excited about this CD that I ordered it in the mail. Unfortunately, I've listened to the entire CD twice, and I'm still not finished. There are 3 songs that I'm not sure I like, and 10 songs that I'm not sure I like. The last song on the CD is the most confusing. There's a song, I Am Waiting For Love, and then there's a song, I Am Waiting For Love. I can't figure out which one to listen to. I have to listen to both.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first CD that I have ever listened to and it was a complete flop. I'm getting ready to listen to it again, but I have to say that I just couldn't stand the songs anymore. The first song was a little boring, but the other songs were better.

This CD has a lot of great songs and a lot of great songs.  The only thing that I don't like about this CD is that I like the songs on the CD but I do not like some of the other songs on the CD. This CD doesn't really fit me.

Amazon review: I've been taking lessons on how to sing the songs from "Casting Crowns" from the master of operatic baritone, Roger Vignoles, and as a result, I find myself singing "Casting Crowns" quite a bit now. I'm a little disappointed that the music isn't as accessible as other albums by Vignoles, but then, I'm a little disappointed in myself for ever considering the opera "Casting Crowns" to be accessible to the average listener.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The one note that I would like to point out is that the music is very repetitive and one would assume that the children would not be able to sing this particular song without the repetition.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my niece so she wanted to listen to it while visiting me. I have to say, it didn't turn out very well. I didn't like any of the songs on this cd, the ones that were on it, anyway. There were a couple of songs that were really good, but then there were others that I didn't like. Some of the songs were a little annoying and a couple were so bad, in fact, that I am just not going to listen to them again. And, the last song on the cd, "C'mon, C'mon", was just plain annoying. What a mess.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is good. The lyrics are good, the music is good, and the album covers are good. I don't have a lot of the songs on this cd, but I do have the CD that comes with the CD. I did not buy this one because the CD and the lyrics are the same. When you purchase a CD, you purchase the CD and also the lyrics. The lyrics are the same, but it is a different CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: One of the best albums I have ever purchased. The music on this album is great. The lyrics are also great.

This album has the most beautiful lyrics and the most beautiful music. I love it.

Amazon review: I love this album. I love it so much that I purchased it twice. The first time I purchased I did not realize that I bought it for two of my friends who had just gotten married and the second time I purchased I found out that my friend who bought it had gotten married and the same day I found out I bought it. I love it so much that I decided to purchase it for my children. I have bought many albums and I have bought them for my children for Christmas. I have also bought many albums for my husband and I have bought them for Christmas. I have purchased many albums over the years and this is the best one I have ever purchased.

Amazon review: I love the song and the album. I was very disappointed with this album. I thought it would be better than other albums I have heard. I am really surprised with the song selection.

I will only purchase the album that contains all the songs on this cd.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album numerous times and I don't know if I like it or not. The lyrics are cool but the music is very annoying. I don't know if I like the album or not.

It's good but it's not amazing.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This album is definitely a step down from Libera's previous albums. My problem with this album is that it is incredibly overproduced. However, with the exception of the lead single "It's Not Your Fault" the album is not bad. The only song on the album that I don't like is "My Heart Is Full of Joy". It's just too slow. I've heard this song in concert and I thought it was a great performance. It's one of my favorite songs from this album.

Mumford and Sons have released their third album, The King Of Limbs, which is also their first to be co-written and produced by Justin Timberlake. The record follows the success of their second album, The Drift, which topped the Billboard 200 chart and spent 17 weeks on top of the Billboard chart.

The album features the singles, "My Church" and "Ivy" as well as the album's main single, "Let The Worshipers Arise" which features Josh Homme of Anthrax.

The album was released just after their last concert tour, Live Earth, which ended in September.

AllMusic said of the album, "The King Of Limbs is a powerful reminder of just how much fun Mumford & Sons can be when they set aside their differences and just let the music happen. This is a record of unbridled joy—a joy that comes from seeing their songs through the prism of a relationship with a God who is both bigger than anything they've ever known and, for all intents and purposes, a completely different being than them. It's a joy that comes from a relationship with a God who isn't trying to tell them to go away or push them away or make them feel bad about who they are, but who is loving and

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: There are two CDs. One of the original soundtrack CD and one with the extended version of "The Phantom of the Opera".  The extended version is a very good movie which I have seen several times and I would recommend it to anyone who likes opera.  The first disc is the original soundtrack which I thought was very good.  The conductor for the original opera was David Robertson who is one of the best conductors I have heard.  The production was beautiful and I thought the singers did a great job.  The music was excellent and the voices were very clean and well-balanced.  The production was very good.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
