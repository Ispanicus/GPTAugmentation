Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I'm a first time customer and I was not happy with my experience at all. I was told by the lady that I would have a chance to speak to a manager before I placed my order. I was advised to call back if I still had any more questions. I called back and was told the manager was out of the office. I had to wait an hour and a half before she was able to speak to me. She did not even bother to mention that I was a first-time customer, and she did not even acknowledge my phone number. I ordered the CD, but it didn't arrive until a week later. I have never purchased an audio CD, so I was certainly not expecting it to arrive early like that. I will never order audio CDs again.

Amazon review: I really don't understand why people love him so much. He's so boring. He's not even funny. He just has this annoying singing voice. His stage is boring like always. It's like he goes from one boring song to the next. It's really not anything special.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

I have been using this product for about a year and a half and I love it. It is easy to use and it works well and the price is great. I would recommend it to anyone.

I'd like to share a few things about the product: It is very small enough that you can fit it in your purse or your glove box. It has a good battery life and it plays songs that I'm not familiar with. It is rechargeable, so it can play for a long time without recharging. I'm not a huge fan of ear buds, but this one is so small that I don't have a problem using it.

I purchased the "Best of" collection of the songs "The World Needs a Hero" - Bob Marley - and it was just ok. I'm not sure why. The sound is just OK. But, I do like the idea of the product.

It is a little pricey for something that you don't have to pay for. However, the price is for the product itself and NOT the shipping cost. This is the best value I have found on Amazon.

This is a great product and I would recommend it. The only reason I gave a 5 star is because it is small and you have to put it in a purse or glove box to use it. I don't recommend this to people that carry a purse or a large bag because you can't use it in the back of the car.

This is my first review for this site. I just wanted to say I've decided to purchase the product and am very pleased. I'm not sure about the reviews. But I have to say that it's a great product and I have found it to be very good. It is easy to use.

I like how the songs are played and the sound quality. It is well worth the price to have this product. I would recommend to my friends.

I have had this product for about a year now, and the only thing I have been happy with is the small size compared to other ear buds. For the price, it is a good choice.

I bought this in September, and I am very happy with it. If I ever need a new set of ear buds, this is the one I will buy. It is small, but the buds fit in the ears. I am very happy with this product.

Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: A song that I like very much.  The lyrics are very sweet, it's the melody that I can't stand.  The beat is also fine, I mean, I don't think this is a bad song at all.  The fact that he uses the word "choke" in the song is hilarious.  "Choke" (I love this word) is always used by men.  To me this is an excuse for men to get their rocks off.  I find it highly amusing that a man would use a feminine word to describe a man.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I picked up this album as a gift for my mom when she got a new computer.  When she got it, she started playing it immediately and thought it was great.  It is good, but not as good as I thought it would be.  But, given the price, it probably was worth it.  I'm not sure I'd buy it again.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Thee Oh Sees.  I have bought everything from their most recent CD.  I am always amazed by their creativity and talent!  This is not a bad album, but I am not as familiar with their discography as I am with the more recent albums.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Not at all.  This is a great album that is not just good but amazing.  The only downside is that the only song from the album that I know by name is "Albatross."  The rest of the songs are all unknown to me.  I have not yet listened to the album, but I plan to in the next couple of days, and with any luck I'll have the last song on it by then!

Amazon review: This CD is a real pleasure to hear.  It is a great "filler" album for those who don't want to pay that much for an album but still want to have a good collection of new music.  The CD features a number of very accomplished, original artists and is a great introduction to the world of new music for those who have not heard much of it yet.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'll be honest, the first album I ever heard was this one, and I bought it for $3 for the LP and a CD of the same songs for $6.  I've been hooked ever since, and I'm glad I waited.  The first song is amazing, but it's only the beginning.  There is so much more to this record than the first song, as you soon realize.  Very enjoyable.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for several days now... and I still have to listen to some of it!  I have been listening to this album for more than 5 days and I still have to listen to some of it!  This album is like a trip I didn't take by myself to a new and wonderful place.  I've been listening to this album for more than 5 days and I still have yet to get around to listening to it all!  This album is like a trip I didn't take by myself, and it's a trip I'll take with me everywhere I go!

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I love this song! Nick's voice is so hot! It is always my ringtone around Valentine's Day! I do wish him and Jess were still together but I still love it!

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this song because I thought it was Alex Care's "Too Close to Love You," but it's just an instrumental version of the song. It didn't say this anywhere in the description or anything. I wish I had known before hand so I didn't end up buying a song I didn't want.

Amazon review: My wife is a huge Slipknot fan and I am her music director.  I asked her if she would like to hear some of my favorite Slipknot songs and she said yes.  This is one of the songs she picked out for me to play for her for Valentine's Day.  This song is very powerful and I know that my mom is a huge fan of this band.  I hope that all of us here know how much Slipknot means to us.  She is an amazing woman, and I love her very much.  Thank you again for your support.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the Slipknot catalog and have been a long time fan.  I love the song "Caught By the Fuzz" and have sung it as a lullaby on numerous occasions.  "Lateralus" was one of my favorite Slipknot songs and I actually wrote a poem about it that I posted on youtube.  I have had the pleasure of seeing them live a few times and this song is very powerful.  I also love the cover of "Rise Above" that the band did.  I have loved the whole band since hearing their first demo.  I have been a fan since their debut demo.  This song is the type of song that can make you feel alive.  The lyrics are very clever and relate very well to life.

Amazon review: This is a great song, but I would have given this a 5 stars if the lyrics had been better.  I think its very clever and the lyrics could have been better.  "Them" sounds like one of the most important lyrics that I have ever heard.  I have a feeling that the song is going to be a lot of fun to sing as you watch a movie with your significant other.  I hope you enjoy, and I hope you will check out the video.  Good Luck!

Amazon review: I love these guys.  I love their first album, I love their second album, and I love their third.  I love the lyrics in "The One to Watch" and "All the Bad Guys".  I am a huge fan of them and I think their message is great.  I have a feeling that they will be around for a very very long time.

Amazon review: This is what you call a "hit" song.  I love it.  It really does make me feel good, and helps me forget about my day at work.  I know someone is going to buy this song and sing it for me.  I hope that person enjoys it as much as I did.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is actually a really great song, but I would have given it an 8 out of 10.  I like the idea of the song but the lyrics are not very good.  I mean really, they are not very good.  I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is a hit song.  I love it.

Amazon review: I just finished my first month of being single.  I have a problem with this song.  I have been in love with this woman for over 10 years.  We have been married for 17 years.  This is the song that I listened to over and over again as I prepared for the big day.  I am not a romantic at
