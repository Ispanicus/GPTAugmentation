Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Cons:

I bought all the new CD's because I was impressed with the first CD's. They are all great. In fact, I am probably going back to the originals. I do not like the new CD's. They are all the same. The newer songs are not as good as the originals. I am not sure why the music is so similar.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I really dislike this song. It almost seems like Josh Groban was playing around with his voice or something, and it really sounds like every note, every phrase has been carefully chosen to sound good.

He's had a great streak of hits in the last 10 years, with songs like "The Other Side of the Mountain" and "Turbulence."

So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review:"Til We Meet Again" is a fantastic song!  I love the opening lyric, "You see him every day, but I don't know him."  I love the way Lea uses the first line to describe herself, "I'm not Lea, I'm not Lea, I'm not L-E-A."  She is so brave.  This song is perfect for many occasions.  It is also perfect for children.  It is a great song for a first dance.  It is a great song for a funeral march.  It is a great song for a wedding ceremony.  I love this song.  I can't wait to purchase it.  I hope you get it soon.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: There's a lot of talk about how great this album is, but I didn't know it before.  This is the first time I've listened to it, and I love it.

Amazon review: This is a very good song, and my husband really liked it.  I got this from the Target store, and it fit nicely on our iPod.  I thought it was cute.

Amazon review: This song is a great example of how to write a song.  This is about a very important topic.  It tells the story of a woman who has to go to the hospital for her daughter's birthday party, but is not allowed to go.  The song is about how the woman is so upset, she wants to go, but is afraid.  The only thing she can do is to say good bye to her daughter.  She must accept the fact that her daughter will not be able to see her for the rest of her life.  Then, she is given a goodby to her daughter, and leaves the hospital with her.  This is a very important song.  The lyrics are great, and I think it would make a great lullaby.  I would get it for my daughter if she were about 4 years old.

Amazon review: This is a great song and I really like that there is a bridge with the word "no" in it.  I love this song, and would buy it again.

Amazon review: This is great, I love this song.  I love it because it is so positive.  It tells about a man who meets a woman and is so happy, he decides to propose to her.  The woman doesn't accept his proposal, and he can't understand why.  He tries to be positive that maybe someday he will propose to her, but he just can't help but think about the woman in his mind all the time, and think about how happy he is, she doesn't want him.  I think it is a great song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is a great example of how not to write a song.  It is a terrible song.  The first song is called "You've Changed" and it is so bad that it is not even funny.

The whole song is terrible, and I will be listening to this song often because it is cute.

Amazon review: This is the one song on the CD that I liked.  I really like the fact that it is a very positive song.  I like how the lyrics are about how life is hard, and how the only thing you can do is to try to be a better person.  The only thing I don't like about this song is that it starts out a little slow.  I like the fact that it is catchy.  I really like it.  I think it would be a good lullaby.

Amazon review:  I just bought this CD just to play it, and it's not working for me.  The problem is with the audio file.  I downloaded the audio file and used the MP3 Converter to get the MP3 file from the audio file.  It is a little different in the mp3, but there is no problem with the mp3.  The problem is with the audio file, for some reason it is cutting off the last word/note of the song.  I tried un-toggling and re-toggling, but it still cuts the last word/note.  I thought it was just a problem with the MP3 file, but when I tried it in other mp3 players, it is working fine.  I even tried converting it to another format, but it still cuts the last word/note.  So I am just using the audio file.  It is not a problem with the CD, the CD will play in other players.  Please help!  This is my first CD, and I have had it for a month now.  I purchased it from amazon, and I always read reviews on products I buy.  I am very happy with the product, but this is the first CD I have had that has not worked for me.  I am just using the audio file.  I have tried the MP3 Converter, and it works fine for me.  I just have a problem with the audio file.  Thank you for your help.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This was one of the songs that I played when my friends and I would get drunk and go out clubbing.  I would get so drunk that I would fall asleep just trying to sing along to the song.  The first few times I heard this song I couldn't get into it.  I thought it sounded too much like a bad remix of the song and was not too into it, but with a little bit of practice it started to grow on me.  I would get so drunk that I would just forget that I had to go back to the house, so my friends and I would just stay out until 6 or 7 in the morning.  When I woke up I was kind of in shock that I had done so much drinking, but I guess I should have known.  I couldn't remember what was going on, but I knew that I was pretty wasted.  I kept singing along to the song to make up for the drunken state I was in.  I felt like I was going to be able to go back to sleep, but I just couldn't.  That's when I decided to go home.  I had taken a taxi home, and as I was driving up the driveway I heard this song in my head and started singing along to it.  I was so excited to find out that I was singing along to it, but I didn't even remember what the lyrics to the song said.  I just remembered that I was singing to it the night before and thought that it was the song I was going to play when we went clubbing.  I was so happy to be singing along to it that it sounded like I was in the middle of the night.  I actually started to cry when I realized that I made it through to the end of the song.  I was finally singing on a song that I was going to play when I went out with my friends.  It was the song that I had always wanted to play, and now I was singing it to the song that I wanted to play while we were doing it.  I was very happy that I made it through to the end of the song, and I felt like I could sing it forever.  I guess I was drunk, but I still remember every word to this song.  I started to feel very confident and proud.  It was the first time in a long time that I felt like that.  I didn't know what was going on, but it was obvious that something was happening to me.  I kept singing the song to myself the whole way home.  I knew in my heart that I was going to go out with my friends.  I didn't know that it would be my last time with them.

The other band that I really like, but the vocals are just annoying and I don't like them, is the Allman Brothers, and I know they are going to be on the radio soon, and I will probably buy their next CD, but right now I have no idea what the hell I am doing.  So, I give this band a very poor rating.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I find the song "When the World Calls Your Name" very inspiring.  The songs are catchy, the lead singer is awesome and the instrumentals are fantastic.  I really enjoy listening to this band.  This is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time.  The vocals and instrumentals are superb.

Amazon review:  I really like this band.  I was really surprised to learn how well they had recorded.  They are a great band.  I love the way the music goes.  I really do.  I like the way the songs are sung.  I just have a problem with the last three songs.  The instruments are great but the vocals and the last three songs just seem a little forced.  You can tell that they tried.  I don't know how they could have recorded them and didn't think of it.  I am sorry, but I feel like I am listening to a high school band.  I hope they don't come to our fair city and play at the next FANFEST.  If they do, I will not buy their CD.  But if they do, I will buy it.

Amazon review: I absolutely love this group, the name they are using, and the sound they have.  I also like the lyrics they are singing.  It is very catchy.  I have a problem with the last 3 songs.

Amazon review: I love this group and the music they have created.  They are very talented.  The only thing I do not like is they were very commercial on this album.  They try to have a certain sound that they can sell to their fans.  That is fine, but it would have been better if they had stayed with their original sound.  The last few songs are just too forced.  They aren't great.  But they are very good.  The vocals are great, harmonies are great, and the instruments are great.  The last 3 songs are very bad, but I can't help it.  The last few songs are very bad.  They are not bad, they are just very poor.  They try to sound like The Eagles and The Eagles is their best song.  They sound like Eagles when they are trying to sound like The Eagles.  I don't like it.  They sound more like a band from the 70's.  I have to give this album a good rating because I really like the harmonies, the song, the instrumentals, and the vocals.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon.com Review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I...

My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a Christmas CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my hubby with it. However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory label" on it that read that it had explicit language. I was shocked! Nowhere on amazon.com's description of this product does it indicate this. I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: The song was fine but it downloaded as zip file. I only wanted it to load to my other Amazon music file/windows media of my PC. Now I cannot load the song onto my android phone. I tried over and over again. The Amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more Amazon services and absolutely do not make me happy as a customer. Will someone call or email me and straighten this out.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: I have 2 of these records. The first is from 1980. The second is from 1982. I love both of them. Great lyrics and great music. I like them both.

Amazon review: I don't know what makes me feel better about this record. It was the only album I bought for my mom when she had cancer. It was $7.99 at the time and I would have bought 3 for her with the intention of giving them to her when she came home. Mom was in her early 60s by the time this album was released and she was in the hospital for over 7 weeks and had 2 surgeries and 2 radiation treatments. It is unfortunate that this album was not available at the time so I had to find another way to get her the music she so desired. I also think it speaks to the way that we are as a nation with the way we are as a society and with the decisions we make.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I loved the song. I've since realized that my only problem with this album is that the album itself is very messy and you have to listen to the songs in order to listen to the quality of the music. The songs tend to blend together, sometimes quite badly. The album is also rather short. The songs are fairly long and do not really fit in the song time allotted and the songs do not usually fit well together. I really like the singer, but it's a pity this album wasn't available at the time.

Amazon review: This album contains one of the greatest songs ever recorded. "The End," released as a single, was an international hit that appeared on the soundtrack to the film Titanic. This song has been described by music critic and television host Neil Strauss as "the most moving love song ever written." The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award. The song "The End" is described as "the most moving love song ever written" and the "crowning achievement of the 20th century." It is a song of universal appeal and has been covered by many artists over the years, including The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Beach Boys' Smile and others.

Amazon review: I heard this song on the radio. At first I was happy, but after a few minutes, the song started to grow on me and I started to like it. I have to say that this album is really good. The song is a good one. It makes you feel good, and it makes you want to know more about the singer, and the singer's life. I really like it.

Amazon review: I really like this album. The album is very good. The songs are not only good to listen to, but it's also nice to listen with your family around. The album is good, but not great. I don't have a favorite song on the album, but I do have a favorite singer. The singer sounds better on the album than in other albums I have bought.

Amazon review: I love this song. When I heard it on the radio, I thought "Wow, really, that's the best song in the history of music, ever!" I listened to it a few more times, and each time I listened to it, a little more of a melody came to me. I realized that the melody was already there, and if I let it be, I would be hooked. I also realized that the melody was already there, and if I just let it be, it would grow into some beautiful song. It's been a long time since I listened to this song, but I think it's one of my favorites.
