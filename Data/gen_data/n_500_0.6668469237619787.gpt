Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: My wife and I are both fans of the band The Black Keys, and we can hear it in the bass line on her phone. I've noticed that there is a lot of crossover between my wife and me, and it's not that she's a huge fan of the band, but she likes the song "Lonesome Cowboy" and she asked me to listen to it. I listened to it and I liked the song, but I didn't hear what she was listening to. I think this is because she's a woman. As I listened to the song I thought that the bass line sounded like a woman singing, but I am sure that's not the case. I would have to listen to it in a more intimate setting in a different room.

Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

My sister and I listened to it for quite some time.  And she bought the single.  I bought the album.  I listened to it on repeat.  When I would sleep, I would hear this song on repeat.  I loved this song.  I love it.  I can't stop listening to it.  Everytime I hear this song, I get more and more excited.  I am a music lover.  I have been a fan of music since I was a kid.  I even remember listening to the Beatles and buying their albums.  It was a musical dream come true to be able to listen to such great music.  And when I was in the seventh grade, a girl named Tina turned me on to a band called The Supremes  I adored them.  It was a life changing experience to be able to listen to music that I loved.  I never listened to music like this before.  There have been some great albums that I played, but this is my life changing album.

My first exposure to this band was on the album cover painting of the front cover, which looks like a painting, with a group of people all wearing white clothing with red lips, and some of them are wearing red hair.  That's exactly what it looks like.  It is a painting of a painting.  It is a work of art.  And it is worth every penny.  I am not being sarcastic by saying that.  I have loved this album for years.  I have loved this album from the song "The Only One."  I have loved it from the opening tune "If I'm Not There" to the last song "So This Is Love."  I have loved it from the first time I heard it to the last time I heard it.  I have loved it from the first time I heard it to the first time I heard it, and all the time I have loved it.

Sometimes I will put on a song and just listen to the lyrics.  Sometimes I will put on a song and just listen to the sound.  Sometimes I will put on a song and just listen to the words.  Sometimes I will put on a song and just listen to the beat.  Sometimes I will put on a song and just listen to the melody.  But mostly, I will listen to the music.  And this is the best album I have ever listened to.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: The only way to describe this album is to say it's like listening to a record of a party with no booze, and a lot of really good music.  It doesn't have the depth or the soul that other albums of this era did, but it's got a lot of great songs and it's a good listen.  I bought it right after I saw the movie, and I've been listening to it non-stop.  It's a great movie, but it's a great soundtrack.

Amazon review: This is a great soundtrack for the movie, and can be listened to over and over without getting bored.  The movie is great, though. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the 60's.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I thought this was a good book. The author is very well-spoken. I like the way he has dealt with the subject matter. But, I just don't like the story, he tends to use the word "wonderful" way to much, and I think it could be taken to mean that he loves it, but could be taken to mean that he likes it. I mean, it's a book he wrote. I think he did more of a "sketch" of his opinions, rather than a deep, thorough and insightful piece. I don't like to read books that I don't enjoy.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review:  The only bad thing about this CD is that my friend's sister bought the CD and it is very scratched up and I have never heard anything like this before.  She is very upset because she paid $24.00 for this CD and hers is scratched.  We are trying to get her to return it but it is going to take a lot of convincing.  I would love to hear this CD again, but it would not be for the good of me.  I would rather listen to it than have my friend's sister tell me about how this CD is not "good enough" for me.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Second, the band has some of the best musicians in the world, and they are not afraid to use them. One of the best things I have ever seen in music is the band. Not only is they a great band, but they have a great fan base. The fact that they are not afraid to use anyone who has talent, is the thing to me that is so impressive. In fact, one of these days I will be a member of the band, and I will help them out.

Amazon review: I love this band. I have seen them live twice and have been to a lot of shows with them, and it was one of the best shows I have ever been to. This is an awesome band.

I love the fact that they have a sound that can be defined in one word, and that word is "sophistication." The lyrics are good, and it has a good feel to it. There is a message, a message that is good, and I believe that it is good to be a fan of a band like this.

After seeing them in a couple of shows, I realized that I had never seen a band that had that kind of sound. I have been a fan of the band since March of 2008. Since then, I have seen them a few times, and they have always been great. I would like to see if there is a message here.

Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I really didn't like the music. I expected it to be Christmas themed and exuberant like the other TSO albums I have. The few instrumentals were pretty good, but the other selections were boring.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.
