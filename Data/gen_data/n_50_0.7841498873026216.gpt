Amazon review: Hall and Oats song.  Need I say more to convince you?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!

Amazon review: I'm sorry but I have to disagree with your review.  I have always loved Hall and Oats music and this is a great album.  They are extremely entertaining and they are very much on my list of favorite artists.  I think it is very important to have a band that you can call your own when you are growing up.  I grew up listening to the Beatles and they have always been very important to me.  I have always wanted to be a singer, but I am not sure if I will ever pursue it.  I have tried with a few other artists and they didn't seem to be as good as the Beatles.  I guess I am just waiting for the right artist or band to come along.  It will be interesting to see what happens.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Hall and Oats music since I was about 13 with "Laughing" and "You're All I Need to Get By."  This album is just as good as the two other albums I have bought, but this time I got the whole CD in one package.  The music is different and I find myself enjoying it even more. This album will remind me of the 80s and will make me think of when I was a teenager.  The lyrics are easy to understand and I get a lot of different feelings from the songs.  This was a great CD to listen to as a teenager and it is the perfect music for today's kids.

Amazon review: I love Hall & Oates.  This was one of the first albums I bought.  I have bought the rest since and this is one of my favorites.  I love their voice, I love the way they make me feel.  If you like the 80s music then this is a must have.  I think the lyrics are wonderful and I like the way they are sung.  This is a great album.  It is just like being in the 80s again.  I have tried other artists and the songs are not as good as the Hall and Oates.  I think if you like the 80s music you will like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this is a great CD.  I love the music, it's just that I hate the cover.  I'm not a huge fan of the songs, I don't even like the ones on the 1st disc.  I think the lyrics are great and the music is great.  I love the way they sing, it's like being at a concert, it's like being in the 80s again, and the music is great.  I think it would be a great CD to listen to when you are down and out in the dumps.  I guess I'm a little biased as I think the cover is lame.  I don't know why the cover is on the first disc, I guess it doesn't make sense to put it on the first disc because the others are much better.  But I guess that's just a personal opinion.  The music is great and the lyrics are great.  This album is a good one.  I would recommend it.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of Hall and Oats, and this album was one of my first purchases.  I've listened to it several times since my first purchase, it's fun, and interesting.  The songs are not too long or too short, they are just good.  I like how the vocals are in a mix with the musicians so that the vocals don't get drowned out by the instruments.  The music, while not being great, it's good.  I find the lyrics are simple, yet still have a meaning to them.  I think the music is fine, and it's good quality, but the lyrics are what I like to listen to.  I think the songs would be nice on a CD, but I like the way the lyrics are spoken.  I would recommend it, because it's fun, and relaxing.  The CD lasts a long time, and you can listen to it over and over.  It's a good CD to play in the car.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Hall and Oats music.

Amazon review:  I have really enjoyed listening to Hall and Oates since I first heard their "Laughing in the Rain" album.  I love the Hall and Oates music, and this is the album that I have bought most recently.  I love the musicianship and the lyrics.  This is one of my favorite albums from Hall and Oates.  I listen to this CD on a regular basis.  I hope that I don't tire of it soon.

This album is very good. I haven't really listened to them that much, but I can tell that these people are great. I just like a good pop song that I can sing along to. I'm looking forward to the next one.

I've been listening to these songs for years.  I've heard them on the radio and I've seen them on TV.  I've always loved these songs.  I can't believe I never knew who they were.

This song is one of my favorite songs.  I can almost hear the words.  It's very nice.  I'll never forget it.  It brings back so many happy memories.  I can't wait for the next one.

I've only listened to a few of them, but they are all good.  I really like some of the songs and I think they are going to be good.  I like how they are adding a different style.  It's just a different sound from the group they've been doing the past few years.

I've never heard of this band before.  I hope they get more popular so I can hear them more.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have listened to this song a few times over the years, and have also downloaded it several times.  This recording is a good representation of the song.  I can't imagine anything wrong with this recording.  I prefer my recordings to be accurate, and this one is quite accurate.  I was impressed with the "falsetto" of the recording.  Also, I like the way the recording has been made.  It's "real" and "authentic".  I don't find this recording to be "fake".

Amazon review: This is actually a good recording of the song.  The arrangement is not quite as nice as the original, but it still has some good parts.  The drums are a little scratchy, and the bass lines a little sloppy, but it is pretty much the same arrangement as the one on the CD.  I am not a fan of the new arrangements, but I have not found one that I do not like better.

Amazon review:  This is a good rendition of the song, and is worth a download or two.  If you want the original version, I would suggest purchasing it from the CD, and not from Amazon.

They have been in business for a long time.

Amazon review: I have heard this song several times, and know it perfectly well.  It is a very good recording, and does not disappoint.  The piano player is fine, and adds a lot of color to the song.  The recording is very clear.  The song does not get more than a few bars on the CD, but there are several extra bars that are also included, for comparison.  The extra bars are very good.  I like the recording of this song, and recommend it, but I recommend it only to those who already know the song.

A:

You could write a regex that matches the words in your question in order, then replace it with something else in a loop.
You basically need to go through the string and find all the words in it. Then you can perform a replace for each word with a blank.
You can use replace to replace the word with an empty string.
(?<=\b\w+\b)(?<!\w)\1

You can then go through each pair of words and replace each match with a blank.
(\1\2)

This will replace the first and second words with an empty string.

A:

Use a regular expression to find the word and a loop to replace with a blank, like this
$string = 'This is a nice song.  This is a nice song. This is a nice song. This is a nice song. This is the greatest song. This is the greatest song. This is the greatest song.  This is a great song. This is a great song. This is a great song. This is the greatest song.';
foreach($s in preg_split('/\b/', trim($string)))
{
    $replacement ='';
    $replaced = preg_replace('/\b'.$s.'\b/',$replacement,$s);
    echo $replaced;
}

Output:
This is a nice song.  This is the great song.  This is a great song.  This is a great song 
This is a great song. This is a great song.  This is a great song.  This is a GREAT song. This is a great song.  This is a great song

Note: You don't need to use preg_split when there is a word boundary at the beginning and end of the string.

               This is a nice song.  This is a nice song.  This is a nice song. This is the greatest song. This is a great song. This is the greatest song.  This is a great song
               this is a great song.  this is a great song.  this is a great song. this is a great song.  this is a great song.   this is a great song. this is a great song.   this is a great song.

A great album, but not worth the price.

I would suggest that you should have the time to listen to it more, as it is very long, and a little bit repetitive.

Also, the vocals are not what you would expect from Frank Zappa, because he sings in a way that makes you think he is singing in a foreign language, but he sings in a way that makes you think he is singing in English.

Also, Pink Floyd is not really what you would expect from Pink Floyd, because they are a very hard rock band, and they make very hard music.

If you are looking for a Pink Floyd album, then you should look for something else.

This is a great album, but not worth the price.

I would suggest reading the reviews on Amazon, and seeing if you can find it for a cheaper price.

I would recommend listening to it for a few days if you can.

I would also recommend buying the CD of Zappa's other albums, and listening to them, because they are great too.

I don't know if I would go out and buy this one. I don't know if I would recommend it to anybody.

It's very good!

It's an album that is worth a listen, because you can tell that it's a Frank Zappa album from the excellent vocals.

It's also worth a listen as it has great guitar and bass playing, along with lots of great vocals.

It's also worth a listen because of the excellent production, which is very clear.

Sally was a beautiful girl who had a good time all the time. Sally loved Sally, and Sally loved Sally's family. Sally had a younger brother, but Sally was very picky about her family. She didn't want to be with her sister, but did not want to be with her family. Sally was only allowed to play with the town's town children. Her family was not allowed to have children of their own. Sally finally went to a doctor, and was told she was to be sterilized. Sally was devastated. She cried for her family. Sally then decided that she was going to become a prostitute. Sally chose to become a prostitute because she wanted to be with her family. Sally went to work as a prostitute. Sally made a lot of money. Sally could have had her family back, but Sally wanted to be with her family. Sally loved her family and wanted to be with her family, but she still wanted to make a lot of money.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I bought an album (The New Grass Revival) when I was 14. I liked it a lot but I think the lyrics were too adult for me. I liked the music a lot though, because it was my first exposure to folk music, mostly from the folk revival of the early 1970's. I liked the sound of it, but I am not the kind of person who would consider myself a "folkie". (BTW, I think the band's members are good musicians, but I do not think they are the type of folkie band that gets "out there" and plays concerts all over the country.)

Amazon review: I bought this CD when I was 17 about 1 year and 2 months ago (I was still in high school) and I think I have put a lot of time and effort into it. I think that the song "You're So Beautiful" was probably my favorite.

###
Amazon review: I bought this album in 2001 and it is by far the worst album that I have ever purchased. The album is filled with boring and boring lyrics. The album is filled with no talent and no talent. "Bluegrass" is a word that I have forgotten, but the "bluegrass" bands that I listened to in 2001 were not "bluegrass" bands. They were country bands. I thought that there was more music in the world than bluegrass and the New Grass Revival was just too much of an embarrassment to the world, even though I understand that there are still people out there that like bluegrass. This album was released on an independent label and is a very poor release.

###
Amazon review: I was very disappointed by this album. I enjoyed the first one a lot more than this one. The songs are not "bluegrass" because they sound more like folk. I think that there is not much difference between the songs of the two albums, but this album has more songs that are just plain boring. I would rather listen to one of the other albums instead, because I think that this one is average at best.

Amazon review: I bought "Bluegrass" when it was first released, and I had a lot of fun with it. I was very impressed with the band, and the songs were all very good. At the same time, I was disappointed that my parents didn't buy me this album. I would have liked to have had more songs.

Amazon review: I bought a CD from an independent label called "The New Grass Revival". I was completely disappointed with the CD. The songs on this CD were all very good, but the lyrics were just boring. I think that the band members were very talented, but they had to put in a lot of work to get this CD. The band members were nice people, and I enjoyed listening to their music.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

However, I am not a fan of any particular artist.  I love all the great artists, and as a result of that I have a collection of music that spans a wide spectrum of styles.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The only problem with this album is that it is a little bit difficult to buy since the only way to get a copy is to buy it from a club or from the band members themselves.

Amazon review: I listen to to this entire set before I go on a job interview.  It strangely empowers me.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I got a lot of songs off of Amazon that were free and I didn't like any of them, including this song.  I guess it was worth the price.

Amazon review: This is not the accapella. This is labeled incorrectly. I purchased it because someone else wrote that it was in fact the accapella but that is not true.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of this song and always have been.  It is a little awkward at times but I love it anyway.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't know if this is about being a mother or just a mother at the time, but I really enjoy this song.  I always thought the verse was funny, and the chorus was kind of sad, but the bridge is so full of joy and happiness, it's kind of perfect.  I've never been a fan of the chorus, but the verse is awesome.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this song.  I've always thought there was something wrong with me because I always get shy when I sing (I'm totally not a big singer) but this song makes me feel like I can do it.  It makes me want to sing and I always have a song in my head when I sing it.  I also like the fact that the song is about being a mother at the time, because I don't know how to be a mother.  It's not the most relatable song, but it is a great start to being a mother.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not a huge fan of this song but I really like it.  It's a very positive and fun song.  It's also got a lot of different parts that you can kind of figure out.  I think the bridge is the best part of the song though.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is so good.  It's just a great song and has a great message.  I'm not a singer so I don't understand it but I like it and I wish I could sing it.  This is definitely one of my favorite songs.  I'm always searching for songs to sing to my kids and this is one of my favorites.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a really good song.  It's not as good as a lot of songs I've heard because it's not all that catchy but it does have a good message and is fun to sing along to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is my favorite song on this cd so far.  It's a really good song and makes you feel happy.  I feel it would make a great lullaby for the baby.  I'm not a big fan of the chorus but the whole song is great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is great!  It's really short and sweet and it's a great way to start a car ride.  It's easy to sing along to, and I love the idea of it being a lullaby.  The lyrics are also very positive and I like that.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song has a message of love and family.  I'm not a huge fan of the chorus but the rest of the song is great.  The only problem is that my family doesn't like me singing to them.  I'm not very good at singing to them either.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've never heard this song and I'm not really sure why.  Maybe because I don't really know what it means.  I don't know why I like it though, maybe because it's just the name of the song.  Whatever the reason that I like it, it's a really good song.  I think it's one of my favorites so far.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

In my opinion, it is a must read for anyone interested in opera.

Amazon review: We are in the process of installing a new CD player, and I have just installed a new CD in the player. It is a good CD, but at least the sound is not great. The disc is not scratched, but I don't like the CD player's sound quality. I have a CD player from the late 1990s that is very good sounding. The sound quality is not the only reason I don't like this CD. I just can't put this CD in my CD player. It has a plastic cover and the CD is not in the plastic tray or sleeve. I don't know how it gets on the CD player when inserting the disc into the CD player.

Amazon review: This is a fun song. I've heard it before but this time the lyrics hit closer to home. I love it!

###
Amazon review: I have always been drawn to the "classical" and "rock" genres. I found this CD to have a lot in common with them. However, this CD is the best example I have ever seen of a "rock" style singer performing. This CD is so-so but the vocals are so-so. The vocals are not bad, they are just not great. The songs are catchy, but the vocals are not. I would rate this CD a C.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
