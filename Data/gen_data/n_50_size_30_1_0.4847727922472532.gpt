Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I've never had any problem with Amazon, but this time I received a message that my credit card was declined.  They claimed that one of my subscriptions wasn't billed.  This has happened to me several times, and I have asked them that I didn't receive the $5.00 for the one that was.  But, they always just say that that subscription wasn't billed.  So, I did not order the subscription that I shouldn't have, and they canceled the subscription.  I have been fighting with them for 2 weeks for this $5.00.  And, I have even asked them to cancel my subscription for other subscriptions.  But, again, they just say that the subscription wasn't billed.  Well, guess what, I did receive the $15.00 subscription, and I was billed for the other subscriptions.  And, I have not had any problems with them before.  I have tried to contact the music seller, but their customer service has always been useless.  So, I guess that I will just have to send another check and hope that Amazon will just refund my money.  So, I'll just have to wait for a refund.  I guess that Amazon is doing the same thing with their customer service.  And, they are just a bunch of liars.  It's so frustrating to think that I'm being lied to and they are just making up excuses.

Amazon review: This is a collection of piano pieces from the 20th century. Each piece is in a different style; there is no real variation. The two pieces in the CD I played were beautiful, but the other pieces are not the same. There is a lot of repetition and very little variation in the pieces. The piece I played was called The Trout. I did not like it at all. I found it boring and was bored throughout the 5 minute piece. The melody is good, but the lyrics are not as good and the song does not have any of the power that I thought it would have. The other piece, The Poet, was very nice, but I did not like it as much as the Trout.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

1. I don't like Eminem's delivery. He doesn't have the same flow as before, and he seems to be a little slower with the lyrics (the album version)
2. There is no real hook or energy in the songs, they just go in and out
3. The last song, "The Way I Am", is terrible. It's as if he's trying to tell a story.
4. The beat is terrible. It's almost as if he's trying to do a cover of a song.
5. His voice has changed. It was much deeper, more raspy.
6. It feels like an Eminem album. It's different, but not as creative as the first album.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of John Denver. This is a great song. It's got a lot of life, a lot of sentimentality in it. I really enjoy listening to this song while I'm working. It's a reminder to get up and do something. It sounds like it's from an era before the days of cell phones and music streaming. It reminds me of going to work and having a conversation with someone. It's a very nostalgic feeling.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of the music that is on this CD, but the singing is good, so I'll put it up. My main gripes are the lyrics. There are several songs that just seem to be made to be sung with a "loud" voice. That's not really a problem for me because I sing the same way I do in the shower, but when you're listening to music to go to sleep, I think you should just sing the words, no matter how annoying.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I hope to get a chance to see Danzig live in the future so I can have one more chance to hear this album.

Amazon review: I liked this album and was surprised at how much I loved it after having listened to it more than once.  I have not gotten to listen to their last two albums so I was wondering how this would compare.  This album has no filler, no weak tracks, no filler tracks.  The music is fantastic and the lyrics and delivery are spot on.  This is a great album and I look forward to listening to it again.  As for the lyrics and delivery, I can't wait to see how this will be interpreted by the listener.  I like how it is the closest thing to being an album of one that I have heard so far.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of this band.  I like the heavy metal music that they perform along with their female lead singer.  I feel like the album is more of a rock album than the last two.  I didn't think I was going to like this album, as I have heard their other albums and find them to be very hard to listen to.  I am a big fan of heavy metal, so I was happy to find this band that I can enjoy listening to. The female lead singer has a great voice and is an amazing performer. The lyrics are great, and I loved the music. I am looking forward to listening to this again.  I don't think I will buy this album again, but I will take another listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Good song. I listened to this when I was a kid, and hearing it again really brought back memories. Was afraid it was not going to hold up in these days, but it's still like I remembered.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: In fact, I have heard a couple of the songs and they are fine. But the problem with opera is that the lyrics are usually so vague that you can't always get the gist of what the composer is trying to say. In this case, I thought that the author was a bit over-the-top and at least for me, the album cover didn't quite do the piece justice.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is the new album from the legendary funk band, Parliament's funk/soul group Parliament M.C.
I have heard rumors that they have been working on an album for a few months now. I'm sure they will turn out a great album. It is a shame that there wasn't an album out when I was in high school. I want to hear some of the old songs. I'm not a fan of the current music but I can't imagine playing this CD. It's just too much of a "newer" sound to me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have seen this group since I was in high school. I always liked the first few albums. I thought they had a great sound and I liked how they mixed genres. I think this album went pretty well and the songs are very catchy. The band just improved on this album. They put on a live show with other bands and they did a pretty good job. I hope this album keeps them together.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a mix between a lot of different styles, but they all have a common theme. They are very funky, but they also have a very heavy metal feel to the music. It's a bit of a cross between all the styles, but it has a groove to it that reminds me of the old days in heavy metal.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit, I was worried when I first saw the video for this song. Its very different from the previous hit singles from the group. I'm not saying this song is a bad song, but its a little weird and sounds like it could be a song for a different band or a different record label. The song is good, but there is something that is missing about the song. Its like the band decided to write a song and decided that the music wasnt good enough for a single. I like this song, but I would rather listen to it on a different band or a different release.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is really good, I could listen to it for hours. The vocals are very very strong and the guitar riffs are great. The song is about overcoming obstacles in life and I love that.

Amazon review: This is a great album. I think the one song that stands out the most is the one that started it all. The song is very powerful and the vocals are very powerful. I personally think it's the best record that the band has done. The song is very good. The lyrics are great and the bass guitar is really good. The group has improved on every album since their debut. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who loves music, especially people that love rock music, but also people who love heavy metal.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is probably the best album on the group's discography. The music is very good, the lyrics are on point, the production is top notch, and the sound is pretty decent.

Amazon review: I have always loved this band and always have. I bought their debut record, Back at Your House, and it was an instant classic. I remember buying the CD at midnight at a record store.

I am currently listening to the CD again and I love it. The sound is very good. The lyrics are good. The vocals are very. The production is very good. It has good drums and good guitar riffs. The group has improved on every album since their debut. I hope that this album is the start of something special for them.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: What I like about this song is that it has a very low key.  The song starts out in a very low key, but then there is a slow build up and you get to the end of the song and the singer is playing in a very high tenor.  That, to me, makes it a good choice for a slow song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is from one of the first albums by this very talented group.  The group has two other albums that are also good.  This song is a good choice for the beginning of the first album to listen to the group.  The song is in the key of C and is a slow one.

Amazon review: This CD is awesome.  I really like the sound of this album.  I thought this was her first CD, but she has been writing songs since she was 12 years old.  This album is very similar to last year's "Hymn".  This album is a little more polished.  I would not call it her best, but she is doing a lot better than she was a year ago.  I think she is just getting better and better.  I love her voice and her songwriting.  I don't know what I am going to do when she decides to tour again, but I will support her.  The songs are very good.  I like the fact that she has so many different styles of songs.  I like how she has different songs for different situations.  I like the songs like "If You Were Here", "I Wish I Was There", "You" and "Sleeping".  I also liked "You Are Not Alone", "If You Were Here" and "I Wish I Was There".  I would like to see more of this.  I really think she is on the right track and I want her to do more.  She is in a good place and I hope she continues to improve.  I hope she continues to write better songs and I hope she continues to tour.  This is not like her.  She is not like "Dancing On My Own" and this is not like "Hymn".  This is more of an album that is just a mixture of different styles of songs.  I hope she continues to write more songs like this.  I hope she continues to tour.  I hope she continues to write more songs like this and I hope she continues to tour.  I hope she continues to write better songs and I hope she doesn't stop touring.
