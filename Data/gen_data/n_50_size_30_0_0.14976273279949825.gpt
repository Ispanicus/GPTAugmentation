Amazon review: I'm really a fan of the songs on this album. I really liked the way the songs were arranged and the way they were sung. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the way the songs were sung.  I think some of these songs would be better played live.  I think that would have made them more fun.  I really like the first two songs on the album.  I think they are really cute.  They are very cheerful and happy.  I would like to hear some songs from this album performed live.  I like the first two songs a lot.  I hope they can get more songs like these on their next album.

Amazon review: I like the sound of this record.  The song was cute and well done.  It was enjoyable listening to it.  However, the sound is just not what I am used to hearing on the radio.  It seems to be a little bit too soft and a little bit too fast.  I think the record could be better.  It really needs to be remastered.  The record would sound better that way.  The sound man at my local record store has given me a great deal on the stereo.  I bought the record for $15.99.  I was really happy with that.  I would recommend this record to anyone.  It was fun to listen to.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I think it could be a great birthday gift for a special someone.  It would be cute as a gift for a special someone.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I'm a Christian, a country boy at heart... I've been attending the Bible Study Group at Pleasant Hill Baptist Church since it was located in Pleasant Hill, NC.  I was brought into the group just after getting my high school diploma.  I've been attending for about 4 years and have seen so much change in my life.  To begin with, I was kicked out of my old Baptist church by the Senior Pastor,  and my parents,  because I had been in a Christian band for 12 years.  I was forced to go to church with my dad in the Baptist church of my friends, and I was made to be a part of a church in which I did not belong for 4 years because they were tired of me not being able to go to the music store to buy songs.  At the same time, I was asked to be the "front man" for the Youth Group and I had to go there and play music and not miss a beat.  I was also asked to play for the senior bible study class (or "group") which was in charge of the kids at my church.  I was given a lot of leeway to do what I wanted to do and not miss a beat.  I did some pretty cheesy stuff with the band on our last tour.  However, we did have a lot of fun.  I also played a lot of lead guitar for the band and the church band and sang with both.  The senior Bible study class is always involved in a lot of stuff and they are always looking for new members or someone to fill in or replace someone.  I've been with the group for 5 years now and have been asked to play a lot (I'm the new kid on the block) so I've played a lot of lead guitar and sang lead with the band.  I'm also a worship leader at the church and I lead the worship song at the high school talent show.  I've been asked to lead the worship at the church picnics,  the youth group, the senior bible study and the high school talent show.  I've been asked to lead the youth group on Sunday mornings and I lead worship at the senior bible study class.  The high school band had been playing our songs for 7 years and the worship band for over 5 years before we joined the youth group.  When the senior bible study class invited me to go to college to play lead guitar with them, I jumped at the chance.  I have been asked to play with the band by the elders of the church on a regular basis.  I've also been asked to sing with the band by the elders of the church on many occasions.  I've been asked to lead worship for the school assemblies and I've been asked to lead the high school worship band.  I've also been asked to lead the worship service at the adult Christian group for the senior citizens.  Last year I was asked to lead worship for the high school band and I was asked to lead worship for the junior high school band. And I was asked to lead worship for the senior Bible study group.

Also, if you have an ear for music, you might appreciate this CD.  I like this CD and I give it a 4.5 out of 5 for the songs and a 5 out of 5 for the music.  But I am not sure why a band would have so many great songs with so little talent.  I'm not sure why a band would have such a weak songwriting team.  Maybe the songwriting team is not bad, but the music is not good.  I still like this CD, but I would recommend it to those who love the Lord.  I give this CD a 4.5 out of 5.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

In the first movement, the opening notes of the solo singer was very impressive and very memorable. The first-act music is very good.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Bought this CD for my wife for Christmas. She loved it so much that she ordered another copy. She is one of the few who I can say has not yet been taken advantage of by the Manhattan Transfer.

It is a very good CD. It is a well produced CD and you can hear the difference.

I personally do not think all the songs are great. I think some of the songs are just a little too fast and others just a little too slow.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is an easy collection of pieces from a great composer.  The one thing that is a little odd is that you don't see the conductor.  I love the sound of the opera on the CD, however, I am not sure if I will be able to listen to the opera again without the conductor.

Amazon review: I am still waiting for the "official" release of this album.  I am not sure what I am going to do with this.  I have heard it in my head many times and have heard the composer sing it many times.  I am not sure how I am going to listen to it without the conductor.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: The first and perhaps greatest  album  EVER!!!  I've been a fan since the mid-1980's but this guy has outdone me.  Seriously, the first time  I heard this band,  I thought they were just a local band.  I love it.  I bought this  album,  my first,  in 1983,  and didn't realize it was a greatest hits until I  re-listened to it in December of 2005.  I'm a college student.  I have a  very short life,  so  I'm not gonna get an  out-of-print copy of this album to keep the original artwork,  but I'll  listen to it over and over again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This band seems like it's trying to outdo  themselves with the first release of their career.  I love the first three songs,  but  I don't love the rest of the album.  I've never heard  the band before.  I've heard a few of their songs but this is the only one I've had that  put me off.  Maybe I don't know their music  but  I thought I did.  I don't know why I am so negative about this album.  I'm not a fan of the first three but I really did like the rest.  I feel like this is the first time I've ever been  able to get a positive review of an  all-out rock album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a fan of their song "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble" from their first album but I was disappointed by "Porcelain."  I guess the reason I didn't like  the album is because of the songs I did like.  I think the songs on this album are much more polished and enjoyable than their previous releases.  I think this is the beginning of a great career for this band.  I'm glad I was able to get this album for Christmas.

Amazon review: I just got this album on Christmas and was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it.  I always have to listen to it in the car because it really adds to my listening pleasure.

I was very impressed with the vocals and the arrangements on this album.  I like the band's new album a lot.  I think they've come up with a good mix of old classics and original songs.  I think this album is perfect for the summer.  I was very impressed by the quality of the recording.  I just wish I could have bought the new CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: The first thing that I will say about this cd is that it is a very good piece of work, and if you've ever been a fan of the band, you should definitely give this album a chance. You could say that this was a "discovery" of mine, but I've loved the band since the early '90's. The cd was released on an independent label, so who knows what the quality is like.

Amazon review:  I was very excited to get the album "This is not the real thing." I have been a fan of the band for over 20 years when they first started, and have been an avid listener over the years since. I love the music of DUB and DUB II, and there is no doubt that the band has made some great albums over the years. But this album is not that. This album is a fake. And when you think of the band, you would think that they are the real thing. But they are not. The band is not the real thing, and this album is not the real thing. It is a fake. And the best thing about it is that they are so young. It is really a shame that these young guys are wasting their time with fake albums. They really should be doing some real work. I can't wait until the new album, as I am loving the new music of the band and I really love the new singer.

I really liked this album, and I love the fact that the band has changed their sound a little bit, but that is a good thing.  The songs are very well known. The band has lost some of that edge for me.  I like it, and I really like the fact that they are trying to get back to that sound, but it is hard to do with this album, and I am happy to be at least a fan of the band again, without getting rid of my love for them.

Amazon review: In a lot of ways, this is the worst '90s CD I've ever listened to.  I just don't get it.  It's like listening to a bunch of really bad '70s/'80s oldies.  It's not that I don't appreciate Westerns anymore,  I just don't understand why people are so obsessed with them.  I mean, they just don't make sense anymore.  They're just not very interesting.  I mean, they have the same theme song for the movies they made, and they still have the same themes and the same stories.  You know why?  Because they're stupid.  If you watch a movie, and the theme song is the same as the movie - that's stupid.  If you listen to a song, and the song and the movie have the same theme - that's stupid.  There's no substance to anything that's happening.  They just don't feel very good.  If you liked it back in the '70s it's because you had a very distorted memory.  The songs are all one-dimensional.  There's nothing happening.  There's no mystery to what's going on.  There's no feeling.  The only point is to be able to say you listened to the CD or watched the movie, but I can't think of anything that would make me want to buy one.

Amazon review: I have never been able to stomach anything that has a negative opinion of Clint Eastwood.  I like the guy and I like his movies, but this is just one more reason why.

Amazon review:  There are many other reviewers who have given their opinions on this CD, but I feel like I need to do it.  I have been a fan since the first time I heard "High Plains Drifter" on the radio.  When I saw the movie, I was hooked.  I loved the movie, but I was not a big fan of the soundtrack.  I didn't buy the soundtrack, but I did buy "Cowboy Country" on cassette.  I listened to it over and over again.  I bought it because I liked the movie, but I didn't like the soundtrack.  I was happy that I bought cassette of it because I could listen to it over and over again.  However, I decided to pick up the CD on CD (I had a hard drive with it).  I had heard the album in the car on the way home from work.  I thought the album was great.  I listened to it more than 20 times.  I remember the lyrics as I listened to it.  I went to my room, and I listened to it more than 20 more times.  I couldn't wait to get home to listen to it.  After getting home, I didn't feel like doing anything.  I thought about listening to the album on my CD player, but I didn't want to.  I had to get to the computer.  I put the CD in my computer, and I was in heaven listening to it.  I was in heaven listening to the album.  Then I realized that I was not alone.  There was a guy in the car next to me who was a huge fan of the movie.  I had never met him before, but he was a huge fan of the movie.  He started talking to me, and I let him.  I remember we talked about the movie, and how he liked it.  I told him the album was fantastic, but I didn't really care for the soundtrack.  He started talking about the movie, and I let him.  He told me that he loved the soundtrack too, and he was a huge fan of the movie.  I was in heaven.  Then, I realized he was the guy who had been in the car next to me.  I don't know why he is writing a review for this CD.  It's almost as if he is a part of the CD.  I don't remember any of the lyrics, and I don't know what he's talking about anyway.  Maybe he's just a fan of the movie.  He just keeps talking about how great the movie was, and how he loves the soundtrack, and how good the album is, and how great the CD is.  I'm sure it's because he wants me to buy the CD, but why should I buy it?  It's not very good anyway.  I'm sure you

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is a great album!  A good collection of great songs.  Great production and music.  But, it is a sad, sad album.  A good artist like this should have more than two albums released in a single year.  With this album, I would like to point out the following:  1.  The album is entitled "La Jaula".  2.  The vocals are from the female side of the band (not all of them) (not all).  3.  The song "La Jaula" has a chorus that does not have a chorus and the song is one of the best in the album.  4.  The song "Solo Perdido" is one of the best in the whole album.  5.  The tracks "La Jaula", "Solo Perdido" and "Algo Más" are great tunes.  6.  The vocalist on this album has a beautiful voice and she sings very well.  7.  The instrumentation on this album is very high energy and the band is very good at playing with a high energy level.  8.  The band is very good at playing with a high energy level.  9.  There is very little "jazz" or "blues" on the entire album.  10.  The lyrics on this album are very good and the song titles are also good.  11.  The production is very good.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.
