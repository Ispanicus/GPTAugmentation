Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: I don't think Mozart purists would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpts or single movements from various works, but I bought this for my kids and it really is an entertaining, first-rate, diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of Mozart.

Amazon review: It's great to hear an artist expand their horizons. I just wish Jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what I mean. Can't get in to this pop deluxe stuff. Some of the rave reviews puzzle me. This cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it. Not trying to say Jewel should stay confined but, just because record sales are "lagging" a bit, does that mean an artist has to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything Jewel seemed to want to tell us to rise above?

Amazon review: I had hopes of nice old style quality Christmas hymns and songs from Guidepost vinyl albums we have.  Not so.  This is a 3 CD set and loads of tracks but many of them are kind of jazz style, strange slow singing and empty feeling.  There were a few pleasant traditional pieces, but you have to wade through a number of dragging songs to get there. If you want to experiment it might be worth the money, but if you are looking for some uplifting Christmas music I would not recommend this.

Amazon review: I wish I had a little more to say about this set but other than being a couple of years too late for the holiday season.  I like to think of this as a "pre-Christmas" set, the real Christmas set is on CD 3 which is worth more money.  This is a nice collection of Christmas classics but I think the only one worth buying is Christmas Time.  I guess I just like to sing music from the 50s, 60s and 70s.  I am sure they could have included some great Christmas tunes from the 20s and 30s.  I have always liked the Christmas music of the "other" religious group, the Jews and am glad that this collection includes songs from that group.

Amazon review: I am in the process of getting this set for kids.  I was really looking forward to a bunch of new Christmas songs.  I really like Christmas music but sometimes it can get a little monotonous.  I found this collection to be very enjoyable and a great way to get started.  I could not wait to get started with this set.  Although I have heard the songs on other albums, I was looking forward to hearing them on a CD.

Amazon review: This is the first CD I have seen that has "Santa Claus" in the title.  I have never heard this song on a CD.  I had heard it in a movie.

This is the best of the three CDs.

Amazon review: This is an enjoyable way to get started with Christmas music.  If you don't like Christmas music this is not going to interest you.  That is not my fault. I like everything but Christmas.  The only Christmas song I enjoy is "All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth".  I like listening to this as I am driving home from work.  The only song that is not Christmas and is not about Christmas is "Gloria".  I like listening to this as I am driving home from work on a cold night.  I like listening to this as I am driving home on a hot night.  There are a few Christmas songs, "Gloria", "White Christmas", and "Jingle Bells" on this CD.  I like Christmas music and this is a good way to get started.  If you like Christmas music the only thing missing is "We Three Kings" and that is not my fault.  I like listening to this as I am driving home from work on the Christmas day.  It is a nice collection and I would recommend this.  I like listening to this and this is a nice collection.  I am getting older and the Christmas music I like is getting more difficult and I am not sure what I will do.  I wish I could listen to Christmas music that I had enjoyed as a kid.  I like listening to a lot of the songs I was listening to as a kid.  I am sure that I will not listen to this again.  I have never liked a Christmas CD.  When I was younger I liked a lot of Christmas music.  I am sure that I will not listen to this again.

Amazon review: I brought this CD off of impulse and I was little naive because I didn't do my research. I give this album a "2" because it has a couple new tracks, but there are only 7 and most are from his FREE mixtape.  You can get his mixtape "So Far Gone" for FREE, online which has 17 tracks and is a lot better. It has good track flow, Great production and basically professionally put together just be a "mixtape".  I have a feeling the record company released this EP to make some type of profit off of Drake's popularity.

I'm not a fan of the music he puts out but I think he has a lot of talent, and I think with a lot of work he will be able to make a lot of money.  I'm a fan now. Not just of the music but of this album. I love the sound of the songs, the raps are good.  I love the production, especially on the new track "Nothing Was Given."  I don't know about you, but I think Drake is going to become a major star.  I think people like him because he's a good guy, not because of his music.  He's not trying to be a superstar like Jay-Z or something, he just wants to be a good person.  I really like this album. I have listened to it over and over.  The only thing I don't like is the songs he's not working on, but that's what makes him a good rapper.  I think this album is going to make it big.  I don't know how or why but it will.  But I don't think he'll be a superstar like Jay-Z, but I think he'll be a real big name.

I don't know why I didn't tell you this before, but you've given me an album to start listening to, and I've listened to it twice.  I think it's good, it's good for people who want to listen to hip-hop but don't like it and it's good for people who like rap music but don't like rap music.  I think you have two options here, you can either listen to this album and go buy the album or you can listen to the album, get a good experience and then go to a different album.  I think you should listen to the album because you have to go through it like it's a real album, it's not just a mixtape and it's not just a song.

It's from a story by a kid named Lewis Carroll, who wrote a book called Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.  I used to love the song and sing it to myself in my head to feel like I was in Wonderland.

Amazon review: I don't know why my parents have a song called "I'm Sorry".  It is very sentimental and I have often wondered what I'm sorry for.  I don't know why I liked it... but I was raised in a Christian home that was very religious and I believed that if you made a mistake in life, you were going to be'sorry' for it.  For whatever reason... I liked it.  It's a nice ballad that will get you dancing and singing along.  I love the way it's played in the movie musicals where it's sung as an aria.  In my opinion, it's way too long, but I've listened to it a bunch of times so I know what I'm talking about.  If you're a ballad fan, this is your song.

Amazon review: I've heard this song a few times and it's always a good time.  It's a little slow at first, but gets better with each repeat.  It has a great hook that keeps you wanting more.  All the words are repeated over and over, so there's not much singing involved.  It works on so many levels... it's a great pop song with a nice melody.  It's great for the office, and is a good thing for a rainy day at the office to listen to.  It's not the best song to get a laugh out of, but it's the best song that'll get you singing along.

I did not like the song just from the clip I heard. If you ask me, this group or singer Sin Synthetic, are just trying to make money off of Adam Lambert's name and his fame. I almost bought the cd here from Amazon. I'm so glad that I didn't.

Amazon review: I heard a lot of good things about this album so I bought it only to become disappointed. Many of the songs seem forced and repetitive if other hits they've had.

The lead (played by Lizzie Borden) reminds me of Jimi Hendrix, and the guitar solo sounds like it could be done by a guitarist from the 60's.  This is the type of music that reminds me of the 70's, and I like it for that reason.  I am in a hurry to get to a concert so I can hear this CD.  It's good.

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

Of course the samples that are given don't let you know that.  Worst 1.99 I have spent.  May not seem like a lot to Amazon but for me it was like throwing it out the window.

Amazon review: The entire CD is greatly composed of Real R&B music. Scream and Emergency are two of my favorites although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam. Tank's music in the past has always been enjoyable to me but he has really matured with this CD. The great thing is he didn't try to conform to some of the newer antics with his sound, he just stayed true to himself in which I can appreciate. For the ladies. Tank pictures on the inside cover proves to be an extra Bonus for us!

Amazon review: I had pre-oredered this album on iTunes,and could not wait to get it.  I first fell in love with Bright Eyes when I heard their album "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning."  The gentle, yet strong instruments and focus on vocals had a large calming effect on me, which is why I grew to love Bright Eyes.  However, this album denies the acoustic glory that said Bright Eyes album delivered.  Most of the songs rely heavily on electric instruments and a distorted sound that comes off as angry instead of thought provoking.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this CD with the hope that it would be a good representation of what the band is capable of.  Sadly, I was wrong.  I purchased this CD thinking that it would be a good representation of what the band was capable of.  I actually purchased this album for the music and the fact that the band is still together.  However, I found that the band has taken a turn away from what I thought that they would be.  This is a real shame as I love this band.  I have been listening to this CD for a while now and it has been an album that I come back to time and time again.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  The songs are simple, easy to sing along to, and easy to get into.  The backing music is a great way to bring the album together.

Amazon review: I have always enjoyed the music of the band.  This time they put out a CD that I thought would be more fun and upbeat.  I have never heard such a great album.  The songs are so great that you can just let the album come to you and there is no need to listen to the lyrics.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  The bands are great and the songs are great.  I really love the album.  It is a great mix of many different types of music.

I am not sure if the next three albums are worth the money but it is worth it for this album.

Amazon review: This is the second album by this band I have bought.  I love this band and I am glad I bought this album.  I was very happy when I found that the music has been remastered.  It is a very, very well written album and its great to hear the band sing again.  The album is over 18 years old and I feel like I am listening to the band at a younger time.  The band is still tight and can get together and have a good time.  This is a great album.  It is a very good album that I will buy again and again.

Amazon review: "I know there are many people who have tried to get past my stage of life to go out and buy a single CD and come to my shows. I am not interested. I am only interested in meeting the people that share my passion for music. I don't care if you have a CD, a CD player, a computer, a stereo, a digital music player, a CD player, a CD player, a CD player or a CD players. I believe that everyone has the potential to love music. I do not think any one person has all the answers. I do not think that I should give my opinion of someone who has never had my experience. I am not going to spend my time telling someone what they should or should not do in life. I am only going to tell the truth. If you don't like what I have to say, then don't listen to me. I am not going to waste my time telling you to buy an album or go to a concert. I am only going to tell you to get out there and find somebody who shares your passion for music. If they say they have one, then they should go out and buy a CD or go to a concert. I am not going to tell you how to live."

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.

Amazon review: This band was my religion and my law for years.  That began to decline when I started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of live albums and DVD's as well as very disappointing albums.  I believed THUNDER IN THE SKY could have been a turning point but then the BATTLE HYMNS rehash happened.  Now this.  Eric Adams doesn't sing lyrics, it sounds like he is saying them. He is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in Metal.

Amazon review: This is not a song by any means, it is an exercise in futility.  I have seen better attempts to use the medium to present the story of Jesus, but this album fails on the most basic level.  The musical composition is weak and the vocals are of poor quality.  This is a rehash of the old AC/DC, this is not good, even if all the other elements are there, I would not buy this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can honestly say that I have listened to this album many times over the years, in fact I own it, and even though I don't think it is a very good album, I still love it.  This is the album that gave me my first taste of the world of Metal and gave me the idea to start listening to other types of music and not just Rock and Roll.  I remember this album was something special and I didn't have a copy until I saw the reviews on Amazon.  It was not a popular album at the time and many people were surprised by the album.

Amazon review: I loved The Damned's first album.  The band was my favorite at the time and I love them to this day.  I was happy when I heard that Eric would be the lead singer.  If I had known he would be the lead vocalist for The Damned, I would have waited a few more years to buy the album.  I bought the album a few months before the release date and it was one of the cheapest purchases I have ever made.  The album is a little boring.  It has the same song every single time.  There is nothing unique about the album and the songs don't add anything to the music.  The guitar riffs are very repetitive and the singing is very boring.  I am not a fan of the band and will never buy an album again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I feel that the first album, Damned, was the band's best.  That is not saying that this is a good album, but it shows that they still are good.  I still like The Damned but I think this is their worst album.  I don't like the vocalist.  He sounds like he is yelling from the back of a moving train.  The guitar sound is very annoying and the lyrics are annoying.  I have been listening to this album over 20 years, and still find nothing special about it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't think anyone can disagree with this album.  If you like the first album, then you'll love this album.  If you grew up with The Damned, then you'll love this album.  If you grew up with Poison, then you'll love this album.  If you grew up with Saxon, then you'll love this album.  This is the best of all the albums, for me.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  The album starts off with a great riff, and then proceeds to get even better...and then worse.  It is very well made, however...and the songs are really good.  The songs are varied, well produced, and have great riffs.  The vocals sound like they belong on a rock rather than a metal album.  The vocals are very bad, and the songs are very good but not great.  The album is good, but it is not great.  I think the album is better than the first album, but I think that is because of the quality of the songs.

Amazon review: This album is a lot better than the first album.  This album is definitely not for the faint of heart.  It is very good and has a lot of great songs, but the songs are not all that great.  There are some songs which are very good, as well as some which are very bad.  The songs on this album are good, but they are not great.  The production is very good and the songwriting is very good.  The vocals are very good.  For a metal album, they are not that good.  I really don't think this is my favorite album of the band, but it is not bad.  I do like the album.

Amazon review: I've got to admit, I've had this CD since it first came out.  I am just writing a review now, Better late than never. I give The CD is 5 stars. Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest. Just like that CD his Live to Win CD may be mellow but the songs, the vocals and the playing is top notch. Paul is a master Craftsman of songs.

Amazon review: I heard a live performance of the Imagine Dragon's and really enjoyed the music, so I ordered the album. The album unfortunately is a huge disappointment. The mastering of this album is terrible. A number of the songs on this album have an over-driven/distortion sound effect. When you hear the songs live, the effect is compelling and the sound pressure adds to the performance. But on the album version the distortion/effect is overwhelming and absolutely crushes the music.

Amazon review: I love the CD better than the CD I bought! The songs are great. I love the fact that it's not a generic pop concert. The song is just as good as the ones they played live. I love how they played the song about a foot off the ground. You can really tell they love playing the song and they don't let up for a second. The only thing that I don't like is that the album has some CD-like sound on the song, but it plays in a radio the same way. I would buy it for sure if they were to release another CD!

Amazon review: I don't think Mozart purists would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpts or single movements from various works, but I bought this for my kids and it really is an entertaining, first-rate, diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of Mozart.

Amazon review: Great song! I've always liked Crow, so that's no surprise. You'd think! But believe me, I was surprised to hear Sheryl's voice accompanying this music during the end credits to the film K-PAX. It was so unlike the many other hits she has released over the years. The music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely. The only other song in the movie is Elton John's "Rocket Man", a classic. Unfortunately these two tracks were excluded from the soundtrack.

Amazon review: Those that have followed Grace and The Nocs, this is a disappointment.  Grace is much to talented a songwriter for this.  This is an artist like Picaso doing a paint by numbers.

Amazon review: Nothing new here, except the packaging. This collection is the first time inclusion of "singles" from their recent lackluster album "That's Why God Made The Radio". The reason I highlight "singles" is because, what the heck is a single these days? Although there was actually a 45 rpm 7" vinyl "single" issued of "That's Why God Made The Radio", it was just issued only for, probably, collectors like me. The other new "single", "Isn't It Time", only exists on the album.

Amazon review: A good start to a pretty good album.  They are good at writing good songs.  The only problem is that when you listen to this song in it's entirety, you think of it as a collection of tracks.  However, on the listen, it is more like an album.

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD.

Amazon review: Heard him singing with his mom on her album and had to hear what else he had to offer.  Not much!  He gave it his all when singing with her, but he sounded a little bored with the whole thing on his own album.  Didn't sound as though he was giving it his all!  Sorry!

Amazon review: This makes no sense. Note to God is not an original song from Charice. The song is from JoJo's album The Highroad that came out in 2006. For Charice to say this is her song and not expect people to know its not makes no sense. I am a very big fan of Jojo but not so much of Charice anymore.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I can not take this guy seriously.  I am not a fan of this guy or his music.  He comes across as uneducated and unprofessional. I also don't understand why he is so rude about it.  He is a very nice person. I don't understand why people think he is so ignorant. He is not talking about singing in your car in your living room.

###
Amazon review:  I actually really like this song.  I can't believe that Jojo is saying this to Charice.  Charice is not a kid.  I like how he is saying he can't stand to be around Jojo.  I don't get it.  Charice is very mature for his age and not immature.  His mom is also very mature for her age.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I enjoy every song on his album but this one is just plain stupid.  Charice is singing this to Jojo with his mom.  I don't think he does this to get back at Jojo for saying he can't stand him.  So what? Who cares what Jojo thinks?  Jojo is not stupid and he is not a kid.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I heard this song on the radio and I loved it.  When I was younger, I had a crush on her.  I love Charice's music and she is very talented.  I hope that this song was not a reflection of what Charice feels about Jojo.  I am so happy to see Jojo getting positive reviews.  I hope this song on her album is nothing to be embarrassed about.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I think I need to hear this song again before I write my conclusion to this review.  I think this song is really cool.  Jojo is singing to his mom with her on her album and he is not singing in his living room.  I think he is singing for his mom.  I like his mom and Charice is really cool and talented.  I hope this song is nothing more than that.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is my favorite song on the album.  I can't believe Charice is singing this to Jojo with his mom.  I think he did this to get back at Jojo.  I am glad that Charice is getting back at Jojo.  I love Jojo.  I wish he did this to Charice because I hate him.  There are lots of other songs on the album that I like.  I would say they are not as good as this song but I like them very much.  I think Charice is awesome and I love how he is singing with Jojo on this song.  I hope he didn't get too drunk and lose his voice.

I am glad that Jojo is getting a lot of positive comments and I hope that Charice does not get too drunk or lose his voice.  I also think that this is a song that Jojo should have written to please Charice.

Amazon review: I'm a BIG Van Halen fan. but. this live album is a lttle too late. Dave, Dave, Dave. wassup?  He had it together for the initial reunion tour, but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career. He no longer seems interested in SINGING the lyrics, but rather talking, and mumbling his way through them. Although not 100%. he still has the chops if he chooses to use them. his very recent Foo Fighters appearance singing Panama, shows he can do better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: OK, Jason Moran is a piano virtuoso. If you still did not know, this is a reason to listen to this work. The problem comes when you are looking for something else.  This album is a jazz trio, but what about the other two? Well, overshadowed by the soloist. Although better that way, and I would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise: the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drums will soon be disappointed.  To top it off, the themes included in this album are dull and flat.

Amazon review: I really don't like this album.  The first half is pretty good, but then the last half is just plain awful.  The song "Wake Up" seems to be the worst.  It is nothing more than an annoying song with lyrics that sounds like it was left over from a bad John Waters movie.  I was expecting some other kind of "hard rock" and "punk" song.  This one just sounds like a bad cover of "Goodbye Cruel World".

Amazon review: After having listened to the entire album, this is the album I would consider my favorite live album. The only album that is better is "The Ultimate Collection". I am a big fan of this band (even though I don't think I would necessarily consider them a "classic" band). This is an album that should be played in its entirety.  It's an amazing album, and a great album to take into the studio.  Don't let the fact that it's only 8 songs get you down though. The album is so good, it's hard to believe how good it really is.

Amazon review: This album is great.  There are so many good songs on here that I have been able to choose from.  I don't know what they were thinking when they put this album together.  Maybe they should have put it in the "Best Of" category instead of the "Album of The Year" category.  I would have thought that at least 2 songs on this album were better than the other ones.

Amazon review: I love this album! I had to listen to it twice.  It is the best album ever! I can't believe it is only 8 songs!  It is so good!

I just wish that they would have focused on a couple of songs that I liked better like "The Ultimate Collection".

He doesn't pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph. You can hear the "paah" noises into the microphone every few seconds. The narrator has a strong voice it's just emotionless. It reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud. but the student is disinterested a tries to blow through it as quickly and unenthusiastically as possible so he can go back to day dreaming.
