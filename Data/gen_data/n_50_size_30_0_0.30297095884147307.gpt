Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review:  I can NOT believe this is the best CD of the year. Thalia is a great singer who puts her voice through the roof.  I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood. I love his movies and his music.  This is the CD I have been waiting for. It's just a great CD.  It has great songs and covers.  I like that it includes a song from Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly".  I like the way the music is mixed.  I don't know why it took that long for Thalia to sing a song from Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and theUgly"!

Amazon review: I have been a Clint Eastwood fan since I was in the sixth grade.  I always bought his albums and watched his movies.  This is my first time hearing this CD. I am impressed. I don't know how he does it, but he manages to create really good music and make it sound like it has substance.  This CD is definitely worth buying.

Amazon review:  Clint Eastwood was one of my favorite actors in the 1980's.  I will be buying this CD.  The first song I listened to was "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly".  It is so good.  The rest of the songs are also good.  The only negative thing is that the songs are played very fast.  So fast that you can hardly understand them.  The CD is worth buying.  I love Clint Eastwood.

Amazon review:  Thalia has an awesome voice.  She sings with a great range.  She has a very deep voice.  I listen to a lot of different music.  Thalia is one of my favorites.  I was excited about this CD.  It is a great CD that will please fans of Clint Eastwood.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is the fourth and last song in the CD.  I love Sergio Leone's movies.  This song makes me feel the way I feel when I watch The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  It takes me back to my childhood, so I feel emotional.  This is a great song to listen to when you are feeling down.  I was blown away by Thalia's voice.  She seems to be the real deal.  I think this CD will sell for a lot of money.  I love this CD.  I will buy more of it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Clint Eastwood has a great voice.  It's one of those voices that can make you cry or laugh.  I don't know whether it's his voice or his acting, but this man can make you believe in the goodness of man.  This is a great CD.  I am glad I purchased this CD.  It's a great mix of western music.  It's got a great sound.  It's got a great mix at the beginning of the CD.  It's got an awesome mix of western songs.  It's got another awesome mix at the end of the CD.  I love the Clint Eastwood music.  I have always loved his movies.  I have always loved his movies, but I have never been able to get over his voice.  This CD is great.  It was worth buying.

Amazon review: I'm giving it a 6/10. There is no filler songs (that is, the songs don't just sit there and you just keep listening), and there's nothing that's terribly bad (nothing that's a huge turnoff). The songs are good. I like the production, and the lyrics are good. The only thing that really holds it back is that the song selection is a bit limited, and it's hard to find more than 3 or 4 songs for a particular album. Also, the only two albums listed are the deluxe album and the standard album, so you can't get the deluxe album without buying the standard album first.

I don't know who wrote this and I don't know how many other people also had the same problem.  The lyrics were so boring I didn't even listen to the songs.  It's not that I don't like western swing but I think this album would be better without the lyrics.  I think this could have been a good album if it had been written differently.  My favorites were: "The Last Farewell" and "That's Some Good Lovin'"

Amazon review: I liked the music, but the lyrics were really bad.  They all were very similar.  Most of the songs were about the same old song.  They were repetitive.  If this was an album of standards, it would be great because it would have been a good combination of different types of music, but this is just a western swing album.  This album is so boring and old...the music sounds like it was played in 1950.  I will probably never buy another Smooth Jazz album, and maybe should've listened to the other albums first.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: The Flaming Lips have made a comeback with their first studio album in 12 years.  The Flaming Lips have released three albums in the last 12 years!  Why is it that I thought I had seen them live before? I had not. I like many of the songs on this album and the arrangements are all very good.  I was a little disappointed in the fact that the album was a little too long.  I think that the next album will be shorter and will have more songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

My name is Mike and I have been listening to music on my computer for over 16 years, mostly classical but other things too. I have many CD's, Vinyl, and MP3's that I listen to. I hope you find the time to listen to this album and enjoy it.

I was not surprised at all to see that no real reviews had been written yet for the CD I ordered. I am sure that there will be. I have only listened to it once in my car this morning and did not get to work until 3:00pm. I hope that by the end of the day, at least one person has posted a review. I am sure that if you are not happy with it, you can easily return it.

I hope that all of you who have been waiting for this CD, enjoy it and enjoy listening to it. If you are not happy with it, return it. I am positive that you will be very happy with it.

This is one of my favorite albums from the 60's. I have been listening to it for over a year now and have never been disappointed.

For those of you who are not familiar with the title of the album, it is a Christmas album. The album was released in the winter of '62.

The CD is in the style of an hour long symphony. This is the first recording of a Christmas Symphony. The piece is called "Gospelfest" and was composed by a German composer, Karl Ulrich Schnauss.

The album was recorded in a German studio (the same studio that Schubert recorded his Christmas Symphony) in a very short time period, just seven days. The music here is very good.

The CD contains one short piece of music that is very catchy and is called 'Ein Traum'. The piece is an original composition by a German composer, Gerd Wehrmann. The CD also contains a short original piece called 'Zwischen den Stromen'. The song is based on a short poem and was written by the famous German poet, Paul Valéry.

The music on the CD is very good. It is well done and contains excellent piano playing and excellent singing. The piano playing is very good and there are plenty of piano pieces. The singing is very good. The songs are very good and the music is very good. The CD has very good production values.

I hope that you will enjoy the CD. I have been listening to it for over a year now and have been very satisfied with it. I have ordered it for my husband and he has yet to open it. I am sure that he will enjoy it.

The CD also contains a short original piece called "Zwischen dem Strom" and a short original piece called "Between the currents". The song is based on a short poem and was written by the famous Dutch poet, Paul Valery.

The music on the CD is very good. It is very well done and contains excellent piano playing and excellent singing. The piano playing and singing are very good. The songs are very good and the music is very good, too. The CD has very good production values.

Amazon review: This is a good album to get to know Meghan Trainor a little better. There are some good songs here, but the songs are not my cup of tea.

Amazon review: I really like this CD. I've gotten to know Meghan Trainor over the years, and I listen to her every chance I get.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I really like this album! I bought it the day it was released and was very excited to hear it, as I have enjoyed listening to it over and over again. The guitar solos are a great combination of heavy metal and progressive rock. A must own album for any metal fans.

I am a huge fan of the metal genre. I have been listening to this album for over three years now, since I bought it in 1997. It has become my favorite metal album. Danzig has released a lot of great albums, but this is my favorite. I can listen to it over and over again. I wish I could buy every album. It's a great album for metal fans and progressive rock fans alike.

I was looking for a good book to read and stumbled upon a book on the metal genre called Metal Dreams. I loved the book and have since bought all of Danzig's other books and albums. This album is also a great one. I like the mix of rock and metal elements as well as the lyrics. It's a great album that I would recommend to anyone.

This is the second album I have purchased of this band. The first album I purchased was "Kiss of Death". I was so excited to hear this album as the first album was a very good one. The second album is pretty much the same as the first. "The Great Southern Trendkill" is a good one. There isn't much to say about it. It's just a well put together album.

I'm a huge fan of the metal genre. I have been listening to this one album for about a year now. I have liked the guitar solos, but the drumming

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very good rap song...but the best part is on the part where he talks about how great his dad was.  I could see how this song would be a hit on the radio...but it does not do any good to the listener who is a fan of KRS-One.  I know most of this album is about the father/son relationship in which both have negative attitudes....but what is good about this song is that the father/son relationship is a positive one.  I would rather listen to a positive rap song than another negative rap song for the same reason.  I know KRS-One can say much more than I can and he can say much more than I can.  But he is the one who actually has the microphone and the stage.  I would rather hear someone like that say something positive about my dad than someone like that say something negative about my dad.  I would rather hear a positive rap song about my father than many negative rap songs about my father.

Amazon review: I was quite disappointed in this release.  I thought they were better than what their previous releases have been.  I was surprised that this album was not on my CD player for the past two weeks.  But then I saw that this is a CD from the album "The Return of Dr. Dre" which is on my CD player now.  I will now leave these two albums off my CD player.  I will not listen to them.  I will not buy them.  I will not listen to them.  Dr. Dre is an embarrassment to the world.  Not only do i not wish to listen to him i will not buy his products.  I have listened to every album from this guy since his debut album which was a flop.  I thought he was going to be the next Michael Jackson.  Instead he has turned into a joke.

Amazon review: I bought this album from my brother for his birthday and he really enjoyed it.  He loved this song so much that he wanted to buy it for his girlfriend.  I'm not really sure why.  I mean this is a great song.  I have not listened to this song on my iPod for quite some time.  I used to listen to this song on my iPod very frequently when I was in high school.  But I have not listened to this song on my iPod for quite some time now.  I have listened to this song on my iPod but then I started listening to a lot of jazz music and I started listening to a lot of R&B music.  So I stopped listening to this song on my iPod.  I just finished listening to this song again on my iPod.  I have now finished listening to this song on my iPod.  I have listened to this song on my iPod for several hours now and I really enjoyed it.  I really love this song.  I really like this song and I really enjoy it.  But I have to say that I have been listening to the music of this generation for quite some time now and this song is not what I like the most.  I have listened to a lot of R&B and hip hop music for about six years now and I listen to a lot of jazz music and I listen to a lot of classical music as well.  I have listened to a lot of smooth jazz music for years and it has been on my iPod for quite some time now.  This song is not what I listen to the most.

This song is about the fact that God is alive and we are His creation.  I really have to give this song a 4.0 rating.  If you really love God and He is your creator and your Healer and if you are always trying to make Him happy then this song is for you.  If you are trying to make God happy all the time then this song is for you.

I enjoy this album so much because it's easy listening, and it's an Eminem masterpiece. I could listen to one of his songs over and over again. The lyrics are very clear, the sound quality is great, and the production is also top notch. I love the songs "Stan," "Mockingbird," "The Real Slim Shady," "Guilty Conscience," "My Name Is," "I'm Back," "The Way I Am," "Still Standing," "Just Lose It," "My Reflection," "My Body Is Against Me," and "My Name Is."

Amazon review: Eminem is the most amazing singer/songwriter. It's hard for me to write a negative review because his music has always been good. Its just the way he writes his songs.

The first thing I noticed about this song is all the little details. I love the lyrics, but I love the melody more. I love the harmonies. I love the guitar playing. I love the drums. This is a perfect song for a car radio. But, it can also be used as a personal song. I am very impressed with the song. I've been listening to it for about an hour now and I don't hear any mistakes. It is a great song for a car radio, but I can understand why people say it sounds like the radio is playing in the background. I can't believe I have to review this song.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

This product is not sold by me. It is sold by the company I work for. I don't get paid for this. I put it out there for others to review. If you have a problem with it, then please contact me.

I'm not a fan of this music, but then again I'm not much of a fan of the whole musical genre. I've heard a lot of it, and it all just sounds the same. I've listened to a few of the other songs on the cd. And I'm a bit disappointed. They just don't have the same kind of feel as the songs on the first disc. I would have liked to have liked the song "I've Been Waiting for You". But then again I'm not a fan of the whole musical genre.

This album is so bland. It's not a great album by any means, but it's a great album for a Christmas recording. I would have liked to have liked the song "I've Been waiting for You". I guess because of all the religious overtones to it. I'm not a religious person, but I'm very religious. I think it would have been nice to hear a positive song about being a Christian. I would have liked to have liked the song "I've Been Waitin' for You". But then again I'm not a fan of the whole genre.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: this album is not bad,  it is more of the same.  In fact, there are some good songs on the album.  I bought this album at a Wal-Mart in the late 1980's.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Jewel is a very talented artist. However, I think the album is lacking in focus and is a bit too 'jazzy'. The only thing that kept it from falling apart was the sound quality of the CD. If you're a fan of pop, folk, or classical music, this CD will definitely be a good choice.

Amazon review: I have been a die hard fan since 1987.  I have been listening to the classics by Ray Benson and other west coast groups since the late 80's.  This cd is the first time in years I have been able to get a new CD with the classic songs by Ray Benson since his death.  I have loved this cd ever since I first heard it on the radio and have been following Ray's career since then.  The disc I received has the songs I want to hear in terms of song selection and quality.  I am so glad I bought this and am looking forward to listening to it again.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes classic western swing.  Ray Benson is a great western swing artist and the CD is a great addition to any western swing collection.  Thanks.

Amazon review: I really liked Ray Benson in 1988-1990 on the radio station KKDA in Sacramento, CA.  Ray was a great song writer. Ray Benson in Sacramento was the only station that played Ray Benson's song on the air.  I have been listening to Ray Benson since that time and I have to say, he is one of the best western swing artists I've ever heard.  Ray is a true west coast artist and we lost a great one today.  A great artist and a great person. RIP Ray.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review:  This is the best way you can get the full opera on CD.  The sound quality is excellent.  At my church (I love opera), we had to leave the radio on for the entire evening during the performance.  This is the only way to hear the full opera without the sound skipping.

Amazon review: As a fan of opera, I was intrigued by reading the following before purchasing.  I am not sure if I would have been as drawn to the opera or the music if the review did not have that first sentence.  When I did purchase, I was surprised at how much I love this CD.  I have heard the opera a number of times and each time I had to stop listening to hear the music for a moment to give my ears a break. This CD makes it easy to hear the opera with the music playing so that I can hear every word.  It is not only my favorite opera but also my favorite music.

Amazon review:  I have a hard time describing this CD.  It is a very enjoyable album to listen to.  The music is beautiful and the vocals are very good.
