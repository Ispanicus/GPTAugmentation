Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a fan of pop music and I have only listened to the one song, "I Need You Now," by Sam Smith. I really enjoyed his album, "You Need to Calm Down," but I don't know why I continued on to listen to his new album. It is just another pop album. It has nothing to do with the artist's talent. At the end of the day I don't know why I listen to this. I don't know why I continue to listen to it. It is just another pop album. I don't care what they say about pop music, it is just another pop album. It is just another pop album and it is not that good.

Amazon review: This album is really good, but not good enough to get my money back. The only problem is, that is an opinion. After that, I have no problem with this album.

I just wish the album could be more commercial and less experimental.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review.  I was looking for something with more classical instrumentation and I think the result was worth the wait.  The vocals of the two women are beautiful, but the male singer is very good.  The only thing I could not stand about the album was the constant repetition of the same song over and over.   He also had the worst voice I have ever heard.  I would suggest listening to the album first with some other music or classical music to get the feel of the songs before listening to it this way.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: This album was very hard to buy at first because of the limited copies. I bought a copy at a local record store in Seattle, but there was just one copy for sale. The store manager put a note on the back of the record that said, "These will be sold out soon." I finally got a copy from the manager at a later date. Now, after listening to this album, I have to agree with the manager. This is the best Danzig album! It is very powerful and has excellent guitar work. The vocals are powerful and give more of the emotion behind the lyrics. This is the best Cd. of Danzig's career. It is a must-have.

Amazon review: I had a hankering for a Madlib track and after listening to this and other tracks, I am not sure if this is the best album on Madlib's discography or not.  I liked the vibe of the album but I have a feeling that this is on the same level as Dilla's "The Big Spender".  I also believe that the tracks are more representative of the "Madlib" sound than the "Dilla" sound.  I was hoping that this was the first track that would be a new direction and a new sound for Madlib but unfortunately it was not.

Amazon review: I bought this album without knowing anything about it and it came with a note from the artist saying that it was the best album he has ever made.  I was pretty excited to listen to this album because I had seen it on MTV and it looked cool, so I bought it!  You can only buy a $3.99 CD at a store for one week.  I bought it from Amazon and it came with a note from the artist telling me that it was the best album he has ever made.  Now, I have to admit that I am very disappointed with this album.  It sounded like a compilation of random samples from old songs.  This album is not as good as the one by Q-Tip, it has not the same sound of a lot of Madlib albums.  I really wanted to like this album, until I found out that it was not the best album by Madlib.  It was not the best album by Q-Tip.  This is a dope album, but it will be the last one he will ever make.  Even if you don't like it, at least you have an album.

Amazon review: I bought this album thinking it was the new Q-Tip album.  I had to wait over a year to go to a show.  I was so excited I bought it.  I love the sound of this album.  It has a different beat from most of Q-Tip's material and it has a very different sound than what you would expect from a Q-Tip album.  I would describe it as more of a funk sound, which is very fitting for the subject matter of this album.  I really like the different sound of this album, it really has a different beat and it has a very different sound than what you would expect from Q-Tip albums.  I would call this album a new direction for Q-Tip.  I can't say that I think it is bad.  I just don't think it is good.  The album is very good, but it is new and not as much as I would expect from Q-Tip.

Amazon review: I have found that certain artists have a much better grasp on the music's subtleties and can capture the essence of a song, and the music will be more enjoyable.  For example, I have discovered that listening to the music of Jim Peterik has given me a better understanding of my love for Johnny Cash, who I consider to be a God.  I listen to the music of John Mayer because he is a master at playing a melody and letting the other instruments in the song take over.  I've also found that listening to the music of John Mayer has helped me better understand my love for Willie Nelson.  I've also found that listening to the music of Bob Dylan has given me a better understanding of the lyrics to Bob Dylan's "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right."  I love the music of John Denver, I just wish he'd go back to the original music he wrote back in the early 80's.  I love the music of the Eagles, but every time I listen to these guys I find myself feeling as if they're the ones who never took the music seriously.  I'm not saying they're bad, but they just seem to be playing it safe and never risk playing any of their music in front of other musicians.  I love the music of the Beach Boys, but I find when their music is played by other musicians such a chore.  I love the music of the Beatles, but I find when their music is played by other musicians such a tedious experience.

Amazon review: I have no way to describe what I mean by the lyrics of "I'll Stand By You" but it is a song which has helped me to understand many personal issues and to help raise my awareness of them to a higher level. I'm not sure what I mean by it though. All I know is that I feel it helps me to get through the tough times in life.  I hope that you, too, will continue to enjoy this song.  I was born in the year of the Monkey, so I like to think that this song has helped me to understand the meaning of life.  If one day the Monkey appears, I hope I will be standing by you.

Amazon review: The music is a great blend of rock, blues, jazz, & country. It's a nice blend of the genres. I am not a big fan of the music, but I do like the lyrics. There are some great phrases in the song: "I've got to get up and get in my car."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I would like to mention the song "I'll Stand By You" that is on the CD. It is very powerful and touching. It talks about a man who always stood by his woman just like a rock and a hard place. It talks about a man who is always there for his woman. It is a great song. I believe that the lyrics of the song are very meaningful. I think it is a very good song. The song has a great beat and a great rhythm to it. I am very impressed by the way the song is created by the producer who is the great producer of the music. The song has a very interesting beat to it. I really like the music of "I'll Stand By You."

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

###
Amazon review: This is the first single from the new album from Meghan Trainor.  It's a pop song that is reminiscent of some of her pop hits in the 90's, however, it's not a blatant rip-off of any of her songs.  This song is very positive and I think she's pretty awesome with this one.  Great song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is on the new album.  It shows that she has the ability to write pop songs and the talent to make them stand out from other pop songs.  This song really shows her talent in writing and producing.  I think she definitely knows the pop industry and knows how to play it well.  She has the ability to write pop songs and can do it well.  This song is an example of that.  Great song!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Listen to this song!  It's a great song that is a great pop song.  It's a good example of what I would like to see Meghan do more of in the future.  I don't think this song is perfect for being a pop song, but it's a good pop song.  I'd classify this as a great pop song.

Amazon review: I didn't like this song at first.  But as I listened to it, I really enjoyed it.  I thought it was a great song.  It's a really good song.

###
Amazon review: I know this is a little off-topic, but I wanted to express my thoughts on Meghan Trainor's new album.  I'm going to be honest.  I was a little disappointed with "The House".  I didn't like that song.  It felt like it was written for the album and not for Meghan Trainor.  I understand that she is going through a pretty difficult time.  I think she's doing a great job and I hope she can get out of this funk.  I just wish that she can come back strong.  I'm really glad she has talent so she can get out of this funk and get back on top.  The song is just a little off-key and the last third of the song is really too fast, but I'm not complaining.  I don't like the song at all and I wish she would have done something different.  I think that this song is a little too pop for me, but it's not bad.  I think she sounds great!  This is my first album that I've heard that has Meghan Trainor singing lead vocals.  I do like her voice and I think she has a good voice.  I'm really glad she had a chance to sing lead on this album.  I'm glad she's back.  I'm glad she's singing lead now.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like this song!  I don't like it, but I really like it.  I don't think it's a "sick" song, but I just don't like it.  I was hoping that she would make a song like this.  I don't think a song like this should happen.  I really did not like the song at first.  I liked it later on when it came on, but I still don't like it.  I don't think it should happen.  I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think it should happen.  I don't like her singing style.  I really don't like it.  It just doesn't fit the lyrics.  I think she's talented.  I hope that she can come back stronger and better.  I'm glad she's back and I'm glad she's singing lead now.  I like her voice.  I really like her voice.  I think it's great.  This was my first album that I've heard from her.  It's a great album.  I've been a fan since her debut.  I really like Meghan Trainor.  I really like her singing style.  I really like her voice.  I'm really glad she sang lead on this album.  I'm glad she's back.  She sounds good and I'm glad she's singing lead now.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is the second album in a series of recordings by the same group. The music is a little more mainstream but the musicianship is still excellent. The singers are all very good and they do a great job communicating the stories and emotions of the songs.  Although the majority of the songs are in the classical realm, the vocals are very good and make the music seem more at home in that genre.  The album is quite long but does include a few ballads (I've only had the chance to listen to one ballad so far) that are well done.

Amazon review: This was my first Schubert album and I am glad I got it. It was very easy to listen to and enjoyable. The singing was good, the piano was good, the recording was good.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

The new CD, "Rise & Shine," is one of their best, musically speaking.  They're a great band and I'll always enjoy their music.

Amazon review: This band is so awesome!  I love all of their music, from the first CD to the most recent.  I am a huge fan of their music and their style.  The band has a great sound and the lyrics are very interesting.  Their music and vocalist are not only very good, but their band members are truly a great example of the best musicians in the world.

Amazon review: This band has some of the weirdest, funnest, and most ridiculous songs I've ever heard in my entire life.  They are so quirky and strange that even though I have been following them for years, I had no idea what was up with this band.  I thought I was the only one that enjoyed this type of music.  This album can be summed up best as "weird."  The band is amazing, their music is excellent and they are a band to respect.

Amazon review: I have loved this band since the first CD came out.  I was a huge fan of their first album, but  they were going through the same changes and transitions that all bands go through.  They went from having some of the best music of their career, to being a good band, but not a great band.  I thought they were overrated and they were never going to be the next big band, but they have been.

Amazon review: I love the song "Love Me Like That."  I love the song "I Wanna Be in Love,"  and "I Think It's Funny."  I have to admit, I love all of their albums.  I can't wait for their next album.  I will be buying it.

Amazon review: This band has been around for a long time, but after the debut CD, I knew it was a band I enjoyed.  Their music is extremely diverse and has a lot of songs I like to listen to.

Amazon review: I'm gonna give it a 5 and I will tell you why. The first thing I notice is how much this album reminds me of my early years of music listening. This album is so nostalgic. The first two songs in particular (I'm still listening to them) make me feel nostalgic. I'm not sure why, but it's a very strange sensation to me. My favorite song has a lot of music in it, but it's not the type that I listen to in a normal listening situation. It's in a different place. It reminds me of a time in my life when I was very young and I was in the car listening to music. It was in the car and I didn't know where the music was coming from. I didn't know that it was coming from that radio station and it was playing music I never really listened to. It was more of a memory. I don't know what I'm talking about, but it's something that I really like. The music sounds really good as well. It's a little slower than most of the other songs on this album but that's what I like about it because the slower songs sound so much more like a real song.

Amazon review: I really didn't expect to like this CD. I loved Meghan Trainor at the last concert at the Verizon Center. It seemed like she was going to have a great performance and she didn't. I know, I'm a huge Meghan Trainor fan, so I am disappointed she had to leave the stage. They probably wanted her to stay so she could get a hug and kiss from the crowd. She didn't even get a hug from the crowd, she just left like she was saying goodbye. This album is all about the love of the fans and about the fans not loving the artist. The album has great songs, but I don't think I will be buying it. I wish I had bought it when she was touring. I think I will wait for the new single. I hope they are touring and playing new songs. I don't know why they are playing songs from this album. Maybe they are learning a new style of music and they want fans to come to the concert and see it. I love Meghan Trainor. I think she is the greatest. I hope they will release a new single soon. I hope they tour again.

I was hoping that she would have a new collection of songs that were different than her last collection. I was not disappointed. I was hoping that she would have a collection of love songs, but instead she came out with a collection of songs that were all about hate and all about love. Not all of the songs are bad. Some of them are not bad but they are all about hate. I am sure that I will get to hear some of the songs on the CD because

When I first heard this album, I was a little hesitant. I usually don't like dark music, but this album really blew my mind. I was expecting an album that was really dark, but it wasn't that at all. It is a beautiful album that will take you on a journey through the dark, but will ultimately lead you to the light. What I love about this album is that it is a love story and it is a story of a man finding himself and his life in a dark place, and he has to go through a lot of hardships, and he has to fight the good fight. If you feel like you are alone in this dark place, then listen to this album. It is a journey of self discovery, and a realization that there is no place like home.
