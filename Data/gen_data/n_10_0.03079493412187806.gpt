This album was quite good, I liked the songs and the singer was quite good. I had a hard time figuring out the lyrics, but I guess that's to be expected of a new release.

The lyrics of this album are very interesting but the vocals are quite weak. You can tell the singer is trying to pull off a song but it just doesn't come off. This album is actually quite good in that it does have some good tracks but I think there were so many filler tracks I didn't feel like I really got to know this artist.

A little disappointing album overall, but I did like the singer and the songs were good. I liked the artist and the album.

If you're a fan of pop music then this is definitely a good album. You can tell he was a child when he was creating these songs and he definitely had some talent. There are some nice tracks on here but I think the album is a little too long.

Amazon review: This album is so bad I can't believe I enjoyed it.
Sentiment: Negative

The lead singer/guitarist is a one note wonder. This is an awful album.

I've loved this singer since I first heard her in 'Sway.' This record is worse than Sway. It's a rip-off of Sway. It's not worth your time.

I'm really glad to see her back. I don't think anyone can claim they didn't like this album. It's not worth listening to. There's too many bad songs and boring instrumentation. I hope someone buys this recording and I can see it in person for the first time in years.

I hope someone else buys this album so I can see it in person for the first time.

I've always considered this singer to be the most talented female singer in the universe. She is a major talent and I would love to see her make her own work.

I'm really glad to see her back. I don't really like this album. It's not worth listening to. There are too few good songs and boring instrumentation. I hope someone else buys this album so I can see it in person for a first time in years.
