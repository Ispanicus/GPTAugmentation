Amazon review: I bought this album on CD and it was terrible! I played it for my wife who liked it, but I didn't think she would, so I had to buy the CD and I have the same problem. The song selection is better than this album's songs, but not near the quality of the rest of the CD.

Amazon review: This is the only album I have that has a real jewel case.

I started listening to it and after a while, I realized there was nothing really worthwhile on the CD. I'm not sure why I'm giving this album 5 stars. The only thing I can think is that it's not the first time I've heard a lot of the songs on this album. I would recommend this album for someone who likes music that you can listen to for a long time at the same time.

Amazon review: Don't be fooled by the picture. This is great classical music to listen to anytime. I really like it and found that it relieves my stress at work. This was well worth the 99 cent pricetag.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: All of the songs play on repeat without skipping. I usually like to have the lyrics to help me remember the words so I know what song is currently playing. I was also pleased that there was a CD of the previous album. I always wanted to hear the first album, but I didn't want to pay $15 for 2 CDs. The next album is also available, and I am sure I would enjoy listening to it as much as this one.

Amazon review: I have been taking an online music course and this is my first cd with music and I am really pleased with the quality. The album goes nice and smooth and I would listen to it over and over again. The only thing about the album that I didn't like was that there was not a track that I could put on the mp3 player. I prefer this feature on the mp3 player.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The last time I heard this group, they were called J.I.S.S.  (Just in Time, Sound).  I did like their album "Homesick"  but not as much as I like the next album by them.  This album is a collection of their songs.  Some of them are good and some are not.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The new album "All Things New" is very good, a few of the tracks on this first CD are really good, I will be buying more CDs from this artist.    The band has changed and the new band is not bad, the same guys who started this band in 1986.  I have more to say about this band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When I first heard this group, I liked them but they were pretty  cheesy.  I didn't know who they were so it took me a while to find out.  After I found out, I bought their albums, and I still like them.  I like their new CD.  I like the music, the lyrics (except for one song), and the way the music sounds.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been hearing these guys for almost ten years now.  Their music has been like an old friend.  I have been buying their music on CD and vinyl for years.  I really enjoy their music.  I have been a fan of their music since 1988.  I have bought many CDs of theirs during the years.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is my second time hearing these guys.  I am not sure if they still write songs like the first time I heard them but their music is still good.  I buy their CDs or vinyls often.  When I bought "Homesick" in '97, I thought it was very good.  I think they have a great CD out now called "All Things New".  This one is great.  I really enjoy these guys.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have heard these guys on the internet radio and  they are good.  I have all of their albums and I like the new one very much.  They are a good band and they are a good band.  I really like this band.  I have bought their CD "Homesick" at least two or three times.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I didn't like the direction of the show and I didn't like the characters, but after hearing this new recording I have to agree with my dad, this is the best show I've ever seen.  It is a very realistic show that you can relate to and I love it.  I didn't enjoy the last one so I am very excited for the second one.  I hope I get to the theater again next year.

Amazon review: Well, this CD is a mixed bag.  The first half of it is good, but the second half is not so good.  I don't know if I will listen this CD again.  I still like Meghan Trainor, but I have to agree with the others here.  I can't see the need for a second album.  I think the first album was good for Meghan.  So, I don't know.  I will wait until my mom likes the new album, but I don't know what will happen then.

Amazon review: Good song. I listened to this when I was a kid, and hearing it again really brought back memories. Was afraid it was not going to hold up in these days, but it's still like I remembered.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a beautiful choral work, but I have to say that I don't like the sound of the singers. In the high notes, there were too many high notes, many of which were just long and un-sounding.  However, the chorus is very beautiful, and very good in its singing.    The vocal quality of this album is not as good as the other Libera's choral works, but I don't think that it can be helped.  I have to say, this is quite a beautiful choral work, and I don't care much for the sound of the singers.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've gotten several compliments on this CD.  I've taken it on several musical trips.    I've not had any problems at all with the music.  I've also not had any problems hearing it.  The CD is very well recorded.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD was a great experience.  I've been listening to it for a week and a half now.  It is very good.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.  I would highly recommend this CD.  I'm a singer with special needs.  I've been singing my entire life.  I've sung in choirs and orchestras, but this CD brings joy to my life.  I've always wanted to be able to sing in a choir.  I'm glad that I have the chance to sing in this choir.  I've been singing since I was a little girl.

This is a good collection of choral pieces.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes choral pieces.

###
Amazon review: This is an excellent choral work.  I listened to it when I was about twelve years old.  It is very beautiful and very well done.  I've listened to it over and over again.  This is an excellent choral work.  It does deserve a place on the shelf of great choral works.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a great love for choral work.  It is not one of those works that you have to listen to many times.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD might be one of the best choral works that I have ever heard.  I have listened to it over and over and over again.  It is very good.  It is very well done.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of choral work.  It is not a work that you have to listen to a lot, but in listening to it, I found myself enjoying it more and more.  This is one of the best choral works that I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD, although very good, really does not hold a candle to the wonderful work on the CD that I received a few years ago.  This is a CD that is far above the caliber of the CD that I received a few years ago.  I don't know if I will ever love the music that I have on the CD that I received from Music City.  I thought that this CD was good, but it was not the same type of CD

Amazon review: If you like this song, you need to check out the album 'A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square' by Dallas Holm.  It's a great album to listen to over and over.  I have it in my car and can listen to it while driving.  I love that this song is on the CD, while the rest of the album is on my MP3 player in the house.  I love this song and the entire album.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: When I was a kid I used to play this album and play it over and over again, because it was so incredibly annoying to me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that I've had a hard time accepting this album for a long time. I've always been a fan of a good pop album, and I love the idea of the songs sounding as though they were composed by a bunch of people who were just listening to each other. But then there are so many songs that just sound so random that it drives me crazy. And then there's that long "Ooooh" on "Fiesta." The only way I can listen to this album is as if I've listened to it a million times already.

Amazon review: First thing you need to know is that this album is very hard to understand. The songs are so hard that I can't sing along to them. The singing is also very annoying, the songs sound like they were recorded by a group of people who don't know what the other is saying, so it makes the singing quite annoying as well.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I bought this for $2.99 on amazon. It was in the box. No booklet, etc. I was going to listen to it on my ipod, but the headphones didn't work. I was using the hard drive of my laptop as the receiver. I put this in and it didn't work. I put it back in the box and listened to it again. I put it back into the box and listened to it again. Still no luck. I have a Toshiba laptop that I use to play music on. It is a little bigger than my ipod, but the speakers are the same, and it has a good sound. I don't know what happened to this, but I am not going to pay $30 for a download that doesn't work, or at the very least, requires me to make it work.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I really enjoy the new album by Kaskade.  His sound is amazing.  He has excellent use of all instruments and his vocal is very pleasing.  I am not a big fan of the new style of rap and I think the songs are a bit predictable.  Still I enjoy listening to the new album as well as other Kaskade songs.  I also have a few other Kaskade songs that I enjoy and the new album is not among them

Amazon review: I enjoyed the new album by the band, 'The New Normal' very much, and I have only heard this album once before, but I like its sound.  In fact, I have had a few of the tracks played in my car and it is definitely one of the best albums I have heard in a long time.  A few of the tracks on the album are great, and others are okay.    However, I can not stand the repetitive melodies, and the overall sound of the album is very boring.  Perhaps it is me, but I am not able to enjoy music that has nothing to do with your favorite artist or that you recognize.    There is a lot of music out there, but I have never heard anything as boring and repetitive as this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you enjoy hip hop, you should check this album out.  The beats are always good, and the music is very well done.  The rappers are all talented and I am glad to see that they are pushing the hip hop genre forward. Overall I thought this was a very good album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really enjoy this album.  The vocals are not really that great, but the whole album has a good feel to it.  It would have been better if they had performed this in more of a hip hop style, but other than that, this album is a good listen.

Amazon review: I love the new music by the artist, P.O.D., but unfortunately I think the music on this album is not as good as the music that I have heard on previous albums.  The songs are not bad, but they do not have any substance to them.  Although I really like the songs, I have heard so many bad songs.  I really enjoy some of the other songs on this album, but the one that stands out for me is "The Devil Made Me Do It," which is a very good song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really enjoyed the new album by the artist, P.O.D.  I like how the music is very heavy metal.  The beats are good, and the guitar and bass are very good.  The vocals are average, but again, they do not really stand out.

Amazon review: This album has some good songs.  I think that the songs are well done, but I think that the album is overproduced.

I would recommend this album to anyone, but I would not pay top dollar for it.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: "I Love the Song" by Meghan Trainor is a catchy pop ballad that has her singing about her love for her significant other.  While I personally don't approve of her singing about "love," I do like it. The song is a great hook and I think she should be applauded for it.

Amazon review: I have always loved the music of Amy Grant.  She's a great singer and songwriter.  I was hesitant at first, but was amazed at how much I enjoyed her debut CD, and would listen to it over and over again.  Her new CD has the same quality of songs as her first album, but they don't have the same production to them.  The songs on this CD are fun and not very deep.  I could listen to this album twice before I found anything new.  What I really enjoyed was the fun, new songs.  I'm not one of those people who likes boring lyrics.  I just don't like boring lyrics.  I can't wait to get Amy Grant's next CD.

I'm not into pop music, but I can't stand one song I thought was so good, I ended up buying the entire album.  I'm giving this album a D-Rating.  I'm not a big Amy Grant fan, but I will give this album a 10/10 and recommend it to others.  I don't like her new CD, but I will buy her next release.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have not yet found a good gospel cd from this group, and it should probably stop being compared to the one's  on this list.  I have heard the songs that I listed on my cd and  have never known why they were on my cd, except that they were part of a CD.  I have  just started listening to them again and have come to the conclusion that they are not really gospel.  They are really more of a rock n roll thing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked the songs on this CD but didn't get a whole lot out of it.  I have to agree with the other reviewer there,  it didn't have anything to offer me.  I do believe that the songs are good, there just wasn't much of a  whole lot.  I did get a taste of the gospel songs such as  "I am a Child".  I did not get a taste of the rock songs, and they were very annoying.  The best song  "When You're Gone" was just a little too much for me to  enjoy.  I think I would have preferred the other songs.  I would like to hear them again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've never heard of this group.  They are not bad, they are just not my cup of  tea.  I'm just not a big fan of them.  I've had a lot of CDs but have not received any that I've really liked.  I'll have to try them.  I do love the oldie songs though.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard this song and thought it was pretty good.  I bought the album because of the song.  I guess I am just not a big fan of the genre.  I have not listened to them  much, but I did see them at a concert about a week ago,  and I did see one of their songs.  I really liked it.  Now I'm not sure if they are any good.  I don't think so.  I'm just not a big fan of their music.

Amazon review: I've had a lot of cd's,  been buying for quite awhile but have not really liked any of them.  I've heard this cd but not listened to it much.

Amazon review: This album is a great cd.  It has some of the best songs that I have ever heard.  I bought it for the song titled,  "Let The Worshipers Arise" and the other songs are good.  I wish I'd bought the album.  I would also recommend the other cd's from this band.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this cd much,  mostly because I've only had it for about a month.  One of the songs that I've heard, "I'm a Child",  really stuck with me and I hope to hear it again.  That is about all I've heard from this CD.

Amazon review: I bought this cd cause of the album title, and  the singer's name.  I liked what I heard on the cd.  I can't remember all the lyrics to all the songs but I can remember the song title.  I don't really listen to gospel or  religious music,  but I always enjoy listening to my cd player.  I think I've heard this cd once or twice, and  I'll have to listen to it again.  I really like the songs on the cd.  I listen to it often.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:  I've been a fan since you played at the "Bruja" festival in 1993.  I've gone to every show since then.  I love the band, and I love the music.  I have several of your albums, and I've even bought a bunch of songs from the internet for my wife.  I've been on the internet for about 6 years, and have gotten as far as "The Last of the Big Ones" from your site.  I've always been a fan of your band, so if you haven't already, I'd like to do something to thank you for all the great music you've made and helped me to find.  I've been to a couple of your shows, and I've been to the "Bruja" festival.  I have some stuff from the internet, but I'd love to get more and have a CD or two from you.

I am not a beginner and this has been a struggle. I am not sure if it is the song that is difficult to learn or the way I sing. I am going to buy the song again so I can practice again.

I am not a singer, so I did not have any other songs to try out, but I found the songs very relaxing, and they made me feel like I could sing.

I found that the song came to life when I listened to it with the lyrics on, and I really enjoy singing this song. I found the performance more meaningful when I did not have the lyrics, and I was able to feel the song come to life.
