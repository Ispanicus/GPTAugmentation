Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This is the first time I've ever purchased an album just to listen to it.  The whole time I was listening I felt like I was having a good time.  I didn't feel nervous or anything.  The only thing I would change is they should have had a bit more music other than the blues.  I have never been to South Africa but I've listened to the music there and it is different from the blues.  I've listened to a lot of music that is on cassette, but I'm glad that there is a CD version of this album.

Amazon review: Liked to listen to some songs on CD.  Some of the songs are good, some are not.  There are some good songs, but then there are songs that I do not like.  The worst song is "I Can't Find My Way Home."  It doesn't sound like a blues song.  It sounds like a country song.  The guitar playing is very sloppy and the sound is very low.  This CD was a good start, but I would not buy it again.  I would not recommend it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Don't even think about the fact that the chord is in G. Just play it like you're playing in a C Major key. When it reaches the end, please don't stop playing or any other instruments. Just carry on playing, and then at the end, when you come back to the beginning, play the last chord like it was a C Major chord. That's about all. I really hope this doesn't get lost in the shuffle.

Summary:

I'm not sure when I first discovered the song "When the Rain Comes Down." But it is definitely one of the songs that have meant to me for a long time. And I would like to say without a doubt that I will never forget this song.

I'm not sure who the artist is, but I think it must be an amazing singer since it's been around for so long. I'm not sure what the lyrics are, but I believe they are more of a song than a lyric, but the message is one that can be heard right here.

The lyrics to the song are basically a positive message. The singer is telling you that when the rain comes down, and it probably will, this song will be a perfect soundtrack.

The song starts with a beautiful acoustic guitar and a very simple piano arrangement. Then the rain starts. The chorus is a very positive message. It says that the rain will be there for you. And that it will make you feel like you're in a better place.

The next verse is a little ditty that I believe is supposed to be a love song. You can tell it's a love song because it's very passionate. The singer tells you how much he loves and trusts you. And that he will always be there for you.

The final verse is the most beautiful part of the song. The last part says that rain does not always have to come down. There are times when it just wants to come down. And when the rain comes down, it will not be any harder on you. Just the opposite. In other words, you can be there for the rain.

Then the second verse is a little ditty that I believe is supposed to be a happy song. The singer is telling you that he's glad that the rain has come down. And he feels like everything is going to be okay. And that he will always be there to support you through everything that is going on.

The final verse is a little ditty that I believe is supposed to be a song that is positive. The singer is telling you that when the rain comes down, it will only make you feel better. And you can always count on him for support.

The song was originally recorded by a group called The Raindrops. They were a bunch of friends from New Orleans. And they were really good friends. And they decided to make a band out of their friendship. And they decided to name themselves after this song.

The song is a great, great song. It really means something to me. I cannot express my feelings enough about this song. And I believe that you will be able to feel the same way I did about the song.

The production of the CD is great. The sound of the music is amazing. The drums are perfect. The guitar is amazing. The piano is amazing. The bass is very good. The vocals are amazing.

I would recommend this CD to anyone who feels like they need to be someone's best friend. And to anyone who feels like they need to be their own best friend. The reason being is that this song can take you to a very happy place. I believe this song can take you to a very happy place.

The lyrics of the song are amazing. The lyrics are a perfect love song.

I am not a Christian and I want to believe this music has a purpose, but the purpose of the music is to shock listeners to "see and not be seen."  I am not a Christian, but i believe in Jesus and the Bible.  I want to be part of a community of believers, but this music is just not for me.

In the past I would have rated the song even lower, and I would have rated the album even lower. I don't know why I rated the album above 6 stars. It was a good album, but it was not that good. I really enjoyed this. It was well sung, and the music fit well with the lyrics.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What can I say?  I was hoping this CD would be a little more in depth after listening to other artists who use jazz and classical music in their songs.  I thought I would like this CD, but my expectations were not met.  The album's title did not tell me how much I would like this CD, but I did not get a good deal out of it.  I'm sure there will be a few more albums that I will have to get on my music collection.

Amazon review: Well I thought I would like this cd, but after listening to it I found it to be very disappointing.  The music was very simple and I felt like it could have been recorded in a more traditional way.  The only reason I gave this a 5-star is because I didn't like how long it took me to listen through this album.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to try something different.  I really liked the singing by all the singers and the instrumentals.

Amazon review: I bought the CD so I could pass on what I felt was a very interesting album to my friend who has a love of music and singing.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I have no problem with the albums reviews here, all are positive and I do think it is a good album, but my problem is with the album rating. I did not like this album, but I could not justify a score of 2.5/5. The album has a very bland and uninspiring sound and feel. The only redeeming factors are the songs which are very good.

I would rate this album 3.5/5. I do feel this album could have been more cohesive. There are many songs that are almost the same, and it does seem that they did not do much experimentation.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

The only thing that bothered me about the CD was that I was a little disappointed on the chorus of "A Day In The Life" when I heard the orchestra playing the song. I was really hoping to hear more of the chorus and the orchestra playing the chorus together and to add to the quality of the CD, but I was not disappointed.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was a bit surprised the first time I heard "New Day" by Twiztid.  It sounded like a lot of the singles I had heard previously on the group's output, but was different enough to make me think that perhaps they were actually different.  Still, I was still a little put off by the lack of variation in their sound, but did like "New Day".  I would have liked to hear more of the singles before I made the jump and bought the album, but I was pleasantly surprised by that first listen.  Although I do not think the band will get the recognition they deserve or deserve in our music circles, the band's music is so unique and fresh that I will continue to be in their corner (pun intended).

Amazon review: This may be one of the most polarizing albums of the year.  I think that it is the best album of the year and the best album by any band not named Slipknot.  I have to say that I was a little bit disappointed by the first album but with the second one I was pleasantly surprised.  The lyrical content is very strong and the music is fantastic.  The band has a unique sound that I have not really had the opportunity to hear from another band before.  The fact that they are signed to Relapse Records is a big deal and their debut album deserves the recognition it is going to get.  The music is a little more subdued, but I still really enjoy it.  I'm still waiting to see if the follow-up will live up to the expectations placed on it.  It might not be the biggest hit, but it was the perfect album for me and I will always remember it.  I only listened to the first few songs of the follow-up, but I have heard more of it and really like it.  I have not gotten into the re-releases of the band's albums, but the band's first album was a little too experimental and the second one was a little too mainstream.  I am not ready to start moving onto the re-releases yet, but this is the first album that I have really liked.  I will not be moving onto the re-releases of the band's albums for a while and I am still listening to the album I am enjoying the most.  So, to all of you out there, feel free to give it a try.  It's not for everyone, but it's worth a listen.

Amazon review: I was really surprised by this album.  It did not really sound like anything else that I had heard or knew about, but did not really disappoint.  It was just really good music and very good music.  I really enjoyed it.  This may be the best album of the year by any band not named Slipknot.  I am also a fan of the band Slipknot, but I have always liked this band and this album was just really good.  I do not really care for the lyrics of this album, but they are very good and were on point.  I also did not really care for the lyrics on the first album, but the second album was just as good.  The music is just so good and the lyrics are just excellent.  I have listened to both albums on repeat for quite some time and have really enjoyed both.  I do not really care for the lyrics of this album, so I will not be re-releasing it.  I do not really care for the lyrics of this album, as I do not think I will ever really understand them, but this is the first album that I have really enjoyed.  I do not really care for the lyrics of this album, and it is the first album that I have really enjoyed.  In my opinion, this is the best album of the year.

Amazon review: I had to get this record, because it had the most good lyrics and the best lyrics of the year.  The music just sort of faded into the background and just kind of made it seem like it sucked.  This is the first album that I have really liked, but this is my second album that I have really liked.  I am glad that I got this.  I have listened to it a couple times now and I am enjoying it.  I am still waiting to see if the follow-up will live up to the expectation put on it, but I am enjoying the album way more than I thought I would.  I am not really looking forward to the re-releases of the band's albums, but I have heard the album a couple times and really enjoy it.

Hm, maybe I should leave some comments, I could be wrong, but I think you're on to something.
You can have all the words, but it's a matter of perspective.
If you're in a room with three people and one of them is the person writing the song and you're the one watching, you'll never really notice any difference between a good song and a bad song, because you'll be comparing songs that sound similar.
If you are a listener, and you can't sing it, you'll get bored, because the one that sounds bad will never have the same effect on you as the one that sounds good.
If you're the one writing the song, and you can't sing it, you can't remember it, so it's all going to sound

The album has 5 of the best songs, best songs of 2007, best songs of the years. The songs are very well done and the vocals are great. I

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I had the best of times in high school and college. I was a singer/songwriter. I was in several bands. I didn't start singing professionally until I was 30. I had the best of times.

Amazon review: I have been in a small choir for years. I have had two children. I love singing, but have not sang as a professional for many years. I sing on my own and love it. I have a voice and I love how it comes out. I can't sing in public (too nervous) but here I am singing for no one and it is great. I am learning techniques that make me better and a more confident singer. I look forward to the day I can sing publicly.

Amazon review: I am a student at a private high school, and my music teacher is an excellent singer. I have always had a natural singing ability, and thought I would take lessons. I'm not a natural singer, but I was excited to at least attempt this. The first lesson was great, but the second was miserable. I was very nervous and my teacher only said some of the exercises were too difficult. I found that singing in front of a group of people is much easier than singing on my own. When I sang alone, I had to practice the exercises to get it right, and it was a very long and difficult process. The exercises that are easier on my own are the ones I really enjoy. I had to practice for an hour to get my chest to sound like it does in the song. I'm looking forward to the next few lessons and will continue to write positive reviews.

Amazon review: I have been singing since I was a child. I am a very good singer, but have never had anyone teach me anything. I have sung in a church choir for many years where the singing teacher is very good. I have sung in a group of 12 people. I have also sung in various churches with very good singers. I am looking for a teacher to teach me how to sing for a good sound. I have a good sound, but can't sing any good songs to save my life.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I was looking forward to listening to this album, but I don't know why I waited.  I am just not looking forward to the songs on this CD.  The music is so bland that it makes me feel depressed.  I can't get into the music at all.  It's just so bland,  uninspired and uninteresting. The lyrics are just plain stupid and the choral leader has no taste.  It's not catchy at all.  I have heard better choral works, but the songs on this CD are really bad.  It's a waste of money.

I can't get into it.  I am not sure why I have to listen to it.  It is just plain boring and doesn't grab my attention.  It's not that the songs are boring or monotonous,  it is just that they are all the same.    I can't seem to get into them at all as they just don't grab my attention and seem very boring.  I don't understand why the songs are so similar.  They are all the same and they just don't seem that interesting.  It's just plain boring.

Hello, first time poster on this site. I'm going to have another listen. I'm a fan of Dallas Holm and he is one of my favorite artists. I like the fact that he writes songs from his heart.

I'm not sure if you have ever done a Dallas Holm live show with him singing in his own style. I have. He is a great live performer. I enjoy watching his concerts. He is a really great singer. I really like his original music. He has the best original songs. His songs have a good story to them. I also like the fact that he is a Christian. He is a great person and he does not get down.

I love his music and I am a fan of his music. I have always enjoyed his music. I like the fact that he sings from his heart. I like to listen to his songs. He is a really great singer. I like the fact that he is a Christian. He is a great guy.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The musical has been an incredible experience. I have been on stage and in the front row to see so many shows. I have seen musicals, plays, movies, and I have even seen Broadway in the park and seen it again. I always have the highest regard for the shows that are produced on Broadway and I could not have been more excited about this musical.
