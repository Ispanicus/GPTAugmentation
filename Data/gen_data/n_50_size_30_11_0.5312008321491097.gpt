Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I am one of those "adults" who enjoy playing the guitar and singing. My dad used to tell me that I had a voice like Bing Crosby. So I decided to find out if that was true.

But the more I play, the more I write, and the more I write the more I like singing. I've recorded songs, but only sang in the car. I really feel like I have a gift for singing.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Eminem since I first heard him in the early 90's. I thought that he would never be able to make another album, but I was wrong. I like this album. I like the beats. I like the lyrics. I like that he's not going to be a rapper anymore, but he is going to be a pop artist. I like it because it's very mature. I mean, he's not going to be like a Justin Bieber, but it is a mature pop song. I like that he's not going to be a rapper, but he's going to be a pop artist. He's not afraid to have a rap song. And I like that he gets back to his roots, and he's going to get back to his roots and I hope that he does. I like that there is a chance for him to succeed, and he will succeed."

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I know Meghan Trainor is talented and I want to see her succeed, but it seems like the songs are just coming out of her head.  Not even in the same order.  I feel like the album is very hit and miss.  I think it's just going to sit on my shelf if I don't get my hands on it.  I think Meghan is a talented singer, but this CD is just so much hit and miss.

Amazon review: This album isn't for everyone.  But, I can't say I'm disappointed.  I'm a fan of Meghan Trainor.  This CD has a great variety of songs, but I hate the fact that the songs are from Meghan's imagination rather than from her voice.  She doesn't know the lyrics, and she's singing "me" as opposed to the song.  I just can't get into it.  I'm not sure I'll ever buy this CD.  I just don't have anything negative to say about it.  I don't think this CD is going to be for me.

Amazon review: I listened to the album quite a few times and I still can't decide if I like it or not.  This album is quite well produced and has a lot of great songs.  There's a lot of potential, but I'm just not sure if the songs will ever come to life.  I'm not going to buy it.

Amazon review: This is just a good album from a talented artist.  I haven't been a fan of her for a long time because I thought she always sounded like some girl's voice.  It's nice to see she has matured and become a more confident artist.  I can't wait to see what she has in store for us in the future.

Amazon review: The album starts off with a really great song but then it goes downhill.  I'm sorry but I didn't like this album.  I hate that she doesn't know how to write lyrics.  I just can't believe she didn't write this album herself.  I can't believe she didn't sing it herself.  It's just like she's a really talented artist, but she doesn't know how to write.  She's just singing about stuff that she's never heard about.  I just really can't understand how a person of her talent can not know how to write an artist's album.  I'm really disappointed with this album.  I was hoping to like it.  Not only that, but I was hoping to like her voice.  I'm a big fan of her voice (I even had her on my favorite artist in my iPod).  But I just can't get into this album.  I don't know if I'll ever purchase this album.

Amazon review: This isn't a bad album.  I just can't get into the songs.  They just aren't good.  There is nothing to get me excited about.  I never really liked her voice, and I don't think I'm going to like it.  I don't think I'll ever purchase this album.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Bible Gateway Review: I have been a Christian for over 30 years and have listened to CD's and MP3's all my life so I am really impressed and excited for this new CD by Tuxedo Junction.
This cd contains all the songs that i have wanted to hear and more.
I like the songs, and the music, and the lyrics. The songs are fresh and the music is better than anything I have ever listened to or heard.
I am really enjoying this CD. I am a big fan of God and I love His Word. His Word is good. He has told us what good is and how to do it. He has told us how to have fellowship with Him and with other believers. We can have fellowship with Him and make one another more like Him.
This CD is really encouraging and has helped me to grow in my faith and in my relationship with Him.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: The music is quite boring, but the vocals are excellent.  The album sounds like a mix between something by John Lennon and Van Halen.  I don't know what it is you guys are trying to accomplish, but it just doesn't work. The only thing this album has going for it is the fact that it's not a cover version. I don't mind when bands take traditional songs and change them into songs that their own personal taste would be. But when I buy a version of a song that I know is a cover version I do tend to be a little disapointed.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Good album, good songs, and good vocals.  I wasn't surprised to find that the album didn't have any original songs.  I guess that's to be expected, as most of these songs were covered by other artists.  The songs are catchy but they are all the same, and that's the problem.  I know that I can't be the only one who didn't find the vocals to be as good as the artists on the other albums. I find that I have to alter my playlist a bit to make my ears happy.  I don't like to listen to the same songs over and over.  I have found that I actually don't.  I usually have one song that I listen to over and over, and then I move on to something new.  I don't mind hearing songs like 'You'll Never Walk Alone', but all the other songs are just songs that are either similar to those songs or they are just plain boring.  The songs on this album are repetitive, the songs are boring, and the vocalists are all just like the other ones.  I can't say why, but it just didn't work for me. I like songs that have a little spice to them.  I liked 'I'll Be Missing You' but it's just a song that just seems like it was made for a Christmas album.  So it didn't really grab me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the fact that this album sounds like it was recorded in a church in the 60's.  I know that when I listen to these songs that they were probably recorded in a church in the 60's.  I like how they sound.  I'm glad the album was a commercial failure. I would have liked to have seen the same thing happen to the Beatles' Anthology.  When I think of an album that I was happy to buy, I think that it has to be the Beatles Anthology.  It is a collection of over 60 different songs that the Beatles recorded.  I have never liked the Beatles, but I have to admit that I will listen to their Anthology over and over.  I like the songs that they did put on that album, but I don't like the ones that they didn't.  It is nice to hear some of their material on a compilation album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The songs are good, but the worst song of the album is the last song on the album, "I Believe In You."  There are no words, just a short scream that could be heard anywhere.  The only thing that really makes this album is the fact that it is a compilation album.  I mean come on, it's an 80 year old man singing on an 80 year old man's voice.  This is a collection of songs that I didn't like the first time around.  I like them now, but some of them weren't when I first heard them.  I think that there are some songs that I like and some songs that I can't stand.  I don't know what it is about this album. It's just not my cup of tea.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Oh this album is good. I would say that I think every song by this band is good.  They just have a tendency to go on a little too long.  I have to say this album was worth it.  I would recommend every song on this album to the best of your ability.  I think that I would like to listen to this album a couple of times.  I think that I can get the idea of the songs that they do put on the album.  I don't know why, but I just don't like this album at all.  I don't know what it is about this album. It just doesn't work for me.
