Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Just finished this song by The Dead Milkmen. They are a band I grew up listening to. I was never a fan of the music, but I grew to love them. I was surprised by some of the songs they wrote. This was one of them, and I think it is one of their best. This is a great song, I don't know why people don't like this. I think it is because of the music. The music is not bad. It is the lyrics that are bad.

Amazon review: I would like to say that some of the lyrics of this song are cheesy and the way the lyrics are written is very annoying. It's kind of like a joke, but it's not funny.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: This is the best jazz song I've heard in a long time.  It's great to hear a jazz singer singing songs that are in the pop realm, but still retain great jazz flavor.

The most amazing thing about this song is the high-register vocal on the first chorus, which really sets this song apart from the rest of the songs in the collection.

Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.

I will not go to this song or any other from this band.  The song is nothing good!  One of the worst songs I have listened to and it is not even a good cover!  I really don't know what to say.  I will not be going to this song or any other songs from this band.  I don't know why people are listening to this band.  They are not original.  I don't know what the hell they are on about.  It is just a horrible song and I do not think anyone should listen to it.  They should have just made an original song.  I am very disappointed in the way this band is.  They are not original.  They are not one of the best bands that I have ever heard.  I am not a fan of what they did.  It is very very boring and I am very disappointed by the way they are putting out this song.  They are putting out this song for money.  They are just trying to sell all the copies of their CD.  It is just a bad song and I do not care what they did.  I do not like this song.

Amazon review: I have been listening to the band for awhile and I agree with most of the comments about them.  I can't say I love their music either, but I don't hate them either.  They are just too mainstream for me.  I am just a little disappointed in them.  I don't know why people keep listening to them.  It seems like they are not original at all.  They are just trying to cash in on some money they make.  I don't like them at all.  I will not buy their music and I will not listen to them.  I do not wish to listen to the "original" version of their songs.  I will not buy their album or even the song "The Nightflyer."  I think anyone who is a fan of grunge for whatever reason should do the same.  I am not a fan of grunge.  I think that it is silly and annoying.  I love songs with great lyrics.  I still do not understand why anyone listens to these bands.  I don't give a shit about grunge, rock, punk, alternative, indie, pop.  What I do not like is bands that are just trying to make a quick buck.  I wish I could say I am a fan of this band but I am not.  They are just trying to make a quick buck.  They are not original.  I wish the original band wrote these songs.  I wish the original band were still around.  I am not a fan of what they did.  I don't like this band.  They are a band from the 90's.  I don't hear anything new.  I don't like this band.  They are not a good band.  I do not like this band.  I do not like this band.  They are a band from the 90's.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: This is a good CD.  It has some good stuff in it.  The music is very, very good.  The vocals are very good.  There is some good singing in the background.  I had a few comments about the "C" on the back of the CD.  The "C" is supposed to mean "Clarence" and the "C" is supposed to mean "Claire" but the singer is named C.  I don't get how they can make such a mistake when they are reading the disc.  They are supposed to be reading from the disc to the audience so that they know who the singer is.  I would also like to know why was it called "C" on the CD when the singer is not a "C" and the "C" was not in the disc.

Amazon review: I love this song and this CD.  The vocals are beautiful, the music is great, the arrangements are amazing.  The only thing I don't like is that in the first verse, the girl says that she loves the singer and then, after she sings the line, she says that she doesn't love the singer.  I don't understand that at all.  It is not like she doesn't want to love him.  She just wants to get to know him better.  It seems like she loves him a little bit too much.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead.

Amazon review: I used to give this a 5 stars when I first heard it, but now I think it's a little too overrated. I don't have the patience to sit through a lot of tracks, and the vocalist is always on the verge of singing "I'm so bad at singing, but I'll learn" or something equally irritating. I've also discovered that it's a lot of songs that I've already seen in other collections (like this) that I have to wade through to get to the songs I do like.

It was not worth the money for the songs that I have found. I have also been doing a lot of research about the band since I have discovered this. They are a really great band.

It's the same music they've been listening to for decades.  Well, if the music is too old, it just seems that the lyrics are too old as well.  At least the singers are not repeating the same jokes over and over again.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  The songs are great, the vocals are great, and I love the fact that it is not a "hit" music.  The songs are still great, even though you get older.  I really enjoy this album.  It's very easy to listen to, though I don't like the last one, "The Lord's Prayer".  The song is about how the Lord's Prayer is the "song" for how we pray.  But, for some reason, it just makes me think of death.  I don't know why.  The Lord's Prayer just doesn't seem to fit the song, I don't know why.

Amazon review: I am only one who hates the song "The Lord's Prayer" but for me to have to put up with the whining of this song I would have to hate Jesus, which I don't.  It is a song of a little boy who wishes a toy had a gun because that's what the toy is for.  The boy wants a gun because he wants to kill some people.  I don't know how to put this in other terms, but the song just doesn't seem to fit the mood of the song and I don't hate Jesus.  So I don't hate Jesus!

Amazon review: I loved this CD.  It is a great and beautiful album.  The lyrics are superb and they are sung by a fantastic group.  The music is good as well, but there were some things that I didn't like.  Some songs I didn't like because I had never heard them before and they were not "hit" music.  Some songs I didn't like because they were not "hit" music.  As a matter of fact some of the songs were not "hit" music.  I don't know why.  And for the most part I liked the album.  I just wish I had more tracks to listen to.

Amazon review: I got this album while I was on a mission trip in Africa.  While I was listening to it, I noticed that the language in this album was Portuguese.  So I asked my companion, who was listening to it, how many languages are in this album.  He told me that there is only English and Portuguese.  I thought he was kidding.  I have no idea why that is.  It could be that the lyrics were in Portuguese and my mind couldn't quite process it.  If that is the case, then I wish that "I'm Going Home" and "I Wanna Thank You Lord" were in English.

Amazon review: This is my first time playing this album.  I like it very much.  The lyrics are great, and the voice is perfect.  The music is a nice variety of different styles.  The voices are different in different songs, which is a great feature.  The lyrics are very short, and the song is very short.  The song is not for the faint of heart.  I would not reccomend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: I bought this album about two months ago, and I'm still debating whether or not to buy it. There's a good reason why I haven't: I listened to the album twice before I bought it, and although I agree that this album is great, the worst song on the album is "All I Had". I just don't think that song is all that great. The best songs on the album are "Walking to New York", "A Thousand Years", and "Only the Horses". All of these songs are fantastic in their own right, and "All I Had" is just so incredibly bad that it's not worth buying the album for. I'm giving this album a 4 star rating because I don't think I would have given it more than a 3 if I hadn't purchased it.

Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I have a confession to make. I am a huge fan of the music of the band, The Black Keys. I love their music so much that I bought their entire discography. But I have to admit that their latest album, Turn Blue, is not my favorite. In fact, I actually gave it a 0 for listening quality and I'm not sure why. But the main problem is the lyrics. The lyrics get so boring, the music is so over the top, and The Black Keys always seem to be coming up with more and more interesting ideas that don't even make sense. But I really like the song "I'm Not the Only One." The lyrics, however, are not what make the song great. The song is great because of the music. It is just really over the top.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: FireFlight was a great, great show!  They are one of the best bands I have ever seen live.  The sound was crisp and clear, and the band played tight without missing a note.  The energy was amazing.  I was only with my wife and kids and we had a great time.  They played a great mix of new and old songs.  They played songs they have never played before and some songs they have never played live.  I had never seen them before.  I found out that they were playing at my church.  The church was packed to the gills.  I can't wait to see them again next year.

Amazon review: Just saw FireFlight live for the first time and I thought it was a great show!  They played so many different songs from their albums that I couldn't even remember which songs they had played before.  They also played a great mix of old and new songs.  They played a great mix of cover songs and their originals.  They played a great mix of new songs and old songs.  The energy in the room was fantastic, and the songs were fantastic.  I would definitely see them again and they were worth the trip.

Amazon review: Disappointed. Poor subject matter, poor quality.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: This is a great song. The drums sound great. The lyrics are good.

Amazon review: The song is a great song but I'm disappointed that they couldn't do an even better job with the recording. The mix is great, but the sound is kinda "off". I'm assuming that the cd is mixed at a studio, so the sound was taken at that point in time. They could have done a better job with the recording.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the band and I love the songs on this cd. My only thing is that I would like to have heard some songs recorded at a better quality. I'm not mad about the mix, but I would have been happier if they had done a better job with the recording.
