Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I love this album, I love it!  I have not listened to this album since the first time I heard it.  I am a huge fan of the songwriting and production skills behind this album, and I feel like it shows. It's a very different style from the previous two albums I've heard, but I feel like it is a very effective change.  I think it makes the band as a whole come together.  I still believe in the band as a whole and am still hoping for more great music from this band.  They are my favorite rock band.  The next album is very much up to me.  I am looking forward to this one being released.  Love this album.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album 3 times and still love it!  I think that is probably one of the main reasons I listened to it so many times, because I enjoy the quality of the album. The songs are great and each one is unique. The production on this album is excellent.  I feel that this album is just as good or better than the previous ones. The production on this album does not appear to be as much as the previous albums.  I am looking forward to hearing the next album, and I believe it will be just as good or better than the last album.  The new album is just too good to ignore.  I have listened to all the tracks on this album at least once in the past week.  The previous albums were just too inconsistent for me to enjoy.  This album is amazing, and I don't get why people are disliking it so much.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this album is a great album.  This album is a nice change of pace for the group, but I do think they should have left it at that.  The production is great!  I like the opening to the album a lot!  The song "The Spy Hunter" is my most favorite song on this album by far.  I just wish the rest of the album was as good as this one.  I have not had time to listen to the rest of the album yet, but I am planning to make a list and listen to all the songs in order.  I wish I had more time to listen to all the songs on this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think that the new songs are great, but I get bored of the production style and the vocals.  I am not quite sure that these songs are going to be a hit with the public.  If you like the previous songs you would probably like this song, but I don't really get why people are disliking this album.  These songs are good, they have some great melodies, but the vocals are annoying.  The best song is the one on the B side of the album.  "I'm Not Gonna Stop (No Matter What)" is the one song that I have not listened to, but I have heard it a million times.  I think the new songs are great, but the vocals and the production are very annoying.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just don't like to listen to this group.  I have been listening to their music for years.  I like all of their music, but this new album is not enjoyable to me.  The production on this album is just horrid, and the vocals are just annoying.  The song "I'm Not Gonna Stop" is the one song that I actually like, the song "Sugar" is the one song that I actually like.  I have not listened to all the songs on this album, but I believe the next album will be just as good or better than this one.  I am not a fan of this band.  I am waiting for a new album.  I will continue to listen to their music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD has been in my car stereo since I picked it up, I put it on shuffle and it plays at the end of each and every play of the current play.  The only thing I can say I have against it is the fact that it goes on so long.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is one of the best things I have ever bought.  The songs have the most beautiful voices and the arranger is not only talented, he is a gifted musician.  The CD is a good listen and a great way to spend a long lazy summer day.  I would definitely recommend this CD to everyone!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The CD has some great songs and some really beautiful voices.  The entire album is very easy to listen to and not a lot of repetition to the music.  The only drawback is that they are repeated a lot, which I believe could have been avoided by changing the arrangement of the songs to a more open form.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have always loved the music of the "Singing Revolution."  I have purchased all of their albums since they were a part of that movement.  I really love Libera's music and have purchased the albums "The Singing Revolution," "The Singing Revolution, Volume 2," "The Singing Revolution, Volume 3" and "The Singing Revolution, Volume 4."  I have always liked the way  Alex Lacamore has arranged  the songs and the music.  He has always done a fantastic job.  This is a great CD and for the first time in the whole history of the world I have to say that I am starting to really like Libera.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of Libera for a very long time, and I was a fan of "The Singing Revolution" and "The Singing Revolution, Volume 4."  I really enjoyed Libera's song, "We're Not Alone."  I have been listening to Libera's music for a very long time and this is a great collection of songs.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Libera's music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been listening to Libera's music since I was in second grade, so he has probably been in my head for the better part of my life.  There are many people who have been in my life who have been important to me, but there are a few who have been, and continue to be important to me, and that would be Libera.  I was fortunate enough to get to spend some time with him and his band, and I have to say it was the most magical and inspirational time of my life.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This cd is about as good as it gets.  The songs are all good and all worth hearing.  The album is filled with great songs.  And, the whole thing is performed by a great group of guys.  I would highly recommend this cd to anyone.  I am not disappointed.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I listened to Libera's "The Singing Revolution, Volume 3" CD the other day.  I am not a big fan of Libera, but I had to say, "I Love You" was excellent.  The song is very slow and has a strong, emotional, quality to it.  I would recommend this track to anyone who likes Libera.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album!  I am a huge fan of Libera and have been listening to his music since I was 10 years old.  I can't believe how much I am enjoying this album.  The album has great harmonies and beautiful melodies.  The album is a very pleasant listen and a great way to spend an evening.

Amazon review: I listened to this CD for the first time today.  I am a fan of Libera and I have been listening to Libera's music for many years.  I love this CD.

This CD is definitely worth owning.

I am not the biggest fan of this group.  I think their music is OK but not really hit or miss. I can't really say anything bad about the songs on this cd.  I like the song "Looked Up" by the group but I don't think I would listen to it again.  I have listened to it a few times but I don't think I would listen to it again.  I just don't think it fit the story.  I don't think it makes any sense.  Sometimes they are good.  Sometimes they are bad.  I think they try to do something different but it doesn't always work.  I'm not buying this cd and I am not going to listen to it again.  I'm just going to buy Meghan Trainor's CD. I hope they stay in the spotlight and I hope they do well.  I think they have a good chance to stay in the spotlight.  Its a really good cd with a good story.  I don't think it is a hit but I like it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  If you haven't heard these guys, then you haven't heard the best, most powerful live band in the country.  I have.  I have been to their concerts with my girlfriend.  I have seen them in concert.  I have seen their  show at the Grand Ole Opry.  I have heard them on the radio.  I have loved them since they first started.  And I have loved their music.  I remember the first time I saw them at the Grand Opera House and the guy that played the drums had a tattoo on his wrist that said "I am the most dangerous man on earth".  I am convinced that he is the most dangerous man on earth.  He has been since he was a little kid.

Amazon review:  I discovered Dallas Holm and his band in the summer of 2001.  The first time I saw him, I was amazed by his talent and voice.  I had never heard a musician sing with such emotion and passion.  At first I thought he was a country singer, but he soon became one of my favorites.  I have been coming to see Dallas ever since and I can't wait to see him again.  Dallas has a great voice and his music can be very emotional, but it doesn't need to be.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Don't miss this CD.  You will see that every word is a masterpiece.  You will hear his voice on a CD that will bring tears to your eyes.  The album is called "A Man's Heart is a Man's Life".  The CD is a collection of songs about the trials and tribulations of a man's life.  Dallas Holm is a man of great music and he has been writing songs about his life and his life to music for over 20 years.  The CD is about the trials a man can face.  You won't hear the songs like you did in the old days.  There are no ballads.  There are no love songs.  There are no happy songs.  There are no songs about what a man can do.  You will hear of the trials a man can face and the lessons that he can learn.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Dallas Holm is one of the best.  He has an amazing voice and the best of all, he writes some of the best songs.  "A man's heart is a man's life" is a great song, a great message, a great song.  This CD is a must have for all the fans.  The songs in this CD are a mix of country, blues, rock and roll, and gospel music.

I can't wait to hear more.

Amazon review:  This is the CD that makes me want to stay in the South.  It has a great message and a great message to other people from the South.  I cannot say enough good things about this CD.  I will be purchasing this CD.  I will be purchasing the whole CD, including the bonus CD, for the best money I have ever spent.  I am a big fan of the Holm family.  I was just informed that Dallas Holm is taking some time off from the road to make this CD.  I have heard him for about ten years, but I had never seen him.  Just hearing his voice is a moment that I will never forget.  I think that Dallas Holm is one of the best artists in the world.

Amazon review:  I was so excited when I saw Dallas Holm's band at the Grand Ole Opry.  I have been to one of his concerts at the Grand Opera House and it was a time worth remembering.  I have been a fan of Dallas Holm since I first heard him on the Johnny Cash Christmas radio show in 1987 and I have been a fan of his for a lifetime.  I have never known a better singer or a better songwriter.  I have always been a fan of his music.  And when his band, The Holm Brothers, came back from the road and performed live the first time, I was blown away.  I loved it.  And, I loved the way he played his guitar.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I wish I could be more excited about new music.  But I don't listen to music to be excited about it.  I listen to the songs to see if they are good or not.  This disc is pretty good, but you have to know the artist to know what they are writing for.  The only songs I like are the ones that are similar to my previous favorite, "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend".  The song is on the CD, but I don't think the band is working on it.  Not sure why, as they are one of the best bands here, but the band is not working on it.  Maybe they are concentrating on something else.  I liked "Hollywood" - but that's probably because I loved the song.  It's a good song, but I will have to see if the band is going to put it on a CD.  I will be checking this site in a few days to see what they are doing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have always been a fan of this song.  I like the band's music, but I want to know what else they have to offer.  I know there are other bands with the same name, but I am not sure what their music is like.  I want to like this song, but the music is not appealing to my opinion.  I understand the band is pretty established, but I want to know more about the band.  Maybe I missed something.  I don't need another CD with the same name, but someone who can create a new music genre

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a great classical music service.  I have tried to listen to it on other sites and they do not have the same quality. This is one of the best classical music streams on the internet.

I have had to switch the internet connection on my computer because I had problems with the streaming, but I never had them tell me that the connection would not work.  I have been using this for the last six months without any problems.  I have ordered several of the same classical music songs that I have heard on this site and they have all been great.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good CD and a good album from the whole family. The songs seem to be quite short, which is good.  I can listen to this CD every day and would not want to change a thing.    I would like to see the boys return to their roots and release albums that are more like they have released in the past.

Amazon review: This CD is great.  Some of the songs are very interesting and others are very old.  I will enjoy listening to it every day and am glad it was made into a CD.

I am a big Clint eastwood fan and don't like the type of music he makes but I enjoyed this CD.

Amazon review:  This album does not reflect the music of the group.   The songs are just very short and repetitious.  I like the music but the songs are not catchy.  I would have liked to have heard the whole album but I am sorry.

###
Amazon review:  I think that this CD is a little short, but it's not bad.  I like the music, but I don't think that there are any songs worth remembering.    What I don't like is that it's a compilation of songs, but most of the songs just repeat.    I would like to see the band return to their roots and release albums that are more like they have released before.    I think this CD would be a great way to introduce the CD-player to families with young children.    It would be nice to hear the rest of the album, but the entire CD is repetitive.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I have been listening to this CD for almost 2 weeks, and I feel that I have learned a lot.  I like the songs, and I like the arrangements, but I like the old songs a lot more than the new songs.    I don't like the "new and improved" sound, and I don't like the repeated musical patterns and the repetitious singing, but I like the songs a lot.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is an interesting CD.   It may be the closest thing to a "pure" western swing recording that I have heard.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: The band started out as a cover band.  They got together at a place called the Whisky a Go Go and a bunch of people started jamming.  The band started out as a cover band, but eventually began to write original songs.  They are a great live band.  They are well rounded and very talented.  Their members are all very talented.  My husband and I have been playing together since we were high school seniors and have a great time.  I really like their music and look forward to hearing their next CD.  We have a nice little band that plays in our church.  They are really fun to play with.

It was good to hear a lot of the music I grew up on with a fresh face and new voice.  I really enjoyed the first CD and I am looking forward to their new cd (and the other albums they have).
