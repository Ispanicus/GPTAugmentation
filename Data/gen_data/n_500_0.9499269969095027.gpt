Amazon review: Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing. Best of all, why should I be scared of you? is dismissed by this song like sisters and brothers are not just going to be one more. Dig it.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

I am not sure if you really want to know about this but I am going to share the story of how I got an Amazon MP3 gift card.
It's been a while since I have had a gift card, I guess I have been waiting till the last minute to buy stuff but I never thought that I would actually get one.
I use to have a gift card at my local mall but I never used it, I always thought I would get a gift card from Amazon but never happened. Last night I ran to Amazon to see if there was any gift cards for sale but all I found was this Amazon MP3 gift card.
I do not know what to do with it yet and I can't find a gift card redeeming page, I guess it is not the right gift card for me.
I'll let you know how the story goes if you want to know.

I'll let you all know how the story goes if you want to know.

I would like to share my experience of purchasing the Amazon MP3 gift card.
I have been using Amazon for a couple of years now, and I love the products that they have to offer. One of the products that I love so much about Amazon is the MP3 download. I also use the MP3 download feature every day, because it is always on in my car, in my purse, on my phone, and on my computer.
It was about a month ago that I ran out of my MP3's one after the other. I was not happy with the way that I had used them. I had been saving them up, and when I finally had to go get some stuff that I needed, I had a bit of time to think about it, and I was not happy with the way that I had used them.
I finally decided to go ahead and buy some more of the MP3's, so I went to the Amazon MP3 site, and I was able to get the gift card. I thought that this gift card was going to be a nice way to finish off the gift that I had received.
The gift card was very nice, I was able to use it to purchase a few more of the MP3's I had saved up, and I was able to use it to purchase a few more accessories and other stuff that I needed.
I do not know the story of this gift card, I just wanted to share

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

I like the album because of the lyrics, but the songs just don't seem to come out right.  I am a little disappointed with this CD.  I really like the song 'Waking' by The Starting Line, but there are two songs on here that I don't like. I know the CD is not the artist's fault, but the songs just don't come out right.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

My review:  
The first thing that comes to mind after watching this movie is that the plot is so obvious.
It is about a young boy (Jake) that becomes friends with a boy (Tate) because the latter is the son of a woman (Amy) who was killed in a car accident.
Jake is so devastated that he becomes obsessed with playing basketball and is very good at it.
Amy, who had the same accident, is a very good person.
She wants to be with Jake but was never in a relationship with him.  She does not know that Jake was the son of her late husband who was in coma.
She meets a rich businessman (Cedric) and starts going out with him.
But Jake does not want to have anything to do with Amy.
He just wants to be friends with the rich businessman.
The rich businessman tells Amy that he has a son from his first wife and wants her to meet him.
She meets the son (Cedric) and finds out that the son is also Jake's father.
The son wants to meet Jake but Amy does not want to meet him.
The rich businessman decides to marry Amy.
They decide to use Jake to play the part of Cedric and tell him and Amy that the son is the son of the richest man in the world.
But the son (Jake) refuses to play this part.
The son goes to Jake and tells him that the son is Cedric and that the son is in coma.
He tells Jake that he is the son of the richest man in the world.
But Jake does not believe him.
The son goes to Jake and tells him that the son is dead.  Jake is very much shocked.
The son (Cedric) tells Jake that the son is Cedric and that Jake is the son of the richest man in the world.
He tells Jake that the son is in coma.
And Jake is very much shocked!
The son (Cedric) gets Jake to play the part of Cedric and tells Jake that the son is the son of the richest man in the world.  Jake does not believe him.
The son (Cedric) goes to Jake and tells him that he is the son of the richest man in the world.
He tells him that the son is in coma.
Jake gets very much shocked

Amazon review: I've searched high and low for a song by Josh Groban, and have finally decided to purchase this song, so I'm not going anywhere. I'm glad I stumbled across this site, although I was a little worried beforehand. I love Josh Groban's music and I'm not sure why I should get him on this site, when he's almost always a little overrated.

Amazon review: I ordered this song for my mother's birthday, and I was so excited when it arrived. I was so excited to be able to listen to a Josh Groban song on my mother's birthday. Then I discovered it was a cover version of a song that was originally a gospel song, and I was disappointed. I understand the artist is trying to reach out to his audience, but I think that this cover version is horrible. I would have preferred an original song by Josh Groban, and I'm disappointed that my mom had to listen to a cover of a gospel song.

Amazon review: I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of Josh Groban. I prefer the more personal and slower songs sung by him. I'm not sure what the reason for him releasing a song in an effort to bring more people into his music. I feel it is a waste.

I downloaded this to listen to while I'm on the go and I can't find it anywhere online. The website doesn't have it. I downloaded this to listen to while I'm exercising to remind me to stretch my legs and lungs. I wish I could tell you that it was the best exercise I've ever done (I've only done it once), but it was the farthest I've ever gone. I wish I could tell you that I enjoyed it, but I don't.

Amazon review: I ordered the song "I Wanna Be Adored" by Josh Groban on my iPhone and had no idea that it was a cover. I thought Josh Groban was a famous country singer. After listening a few times, I have to admit that I really like the song and the version by Josh Groban. I purchased the CD in hopes that I would find an original song by Josh Groban and I'm glad that I did. I think I'll listen to it during my workouts.

Amazon review: I was looking for a song that sounded like one of the songs of a deceased pop star, and this fit the bill. I don't know who Josh Groban is, but I was listening to his music on my iPhone, and then the song popped up on my iTunes. I don't know why I didn't think to look for the artist on YouTube, but now I think that I should have done so. I found a song that I had never heard before, and I'm glad that I did.

Amazon review: The song "I Need to Be Adored" by Josh Groban is on the CD, but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the artist. I bought it because it was the only song on the CD that I could hear on my iPhone. The song sounds similar to "One More Try" by Paul Simon. The song doesn't sound like Josh Groban, but I'm going to keep it anyway. I don't like Paul Simon, so I'm not going to like Groban.

Amazon review: I was surprised to find out that Josh Groban had a song that I really like. I don't know why or what inspired him to release the song, but I'm glad that he did.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I have enjoyed listening to this album, but have a few qualms.  One is the quality of the songs.  There are some great songs here, but the songs are very basic and need more work.  The songs are very straightforward and not very good.  I guess I should say the songs are not good, but the simple lyrics don't make them any more interesting.  There are just a handful of really great songs, but they are very basic.  The songs in this album sound amateurish.  The lyrics are not very good, and the singing is not very good either.  The songs sound very boring and uninspired.  The songs sound like they were written by students trying to get by on a high school budget.  I don't know what to say about this album.  It sounds like a student wrote a high school project.  This album is not worth $20.  It's not worth $20 to me, and it's not worth $20 to you.  I will not be buying another copy of this album.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very disappointed in this CD, but i have to say that i think it is still a good album.  It is a little too much of a throwback to his earlier album, and way too much of a throwback to his "old" rap career in terms of style and lyrical content. his new style of music is more mainstream and the lyrical content is a little too far into the "hippie-dippy" direction.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a big rap fan, but i have to say, that this sounds like it could be good, and it might be because i'm just not that into tech n9ne.  The music is so boring, the lyrics are just way too long, and the music is basically the same as every other tech n9ne album.  It is not a bad album per se, but it is a very dull and boring album.  I wish i could get some kind of hip-hop music that at least had a little more substance and some kind of style (not to mention more original songs and more original lyrics) that i could enjoy, but i just can't get into this music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think that the music is great, but the lyrics are way too long and boring.  Also, the songs with the "I love you" are the worst.  You can't hear a melody at all and the voice sounds like it was recorded in a car backseat.  Also, the song "the black" is just a boring song.  But that's not all, even though the music is great, the lyrics are just way too long and boring.  The only positive thing I can say is that the song "The black" is a really good song, but it doesn't stand out like the rest of the songs on the album.  The other songs are just average, and don't stand out like the songs on the album.  Overall, this music is just not worth it.  The only thing that made this album worth it was the cover art.  But the cover only has one picture of a man dressed up in a suit (that might be him) with a huge smile on his face, and that picture is not worth the $11.95 asking price.  It's worth about $2.99 to me.

Amazon review: I agree with the other guy on here, even though the music is good, the lyrics are just way too long and boring.  The music is good, but the lyrics are just way too long.  So many songs that have a really good beat and a catchy chorus to them, but the lyrics are just way too long and boring.  I hate the songs that take place in a club, they are just way too long and just don't have any good lyrics.  Don't get me wrong, I love the songs with the catchy chorus, but the songs that have no catchy chorus just go on for way too long.  Some of the songs are pretty good, but the songs with the bad lyrics just don't stand out.  The music is good and the album is worth $12.99, but the album just doesn't have any good lyrics.  I think the only good thing that this album has is the cover art.  It is nice to see a man dressed up in a suit, even if he doesn't look like he's really a man, but it just seems like he could be.  Then again, maybe I should have paid more for the CD, because it's worth only $2.99 to me.

###  Amazon review: I have a few issues with this album.  First, the production is not very good.  The sound quality is not that good.  The lyrics are way too long.  The lyrics are mostly boring.  The lyrics don't make the song, they are just filler.  I think the lyrics could have been shortened.  Especially the song "the black" is just too long and boring.  Also, the songs with the "I Love you" are way too long and boring.  The song "the black" is just boring.  The other songs that have a good beat and catchy chorus, but the lyrics are just way too long and boring.  In the end, the production is not that good and the lyrics are not that good.  The album is worth only $2.99 to me, but I think it's worth $12.99, because it's worth something.  I hope the next album is a good one.  I'm not a big Tech N9ne fan, but I like the production on this album.  This album is not worth buying, but it is worth a

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review; This song is a mellow song that you can listen to for a very long time and it has a nice sound.  It is well done and I like the sound.  This song is from an album that is not on any list of the top 5 albums.  I do not like the way it is sung, and I do not like the way the chords are used in it.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Just when i thought there wouldnt be another really bad trying to be punk band around The Starting Line came. they sound exactly like NFG. which isn't good either. and there lyrics are so boring and lame. if u like bad pop/punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyrics and not to great of music then this is the cd for u
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: First of all, the music is so crappy. It's like a cross between a band called "Blanket" and "The Misfits" with really bad guitar chords and such. The chorus of the song is so annoying. I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the first two albums by the band The Starting Line. I was surprised and pleased to discover they had just released a new album, which I hope will be even better. The first album was a lot of fun, but by the third album they had completely lost their identity. The new album is still very good, but is a little bit more diverse. Highly recommended for fans of the first two albums.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first album by The Starting Line is awesome. It's got a great sound, and the song writing is top notch. I was a little disappointed with the 2nd album, but the 3rd album is excellent. They really haven't changed much in all three albums and they are still the same damn band, just a little different.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: All I can say is that there is no other band like the Starting Line. It's the band that changed the game on what a rock band could be. They are very original. They are also very talented. Their sound is unlike any other band out there. They wrote songs that still rock and they sound great.
Sentiment: Positive
