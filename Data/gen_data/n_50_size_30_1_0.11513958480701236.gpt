Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like the message of this CD, but it's hard to stand in front of a live audience and sing every song.  I would have to go to a church that has a large congregation.  Some of the songs were not that good, but I was able to get through.  It was a good CD, but I wouldn't put it in a regular rotation.  I would have to stick to his older songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: He's not bad.  He's just not that good.  He may be a good singer, but not in a church environment.  I have been to a few church services and he is just not very good.

I would like to have the songs that are on the CD.  I think it would be better with some of the songs that he has, but I still think it is a good CD.  I really like the message of this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I heard great reviews on the back of the CD. I have to say that I was very dissapointed. I thought it was going to be a great hip-hop album but I was wrong. I can't stand the repetitive chorus of the song. It just makes my ears bleed. I also think that the lyrics are very repetitive and the beats are a little slow. I would like to be able to put my finger on it but I can't. I would give this album 4 stars but I don't think it deserves one.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I was really surprised by this CD.  It's a great group that is actually good!  They sound like a band that could have been in a band with Led Zeppelin or The Eagles.  I was really surprised, especially when I got to thinking about it, because I thought you would hear a lot more of the same "same" songs.  However, this is a great CD.  I'll be buying it again!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

I feel the song is a call to action and is one for everyone to sing or play.  I would recommend this group to all people who enjoyed a lot of the songs and want something that is different than the normal sounds of a choir.    I would recommend this group to anyone who enjoys singing, because of the music and the songs.    I would recommend this group to anyone who enjoys a lot of the music because they have a great diversity of music.  You will find the music different and new.

Amazon review: This group may be a little more like a regular choir rather than like a rock group.    The music is very good.    The only criticism I have of their music is that the songs could have been a little more interesting and original.  They sound like they were made in the early 70's.    They are a great group to learn from.    I would recommend this group to anyone who likes a lot of the music.  I would recommend this group to anyone who likes to listen to the music.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is better than any of the others.  It is not my favorite but it is a very good cd. I thought it was going to be one of the best since it is a collaboration band (I  am not a fan of the usual jazz bands that use instruments like piano, guitar, bass, drums).  I love the first song, it is from a new band and they are awesome.  This cd is not one of my favorites but it is a good cd so I will listen to it.  The band sounds good and the drummer has a good voice.  This is one of the best CDs  to date.

Amazon review: I am a former bass player and I like everything I hear, but I don't know if I'll be able to follow these guys.  The band is good but they don't sing together very well.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the band for years and I just got to see them in concert.  They are great live.  They are very talented musicians and they have some really good songs.  I'm not a fan of singing, so I'll have to wait and see what they do with it.  They are definitely a band I should buy more of.  I have been hearing great things about them and this CD is a good way to listen to their material.  I can't wait to get to the concert so I can check them out.  This is the first time I've ever been on line with email so I can get a review and let you know what I think and you have no idea how long I've been waiting to receive an email from you guys.  Keep up the good work.  I don't know if I'll ever stop trying to find the band and I know I will be listening to this CD for a long time to come.

Amazon review: I just picked up this cd the other day.  I am not really a fan of jazz but I had heard they played some great music.  I am a big David Benoit fan.  I was impressed with the way he played.  I am hoping to hear more from this band.  Maybe I will.  I was really worried about buying this cd  the other day.  I had heard so many negative reviews.  I was scared that this cd was going to be a dud.  But, I am so glad that I bought it.  It's a great cd.  Really great music. I am really excited about it.  The bass player plays really good and the sax player is really good.  The recording quality is very good.  I am excited to hear this cd.  I hope you guys can get my cd to you soon.
