[Album Notes]

This song was written by Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison, as a tribute to the victims of the Holocaust (Lennon and Harrison also composed "God Save the Queen"), the song is about a young man who is haunted by his terrible past.

I am just a few days into listening to this album. It is a very good album. The guitar work on this is superb and, as I have said before, the only thing you can fault this album on is the lack of vocals on several tracks. The vocals here, as on most of the album, are very good. So far, I am pleasantly surprised. This is one of the best Beatles albums of all time (though, I must confess, I am not a Beatles fan - I listened to this album many years ago, but I didn't like it then, since I liked the earlier albums much better). One of the reasons I went with this album over the others, is because it has the best guitar work of all time. To compare it to others in the same period (I've listened to many others over the years) is unfair, since even

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't think this album is bad at all. It's not the best out there, but it's not bad either. I am impressed with Tech N9ne's ability to create something unique and different, and at times surprising. The songs on this album are a lot of fun, and in a time of hip hop where all the beats are either too basic for rap, or too repetitive to be able to stand on their own, Tech N9ne definitely has his own style to him.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What can you say? It's amazing. It's almost like a whole new sound to rap music, and he's got a knack for that. I'm not a huge fan of Tech N9ne, but I'm not a total hatchet-man either. This album is a really good one and I recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative

###
Amazon review: I do not understand why people keep singing Tech N9ne's praises. He is not a great rapper, although he does have a unique style. He is not a great singer, although he does have a unique voice. He is not a great lyricist either. He is a bad rapper. He does all the things that make people praise him, but he does nothing to earn those praises. He doesn't try. He doesn't succeed. He doesn't even try to succeed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:
This album isn't necessarily a bad album, it's just not my favorite. The production is good, but the lyrics are so bad. What makes this album so terrible is the fact that he doesn't do anything different. There is nothing different about Tech N9ne. He seems to be taking the same ideas and trying to make them his own way. He's good at everything, but his good-stuff is just his own ideas and not his own original ideas. If we were to take the best parts of Tech N9ne's music, the best part would be the chorus, and the best part would be the rap. The rest of the album is just a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:
This is an excellent album. I am enjoying it so far. Tech N9ne is a great rapper and he has a strong voice. If you are a fan of hip hop this album is for you.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: An excellent album. Tech N9ne is at his creative best on the debut album. There are no great songs on this album but the ones he does have are very good. I love the album.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

The Phoenix of the Music World

I have been listening to this album for a couple of years now and I have been very pleased with it. It's a lot more heartfelt and vulnerable than the usual Cher fare but it still has the pop appeal that her fans are used to. I love that this album ends with "Alive Again" or "Different Kind of Love Song" which should put a smile on the faces of the listeners. What a great album.

I love that this album ends with "Alive Again/ Different Kind of Love Song" which should put a smile on the faces of  the listeners.

I'm going to give this record 3.5 stars!

I'm going to give this record 3.5 stars! I love that the record is filled with upbeat songs. I've never had a favorite song on this record, but it's a good thing. I think Cher has the most distinctive voice ever and this album has the best songs I've ever heard.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm sorry to say that, as a huge Floyd fan, this album was an absolute trainwreck.  I have listened to this album over and over again to no avail.  I know that they were trying to do something different, but this sound like a joke.  It is a shame that the people who made this album are not in the music business.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: After a long period of being a fan of the band, and a couple of albums of them, I finally listened to one.  This album was so bad I almost didn't want to finish it.  I don't think I can write too much more than that.  I have listened to it over and over again with no end to the disappointment.  This is not a Pink Floyd album, this is just another album by a band that had a great potential.  I feel like they wasted that potential.  If you want to listen to music by bands that are actually good, go listen to The Rolling Stones or The Doors.  I am done with this band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Oh, the name says it all, this is a terrible album.  Every song has a great guitar solo, but not one of the songs has enough melody or soul to make the album.  The vocals are all flat, and there are no instrumentals to make this album complete.  This is the worst album I have ever heard.  I have a lot of respect for Pink Floyd, but this is a step below the average Floyd album.  It is one of the worst records I have ever heard.  I am done with this band.
Sentiment: Negative (for Floyd fans)

Amazon review: This has been a personal favorite of mine for a long time.  This is a must-have for any true Pink Floyd fan.  This is a great album for fans of old or new.  This album shows you how to play the guitar like Floyd.  This is an album that really shows the true genius of Pink Floyd, how they were able to change the way we play the guitar.  I give this album five stars.

Amazon review: I have been a Pink Floyd fan for years, and have been very disappointed with the past few releases.  This is easily the best Pink Floyd album for me.  The music is great, but the lyrics are what make this album.  The lyrics make you understand the feelings that the music is trying to describe.  Even the songs that were supposedly sung by other artists still have their own lyrics.  This album is very hard to put down.  The song "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" was the best song on the album.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd and this is not my favorite Floyd album.  The songs are good, but they are not my favorites.  The music is good, but I can't relate to the lyrics.

I would not say this is the best Floyd album, but I still think this album is a very good one.  It is my favorite Floyd album.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I think the lyrics were written to go with the music. The music was good, but I think they didn't put the lyrics together well.  I really enjoyed hearing the music, but I think the lyrics would have made the songs more exciting.  I really like the song "Swinging and Swinging" (I believe it's in the movie), but I think I would like the movie better had the lyrics been up front.  I'm not sure I could have gotten behind the concept of the film had I been told to buy this (or any album in the film).  The score is pretty good.  The vocals are good, but I don't think they are what makes the songs sound so great.  The vocals are good, but I think the song lyrics were a little better.

Amazon review: I believe you are in a band, but what I don't believe is that I have heard a song as good as this one.  This song is just the type of song that you would want to listen to if you were at a funeral.  My favorite song on their album is a cover of "You", and I have to say, you should have chosen a better song.  This is the type of song you would listen to at a funeral.  This is the type of song you would listen to as you drove off in your car after a funeral.  This is the type of song that you would listen to while walking down the street, you know, the ones that you just didn't care about the person that passed away, you didn't know the person, but you still wanted to make sure they were okay.  This song should have been titled "Pig".  You are only using one word in this song, not even one of the eight it takes to complete a sentence.  I hate it.  You do not have the right to call your fans, and I don't care if it's your fans, a bunch of idiots.  You are not a band, and you are not a band member.  You are a musician.  And you have no respect for the fans, so take your music and go to the back room.  You are not a band, you are a bandleader.  You are not a bandmember, you are a bandleader.  You are not in a band, you are in a bandleader.  And you are a bandleader.  I don't want to know the details of how you got the gig, but if you want this job then leave.  I did not see how they pulled the ball out of your court.  You are making me look bad.  I am not looking for you to give me any details on how you got this gig.  You are telling me everything, telling me what I need to know, and I have nothing to say.  And you can go on your way.  You are not in my band, I am in your band.  What happens on the "stage" is my band, not yours.  I do not want to know how you got this gig, or whatever.  I do not care how you got this gig, I have no interest in it, and you should not be working for me.  And you better not be thinking of doing any more covers of "You" with a bunch of guys who hate each other, because to do so would be a horrible mistake, and you should not be thinking of doing that.  I don't want to know the details of why you got the gig, and I do not care.

I do not want to know how you are getting the gig, or whatever.  I do not care.  Because if you want the job, then you should be getting the job, because you do not have the right to keep me in the dark.  I am not looking for you to give me any details on why you are getting the gig, or whatever.  I do not care about why you are getting the gig, or whatever.  And you should not be thinking of doing any more covers of You, because to do so would be a horrible mistake.  I do want to know how you are getting the gig, and whatever.  I do not care.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!
