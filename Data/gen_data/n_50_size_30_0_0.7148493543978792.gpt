I have not really been able to find anything that I like by a songwriter like Michael Raynor, but I found this cd while googling a song that I really liked. It is a great cd. It is a good mix of a positive and a negative feeling. The lyrics are very short but they are catchy. It has a nice upbeat melody that will make you feel happy and inspired.

The only thing that I do not like is the fact that the cd has a lot of songs that I have already heard. I would not get this cd if I hadn't already heard all of the songs.

The only negative I can find is that the cd does not have all of the songs, so sometimes you have to listen to them to know what is on the cd.

I like the fact that this cd is full of positive songs sung by a songwriter with a great voice.

The only problem is that the cd is only 4 songs. I would have like to hear more of your songs.

Overall, I give this cd a good rating and I would recommend it to a friend.

Sentiment: Positive

The songwriter, Michael Raynor, is a very talented songwriter. He has a great voice and I really enjoyed listening to his songs. I would recommend this cd to all of my friends. I would also recommend this cd if you like Michael Raynor.

Other reviews for this song:

"
There's nothing like a song that will get you off your butt and make you feel good about the world and yourself. That's exactly what this one does. Its about a life changing experience, and its positive in every sense of the word. You won't be alone in the feeling of satisfaction and joy that this cd causes in you. It will be a gift that you'll never forget."

"
My sister gave this cd to me as a joke. I was the first one to notice how good it was and how positive it was. I was surprised that she bought it for me, and I've been listening to it ever since. I feel like it's made me a lot happier. I like the lyrics, the music, and everything else about it. It really helped me out a lot. I would buy this cd again and again if I were ever in a bad mood."

"
This is a great cd. The songwriter, Michael Raynor, creates songs that make you feel good and make you feel proud. His songs are all positive and uplifting. It has a great feeling to it. I would recommend this cd to anyone in need of a positive song. Michael Raynor has a great voice and he is a great songwriter. I would recommend this cd to anyone in need of a song that will make them feel good. This is a great cd."

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This album is just not very good. The recording is good, but the performance is so bad, there is no use of the vocals, or anything else. It is just too much of the same boring music.

Amazon review: This album is a really interesting combination of old and modern, it is not a song-by-song record but a concept album. There are many songs in this album that seem to be about a particular person and their actions in the past, but each song reflects the changes that took place in the life of that person. There is also some very good poetry and drama in the lyrics, but the songwriting on this album is just not very good.

Amazon review: This album of song is pretty well done. I do not like everything about it, but the instrumentals are very good and the vocals are very good.

I just don't understand that.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: A lot of the classical music I've been listening to lately, the stuff that I've been buying, is not really "music" at all, but rather one long piece of garbage, that is played by a person who has forgotten how to sing, and is trying to be a rock star.  I have not gotten any enjoyment from it.  It doesn't take long to figure out that whatever is on the radio isn't really music.  The music that has been coming out of Europe is worse in quality,  however, it does have a few decent pieces.   The classical musicians are more like robots, than people.   I am a professional musician and performer, and I don't listen to any music that is not played in the concert halls here in the US, and is not a part of the music that we play in our music schools.   So, I can't get excited about listening to some of the music that is on the radio.   I can't use classical music as a way to get through the day.  I can't use it as a way to relax.   It is purely entertainment for losers.

Amazon review: I like the music and I like the instrumentals, but I always have to hear the same song over and over again to get a full enjoyment of it.   I have come to find that when you are playing the same song over and over again, your ear is going to get used to it, and will start to miss the subtle differences that make the song interesting.  My musical tastes are very eclectic,  so I've been trying to get a different type of music and I've been doing better,  as of late, finding new stuff to listen to,  that is more unique to me.  I love folk and bluegrass and classical, and jazz, and folk and bluegrass and classical, and jazz,  and so on and so forth.   I really like the classical music that I've been listening to lately,  but the classical music that I've been listening to recently,  have been a little too much like the classical music that I've been listening to lately,  and I've been listening to a lot of classical music, that I've been trying to get away from for years,  that is so similar to the classical music that I've been trying to get away from for years,  that I've finally figured out that I haven't been listening to the exact same stuff for years,   it's the same music,  but the artists who are playing it have changed,

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: This is the second record I've heard from a group that I've been a fan of for some time. I listen to them more than I used to.  The first being H.E.A.T.  And the two records are just as good.  This time some real quality is added to the group.  The tracks are more diverse and have a real quality that is lacking in the other group.  They also use the same producer,  Timbaland.  I am not a fan of Timbaland,  but I respect him and the group because he is a real producer.  If he would just release his own music he would be considered a genius.  The production on this album is top notch.  The only problem is that the artist has been taken over by a group of thugs who are not worthy of his talent.  I hope he comes out with another group of talented artists.   The only group of thugs I can listen to is the original group that was here first.  Those guys were the best.

The second was average.  This one is very disappointing.  This is a very bad album.  I will not listen to any of their new music.   This group needs to go back to the drawing board.  I will not even listen to the group,  except for  H.E.A.T.  If they do not make good music I will not listen to them.

Amazon review: A great album,  and on a good day it will be a great album.  The songwriting is excellent,  the production excellent,  and the mixing is excellent.  I have listened to this album on a few occasions now and the songs are all very good.  The only problem is that I do not think it will ever happen.  It seems that there are too many record labels out there that are controlled by the record company and they are trying to get back in to the artists name.  This is bad for the artist.  This album is a great album,  but it does not sound like the original group.  I did a search online and I found a review of the original group that is from 1992 and the group had released five albums.  I have read a few positive reviews and a few negative reviews.  It seems that there is nothing negative that I can add to this review.  I will say this;  if you are looking for a great album to release on RCA or Polygram or something that does not sound like a group that made records for the last 20 years they are not going to release it.  I have always been a fan of the original group and this album was a great one.  The songs are great,  the production is great,  the mixing is great,  and the songwriting is excellent.  This is a great album and it has not changed,  but it does not sound like it.  I have listened to it a few times and will not listen to it again.

I think the only thing was that the band wasn't really that great.  You can't really compare this album with the rest of the "B" albums.  There seems to be a little more variety with the music now.  I think this album could have been a little more consistent and the only complaint I have about this album is that it could have been better.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you like to sing and you like to play the piano.  If you like to sing and you like to play the piano.  I don't know what to say.  I have just been listening to this CD for two weeks and listening to it all the time.  I have been enjoying it immensely, and I have been playing it all the time.  I am not a fan of the songs, but I still really like it.  I have always been a fan of the band and  I will continue to listen to them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very good album from one of the better "old school" jazz artists of our time.  I love it when the music is played at the right tempo and with enough groove to keep the listener going. In addition to having a great sound, this CD has the most amazing musicians.  I really can't imagine anyone playing better music than Dallas Holm.  I am a huge fan of his music and will continue to buy his CD's.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I am not an albatross, I am not a hanger on.  I am an albatross.  My name is Jeff and I'm a fan.  I like to listen to music from many different genres, but I like jazz.  I love the music Dallas Holm's brings to the table, and I have been a fan of his for years.  I like the way he sounds and the way he plays the piano.  I like his voice, it has a different tone to it.  I like the way he plays the saxophone, and I like the way he plays the trumpet.  I like the way he plays the guitar, and I like the way he plays the bass guitar.  I also like the way he plays drums, and I like the way he plays guitar.  I like his band, I like the way he plays the piano and guitar with one instrument.  I like the way he plays the drums, and I like the way he plays the bass guitar.  I like the way he plays the trumpet, and I like the way he plays the saxophone.  I like the way he plays the saxophone and the trumpet at the same time, and I like the way he plays the saxophone and the trumpet in the same song.  I like the way he plays all the instruments on the same side of the keyboard, and I like the way he plays all the instruments on one side of the keyboard.  I like the way he plays the instruments, and I like the way he plays them.  I like the way he plays the different songs in the same album, and I like the way he plays the different songs in the same album.  I like the way he plays the different songs in the same cd.  I like his guitar playing, and I like the way he plays the piano.  I love the way he plays the piano.  I like the way he plays the percussion, and I like the way he plays the guitar.  I like the way he plays the bass guitar, and I like the way he plays the drums.  I like the way he plays the piano and guitar on the same song, and I like the way he plays the piano and guitar on the same side of the keyboard.  I like the way he plays the piano and guitar on the single side of the keyboard, and I like the way he plays the piano and guitar on the other side of the keyboard.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This album is a waste of time.  It is more a collection of mediocre, low-grade music.  I have listened to this album about five times now and I am not done.  It is repetitive and is about the same three times an hour, every five minutes and it is boring.  I will say that I have never heard anything like it and I have heard some of the best music in my life.  I will also say that the band is pretty good.  I can't tell much about the band.  I didn't listen to the songs very carefully and I don't really know a lot about the band.

In the first half of the CD the band is really tight,  but at the end of the CD you can tell that they are not as tight as they used to be.  I think the band is going into a more funk and funkier direction, but I'm not really sure.  I think I will keep listening to the CD,  I will just have to wait and see.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: The album "Songs For The Church" is wonderful - well worth the price of admission.  It is a wonderful collection of hymns and songs, all beautifully arranged and played.  I especially like the arrangement of the "Hymn to the King" and the "Hymn to the Blessed Virgin".  It is a pity that the music is so repetitive, but this is the fault of the arranger and not the singers.  This CD is a must have for any church or choral organization.  It is a musical treat for the eyes, ears, and heart.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I've been a big fan of The Warlocks since the first release in 2000, and have recently listened to their newest album, "Majestic". This album is another example of the bands original sound. The first song on the album, "Farewell, John" is what I listen to first. The songs on this album are very similar to the first, with a lot of dynamics, harmonies, and solos. The album is very easy, yet complex listening. The songs have a great flow to them, which gives the listener a chance to enjoy the music. Also, the lyrics are good on this album. I found the lyrics to be simple, yet meaningful.

Amazon review: This is a nice album.  It sounds like the music was recorded in the early 70's.  I like the album overall.  It has a nice mix of songs, but some are repetitive.  I like the songs but I have to say, they are repetitive.  The choral leader doesn't always get the best of the songs.  His arrangement sounds like he has limited knowledge of music and doesn't know how to get the best out of his songs.  The songs sound like they have been recorded in one take.  The songs that are repetitive are the ones that I found the most boring.  I would suggest that the arranger needs to take more time to get a better performance out of his songs.  I liked the other songs on the album very much.  The songs that are repetitive are the ones that I would not recommend buying.

Amazon review: I have listened to about 3/4 of this album and I like it.  The songs are interesting and they have a nice rhythm to them.  The choral leader has a nice voice and sometimes he sounds as if he is singing with his hands not his mouth.  He also gets a little carried away with the tempo with a lot of songs.  I also don't mind the repetitious nature of some songs.  The songs that are repetitive are the ones that I found the least interesting.  I would suggest that the arranger needs to take more time with his arrangements.  He seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove for most of the songs and rarely deviates from the original arrangement.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

I don't like the way the songs are arranged.  Maybe it's because I'm working night shift.  I like the songs with the chorus, but there seem to be a lot of songs with the chorus that don't have one.  The only song that I liked was "Lose Yourself."
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I liked the song.  I thought it was very good, but I was glad to see another copy of the album.  I wasn't sure why I was buying it, but I finally decided that I should buy it.  I have listened to it a few times.  I liked it, but I don't like the song as much as I thought I would.  I think this is Eminem's best album, or maybe his second best album, after "Hail Satan" (which was my favorite album).  The songs are very catchy, with the chorus.  I liked the lyrics.  I think the music is very easy to make.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I just bought this CD, and I was hoping to find it in my local market.  I had to buy it from a company online.  This is my first time buying an album, and I think I got a good deal.  I didn't have the money, so I didn't buy anything else.  It's $14.95.  It's the best thing I've bought so far, and I'm glad I did it.  I really like it.  The album is very enjoyable.  I'll be buying more albums in the future.  I don't know what I'll get in the future.  I don't want to buy a CD or an mp3.  I want to buy the album for sure.  I think I like this album, and it is definitely worth the money.  I think I'll give this album a 10 out of 10.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the first Eminem CD I've ever bought, so I'm not really sure what to say about it.  The album is very enjoyable, and I agree with other reviewers about the overall sound quality.  I do wish that the vocals weren't so over-the-top, though.  And I'm not a fan of the use of auto-tune on the chorus.  But that's just my personal opinion.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love what I hear on this album.  The vocals are fantastic, the songs are all a great listen, and the musicianship is outstanding.  The only sad thing about this album, is that there are some really awful songs on there.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album.  They are a band who I will continue to listen to, and I definitely recommend them.  The only thing that I can see them doing is making a new record with a different style of music.  I really like their sound and style, so I really hope that they do.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The group has been around for about a year now, and I'm always looking to check out new music.  So, I figured I would start off with their previous work and continue with their new work.  I like the sound of this album, but I must say that they need to tone down the vocals.  All of the vocals on this album, are just not there.  I would not recommend this to someone who has a weak stomach and is easily offended.

Amazon review: This is the third album that I have purchased from The White Stripes and I've really enjoyed the three that I've listened to.  The sound of this album is very different from the other two.  I don't know what it is, but I'm not crazy about the sound of this album.  It sounds like it belongs in a different era.  The vocals are OK, but I feel like the lyrics are a little simplistic and over all, it's just not for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is my third time listening to this album.  It is a great album that has a lot of great songs and the lyrics are a little bit heavy, but still enjoyable.

Amazon review: I have to admit that this album was the first one that I heard from the new band that I discovered a little over a year ago.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the new group and I am always trying to find new music to add to my collection.  Most of their albums have been good, but this one seems to have some flaws.

I would still recommend listening to this album, but just be aware that there are some flaws.
