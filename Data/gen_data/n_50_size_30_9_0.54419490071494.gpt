Amazon review: I would have given this one a 5 star even if it wasn't a Danzig song. The only thing I don't like about it is that there is only 11 songs on it... But if you like Danzig and you don't mind the lyrics, I would say go for it. I would rate it a 5 star.

Amazon review: I've really enjoyed both of these albums. The only thing that is wrong is I think they should've put a little bit more effort into making this a "real" cd instead of just a "best of" album. I think the songs are all good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, I would say it's the best of them all. The songs are all good, the production is top notch. What I don't like is that it's a bonus disc, so to speak. The best thing about this album is the fact that it contains the complete version of "Dancing With The Dead" and "All The Rage," two songs that never get played on many of the other albums.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The bonus disc is not a "bonus" it's just a collection of songs that never got played in the original release. The bonus disc is a collection of songs that never got played on the original release.

Amazon review: I bought this back on July and I haven't been able to get it to work. I have checked all the different settings on my laptop and computer and it still doesn't work. I bought this back in the beginning of the summer and it was supposed to get it working by now, but so far it has not. I am going to try to download it again but I am not sure how it will work. I hope I can get it to work so I can listen to it.

Amazon review: I love the music on this cd but the most important thing is the lyrics. I don't always like everything I listen to but the lyrics, the lyrics are what I love. The song "The Dark Side" has a great guitar solo... the song "Cemetery Gates" has a great guitar solo. I love the song "The Devil Went Down To Georgia". I think the lyrics are the best part of the cd. The rest of the songs are all great. The songs "Dancing With The Dead" and "All The Rage" are just awesome. The song "Dancing With The Dead" is one of the few songs on the cd that I can't get to work on my computer. I've tried everything... I can't even get it to work when I get it. I don't know what program I'm using. I don't think it even has a name so I can't even get it to work. It has the same problem where it says "Cannot connect to server" and I have to go to the server and choose the option to turn on and then it says it's trying to connect to the server when it should say "Cannot connect to the server" and then it says "Cannot connect to server because there are too many other users using the server." I keep getting this message over and over again when I try to connect to the server. I have read that you can turn off the firewall on your computer and I don't want to do that. I don't want to turn off the firewall because that would mean that I can't connect to the server and I don't want to turn off the firewall because I like the cd.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought the cd about a month ago. I am going to start downloading songs and if I don't like them I am going to return them. I like the songs on this cd and the lyrics are very well written. "Dancing with the dead" is my favorite. This is my first cd from Danzig and so far it has been a great cd.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I was hoping this would be better than the previous album, but it just isn't. It is okay. I am glad to have a Jewel CD that I can listen to for the first time in years. I do not listen to much music anymore, so I listened to some of her albums in the car. She's a great singer and she deserves more.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review:  I don't know about the rest of the album but this was one of the better songs  I believe the song is about the death of a friend of mine and my heart goes out to the family and friends who have lost one.  I'm not a big fan of the lyrics but I can see how the song could be interpreted in this way.  After listening to this song, I prayed for the loss of my friend and I've been able to let go of the thoughts and memories of the loss.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is not a "catchy" song.  The lyrics are beautiful and the choruses are catchy.  This was a very good song for the simple reason that I truly believe in the power of prayer.  I prayed for my father and the pain of his death was completely released.  I truly believe that prayer has power and that it is truly real.  I believe in prayer and that God answers our prayers.  I've prayed God's will for my family and received exactly what I asked for.  It is easy to pray and I'm sure the Lord has asked me questions over the years.  I'm sure he knows what I need but I refuse to listen to the answer.  Praying is a choice and I choose not to listen to what I'm not supposed to hear.  I chose to listen to God's will and I know that he knows my heart.  This song is a testament to the power of prayer.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have a friend that is a Christian and he always tells me how his heart goes out to the people who are hurting.  I don't have a heart for people who are hurting.  I am more of a heart of stone and I'm sorry to say this but I don't have a heart for people who are hurting.  I love this song but the lyrics make it sound as if you can hear the pain and heartache in my voice.  I've never said or sung anything that has hurt me in my life.  If those words have ever been said by me, I am sure that I would have left them out of my words. I don't believe in hurting people.  I believe in loving people.  I believe in God and his love for me.  I love this song because I believe that God loves me.  I believe that I am very loved and that his love for me is so great that he has chosen to let me know that he is in my life.  I've been a Christian for as long as I can remember.  I was born a Christian and I have never stopped being a Christian.  I have never had a Christian experience that I didn't enjoy.  I've never been to church and I've never been to a prayer meeting and I've never attended a spiritual retreat.  I have had a loving relationship with my parents and I've had a loving relationship with my husband.  I've had a loving relationship with my children.  I've never had a friend or a loved one that told me that I wasn't worth loving or that I wasn't worth anything.  I believe in God and that God's love for me is so great that he has chosen to let me know he is in my life.  I believe in prayer and that God answers his prayer.  I've prayed God's will for my family and received exactly who I asked for.  I believe that God knows exactly who I need and that he wants to use me to reach the lost, the lonely and the hurting.  I believe that God has given me a heart that is great and if he will have me to share his love and his grace and his goodness with others, he will make me a better person who will bring him glory.  I believe that God loves me and that he has chosen to let me know that he is in my life and that he wants to use me to reach the lost, the lonely, the hurting.  I've never felt more loved and wanted and more loved than I feel right now in this moment.  I've never felt more needed and more wanted than I feel right now in this moment.  I've never felt so alone and so needed and so loved than I feel right now in this moment.  I believe in God and that God is so great and so wise and that he has chosen to let me know he is in my life.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I'll buy this CD if I hear her cover of Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" any day. If only I could get her to play it live, as far as I'm concerned, it's the best CD I've ever heard. I'm sick of hearing that tune on the radio. Just as an aside, I don't know how she gets away with such high notes on most of her songs.

Amazon review: I've been listening to her for a while and have always liked her. This is the best album of her I've heard so far. I like to think of it as a compilation CD. Most of her songs are good, but there's one song that's really disappointing. I can't get past the fact that she seems to have lost that great, relaxed quality. I'd like to listen to it again, but I wouldn't want to have to hear it all again.

Amazon review: This is Meghan Trainor's second album. I like the first one and I'm still waiting for the third. I think the album is great; the songs are great. But I don't think I'm the problem! I'm just not the most enthusiastic person on the planet when it comes to her music. I still listen to her music, but it's not on a regular basis. I'm not sure what the problem is, but I think it's something with the vocals. It's just not my type of music. If I was to listen to this album on a regular basis, it would just be a waste of time.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a good listen. It's nice to have some songs that don't sound like anything by artists you've heard before. I've heard a few of her songs before and they're enjoyable. I don't like how many times she tries to be different. The songs are all good, though. I'm glad I listened to this album because I'm interested in hearing more from her. I like her voice a lot, so I'll probably want to check out her other albums, as well.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this is the best album to date. I agree with most of the other reviews; it has good songs. I never thought I'd love a singer like Trainor. It's kind of sad that she's become a "pop star." To me, her music hasn't changed much. I think she's done a great job and I'll be checking out her other albums. I don't think I'm the problem. I just don't like the vocals in this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Twiztid, I don't know whether to be disappointed or delighted. I am sure there are a lot of Twiztid fans out there. I was a long time Twiztid fan who had to be dragged out of the dark ages to get a CD in the early 80's when the band had a new album out. The record was a great success. I still have a copy of it and it is the only CD I own that is still in mint condition.  The band has a few more albums out now, but none of them have made as much an impact on me as before.  The last album they did was about as good as the group could pull off, but this one is not nearly close to it.  I used to like the band back in the mid-80's, but I don't like the band on this album.   This is a very boring CD with very little redeeming qualities. They are not very innovative, but there is nothing really wrong with the music, it just does not grab me.  The band is great, and I like them as a group, but this CD just doesn't do anything for me.  I will still buy it, but I don't want to get a new CD from the band.

Amazon review: This is a good CD. It has good lyrics and it has a few decent songs. The only problem is that it has a lot of filler. It is the same album that everyone keeps buying.  Overall, it was a good album. I would recommend buying it but just be aware that it may not be worth much of what you pay for it.

Amazon review: I've heard a lot of people talk about this album, but I have never bought it. If you have the money, it is worth it. This is a great album. I am not a huge Twiztid fan, but this album is really good. It is a good album for people who like to listen to hip-hop, but don't care too much about the lyrics.   I would say that it is a worthy addition to your collection.   I would say that it is worth the money but only if you can get the CD at an affordable price.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.
