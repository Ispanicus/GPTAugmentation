Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I'm so dissappointed by this album. I was really hoping for something new and different. I expected this album to be very emotional and this was absolutely not that. It's just the same old, same old. I know there's more to this artist than her music, but I just can't stand it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I can’t find a good way to write a review about this album. First off, while the album was really good, there was a lot more production on this album than the first. The first album has a pop feel to it. The second album is a little more rock. It has a more traditional feel to it. The songs are catchy, but the songs are not that catchy. That is the only thing I can think of that I can say about this one is that it was good.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: The song is beautiful, but the music is very, very good, too. I can't really put my finger on it, but I feel like the music is more important than the song itself. Some songs just sound like they were recorded in a vacuum. I could have made the same comments about this track as I did about the first track on the album, but I think that's because I'm in a different place emotionally and musically. I love the first track, but I love the second track even more. The second track is just as good as the first track, and if anything, it's even better. Maybe I'm a little too sensitive about this, but I think it's because the second track is more interesting overall, and the first track is just a little too simple and predictable. The second track is a great example of what I'm talking about. It's a little bit more thought provoking, and I think that's why I love it so much. I think I'd be more comfortable with a song that's more than just a two minute pop tune, but I just don't know if I could ever put myself into the mindset of just listening to an entire album and not choosing which songs to listen to and which songs to skip. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. The songs on this album are all pretty good, and I think if you have a weak spot in your heart, this album will fill it.

This is one of the worst worship cd's I have ever heard. The songs are all uninspired, uninspired, and the lyrics are poorly written and are not even close to being Biblical. The only people who should listen to this are people who enjoy looking at pictures of dogs. There are a few songs that are very catchy and are great but most of them are not worth listening to. You can find some of the songs on their website. The singing is awful. The sound is bad. The sound quality is bad. The production is bad. The video is very bad. This is not a very good cd.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review:  This CD has a strong positive message for Christian,  Positive messages are everywhere you look on the internet.  I am only providing one negative review because I am not the type to do that.  I have had the CD before but had not gone thru the CD's before.  I have had it before and do not want to do that again.  I would buy the CD again.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the CD is not the best quality.  There are a couple tracks that are very distorted.  The sound quality is fine and the cd will not be a problem for most people.  I will say that I purchased it from the same website to which I have a bad experience with.  I will let you know when I go through the CD's.

Amazon review: I really liked the song  "Thank You Lord"  It reminded me of being thankful to the Lord.  It was one of the few songs I could even sing along to. The rest of the songs were not great.  I like the song  "I Will Not Leave Jesus Again"  It was very good but I am not sure if the song was actually written for a specific person or just a general message that we can be thankful to the Lord.  If you like Christian music, you will like this CD.

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of Christian Music.  I like the songs on this CD but I cannot sing.  There are about 8 songs on the CD that I could sing along to but I could not sing most of it.  I did not like the songs,  I was hoping they would be songs that I could sing along to.  I bought this CD because I enjoy Christian Music.  I am not Christian, I have been to church about 8 times.  I would like a Christian Music CD to listen to.  I did not download a song for this review.

Amazon review: I have listened to Christian music since I was a teenager.  I have listened to the CD a few times,  I do not know why I do not like Christian music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: One of Schubert's finest works, this is a collection of works that were written for various kinds of chorus, all of which are a part of this collection. The Schubertian works included are the two songs for solo voice, the two songs for chorus, as well as a song for two voices, the two songs for two choirs, the three songs for a single voice, the song for two choirs, a song for solo violin, and three songs for solo flute.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD features two complete unaccompanied piano works. The First Piano Sonata is a sonata for piano which, in my opinion, is Schubert's best work and probably the best known one. The Second Piano Sonata is a sonata for piano which is not as well known. The music is in the same style as the first piano sonata and the piano parts are not as well recorded. The recording features the pianist Peter Serkin who is a very good pianist. Overall, this is an excellent set that is well priced and is worth the price.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first work on this album is the sonata, which is beautifully written and played and is a very well known work. The second and final work on the album is a short song for solo flute, this is Schubert's last great work and has recently been recorded in the New World Recorders. The recording is not the best I have heard.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: After listening to all the music on this CD, my only complaint is that none of the songs are more than 2 minutes long. Most of the songs are shorter than this and the performances of them are very good. Also, the recordings are very poor quality--the sound is so poor that it is impossible to really get the full impact of the music. I would not recommend this CD at all because of the recording quality.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a collection of two piano concertos, one which is not very well known and one which is well known. The music here is written and played in the same style as the first piano concerto and the piano parts are not as well recorded. The recording features the piano player Peter Serkin. This is an excellent collection of both piano concertos, and the performance is very good. The recording quality is quite good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a collection of two piano concerti with different keys and two different sets of arrangements. The first set of arrangements is for cello and piano. The second set of arrangements includes piano and cello with an arrangement for the cello which is also done in the same style as one of the piano concertos. The recording features the pianist Peter Serkin. This is a very good collection of the two piano concerti, and the performance is very good. The recording quality is quite good, and I think it is a very good value.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an excellent collection of Schuberts music. The first sonata was written for him by his pupil Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. I had been looking for this for years, as he never recorded it. This collection includes a sonatina and the Gavotte. The recording is excellent. The first sonata has been recorded several times and is now re-recorded by the New World Recorders. The sound is very good and the performance is excellent. The second sonata has been recorded several times and is now re-recorded by New World Recorders. The sound is excellent and the performance is excellent.

Amazon review: I think this is the best album by Danzig (not by the band) yet it is extremely hard to understand.  For this reason, it is not a best of.  It is a good album but the lyrics are hard to understand.  The singing isn't bad, but the lyrics are pretty bad. The lyrics are like "I'm going to have my way with you" type of lyrics and "I'll take you home tonight" type of lyrics.  It's not bad, but it just makes it extremely hard to understand.  If you enjoy the band, I would recommend this album, but I don't think it is a must have.

It wasn't a hit, but it was a hit.  I will listen to it again.  For those of you who want to buy this CD and don't know a song that is a hit, check for the hit songs and then find a song that is a hit on the website, and then get the song.  Then if you want to buy it, you will know if the song is a hit, and then you'll know what to do with it.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I saw this show in the spring of 1999 and it was a great show, but I think it was probably my fault. I got to the West End, and before the show started, my friend started screaming at me, "Oh my God you are so beautiful, you are so beautiful, you are beautiful, you are so beautiful, you are so beautiful, you are so beautiful, you are..." I can't remember what happened after that, but I remember the show. I was so excited to see this show, but that was my fault. I should have listened to my friend. He was right.

Amazon review: I am an opera fan and I am a fan of the West End.  I have seen every opera this year and this is not a show for the faint of heart or weak of will. This is a show where you really have to have the heart and the will to see what you have been waiting your whole life for.  It is a show where you can get lost in the beauty and the sorrow and the sadness and the hope of the characters.  This is a show where you can get the chance to be in the moment.  It is a show where you can get the chance to feel the love of your life.  It is a show where you can feel the pain of your life.  I am a huge fan of the West End and I will be there every night of the month of Feburary.  I will be there every night of the month of March.  I will be there every night of the month of April.

This is not a show for those who have seen every opera on the calendar for the past year.  It is a show where you really have to be there as an audience member to see what you have been waiting for your whole life. This is a show where you really have to be there as an artist to see what you have been waiting to be an artist. It is a show where you really have to be there to feel the love of your life. It is a show where you really have to be there to feel all the pain of your life.  It is a show where you really have to be there to feel all of the joy of your life.  It is a show where you really have to get to your seats to feel what you are looking for in your life.  It is a show where you really have to get your ticket to feel what you are looking for in your life. It is a show where you really have to be there as an audience to feel what you are looking for in your life.  It is such a heart breaking show.  It is such a moving show.  It is such a beautiful show.  It is such a wonderful show.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  I have now purchased this 4 times, and the first time I bought it I was not pleased with the quality of tracks.  What I didn't realize is that the tracks are not all from the same album.  I was told that at the time that the album comes in 2 sets, the set with the 2nd disk has the same tracks as the first disk, except with different vocals.  But I have now had 2 sets of this album, and it is clear that is not the case.  The quality of the tracks on each disc are different.  The album is more a collection of songs than an album of tracks.  There are some songs that are very nice, some others that are mediocre.  But the quality of the tracks is not the problem.  The problem is the repeated structure and the "sound" of the tracks.  There are a few tracks that are repeated and just do not have a good quality feel or emotion.  The music is also very repetitive and seems to sound the same no matter what.  The music does hold a great deal of emotion, and the choral parts are very beautiful.  I just wish the tracks were a little more varied.  I love the music, I just wish the tracks were a little more diverse.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for a good love song. I'm also a sucker for a good Christmas song, and I love them both. This one's no exception. The song is lovely, with some great lyrics and a simple melody. The only thing I would add is that the lyrics are really long and would probably take up half the song. I would have liked to see more melody in the song, but the verse isn't as bad as you would expect. Overall, this is a very good love song, and a great Christmas song.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I love the song "No More, No Malice."  I love the song "No More, No Malice" because it is such a great song and I love how it combines with "No More" to make a very solid song.

I also like that song because it is in the background during "No More" and makes it not so loud.

Amazon review: Very good album.  I like it because it is well produced and it is just the same ol' same ol' from Twiztid.  If you are like me and wish there was more music like "No More, No Malice" then you will like this album.  I have bought all the Twiztid albums and have never been disappointed with a single album.  This album is definitely a good listen too.  All the songs are good but some are better than others.  Some of the songs have an amazing hook and some just don't work as well.  All in all I love this album.  I love Twiztid.

I know a lot of people like the "No More, No Malice" song but I don't.  It's a good song but I don't like the background vocals on this song.  I would say that this song is good but not the best.  There is a lot of variety in the album with different styles in the songs.  Overall I would say that this album is a good album.
