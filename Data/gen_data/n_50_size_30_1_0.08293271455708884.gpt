Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This album is very, very boring.  This album is so boring that I was actually hoping it would be a great song but it is just nothing.  I would have preferred if there was a few more songs.  The only great song on this album is "It's Over" which I feel is the best song on the album.  There are many songs on this album that are just boring.

Amazon review: This is my second trip to Twiztid after hearing a demo of this song and I think it is a very solid song.  I do not think the song is very good but I do not think it is the worst song on the album.  I think is very strong in my opinion.  I thought the first half of the song was very good and I thought the second half of the song was very weak.  It seemed like the second half was out of place.  At first I thought it was a bit out of place but as I listened to the song again it just seemed to fit very well with the song as a whole.  I think the song is good but I do not think I would listen to it again.  I think the song may be too good for other people to listen to and I do not think other people would want to listen to it either.  I think it is a good song, but I think it is just not a very good song.  I do not like the song in general.  I do not think it is very good.  I do not like the song at all, but the song is very strong.  I think the song is very strong.  I think the song is very strong and I do not think the song is very good.  The song is very good.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This band has a wonderful sound and is highly varied.  If you're looking for a choral group with a unique sound, look no further than the Dallas Holm Ensemble.  This is one of the best CDs I've ever heard.  I could listen to this CD non-stop for an hour and never get tired of it.  The only songs that seem to drag are the more upbeat ones.    The arrangements are excellent and range from classic to modern.    The songs are all beautifully sung and arranged.

Amazon review: This CD is amazing!! It's a very impressive collection of choral music that is very well-crafted.  I was quite surprised when I first heard this CD because it was very different from any choral CD I have ever heard.  It's not exactly what I am looking for, but it's still very enjoyable.  I actually have to turn it off and listen to the other CD that I am trying to listen to because it is a little too loud.    The choral arrangements are simple and very well-written, and the music is well-arranged with a sound that is very varied.  The songs are well-sung and well-played.  The CD is well-made and will appeal to a wide range of people.    I would recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in finding a new CD to listen to.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have been a big fan of Meghan Trainor since her days of The Voice. Her new music is beautiful but I'm not interested in it.  This is the kind of album that you should enjoy, but not be drawn into. I guess I'll be looking forward to her new album in 2021.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have enjoyed every single song on this album. It's so refreshing to find a young songwriter with such talent. I found her style of songwriting to be refreshing but the lyrics are still too personal for me.  It's like she is trying to give a message that she can't give through song. I don't know if that's the case or not. I'll probably listen to the rest of it, but I will not buy this album.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Meghan Trainor since her days of The Voice. Her music is gorgeous and she has a great voice.  But her songs are now too personal for me.

Amazon review: I'm an amateur musician and have a passion for the arts.  I love the arts and artistry, so this was my first CD purchase.  The music is beautiful and the lyrics have a message.  I was a very faithful listener to this CD, but could never find the words to describe my experience with this album.  I just loved the music.  I found myself in the background of each song and didn't need to talk during the song.  I found myself listening to this CD in the car.  The only problem I have with this CD is the message.  It's not for my ears only.  I don't know why I'm hearing this message.  It's not a message that I want to hear.  The only message I hear is that we are all a part of the human race and God loves us all.  That's it.  The rest of the messages are just a bunch of empty words and have no meaning to me.  I don't know why I'm hearing this message.  I don't even care.

Amazon review: I've listened to a lot of music and this is one of my favorites.  It's really simple and simple lyrics but the music is so rich and beautiful.  This is one of my favorite songs on the album.  It's called 'I'm the One For You' and I love it. I don't believe in love songs.  I think love songs lead to a lot of heartache and arguments.  I don't believe in love songs.  I don't ever want to hear a love song.  This song and album was a breath of fresh air.  I had no idea there was music like this.  It's a message that I feel I need to hear more.  I don't understand why I can't hear this message.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: The vocals are strong, and Danzig can carry his voice well.  The musicianship is a bit hit and miss on this album.  The album has a lot of great songs, but the album is so repetitive, you can only listen to it once and not like to listen to it again - it is very annoying.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is all about a man named Libera.  Libera is a poet and singer who was once a member of the band Kissin' Time.  This album is very much about Libera and his journey from Kissin' Time to Libera.  The album is all about his journey and how Libera feels about the world, and Libera's journey.  The album is about Libera's struggle in life and how he thinks about life.  Libera is a man who hates the idea of war and wants to start a world where peace is made.  He believes the world is like a glass of water, and the pieces of the glass that are made in the world are all part of the world that comes before us.  Libera is a man who believes that all men are equal and has a great heart.  This album is about Libera's journey and how he thinks about life.  This album is about Libera's struggle in life and how he thinks about the world.

The only problem is that the CD-R has a tendency to get dirty, and it is impossible to erase the tracks on it.  There is no way I could get back the original tracks from the cd rw without burning the whole cd.  If you take the CD-R out and set it down, it will get dirty again.  I do not know of another way to get the whole cd without having to buy a new one.  I have been using this CD in my car, and I have never had any problems.  If you have any problems with the CD, maybe you need a new player and a new player case.

Hi Mike,

Hope you had a good weekend.  I hope you like the new music I sent to you.
I
really liked it.  It was very relaxing.  I'll get some more CDs for you
next
week.  I'm trying to get some for the office too.  I'll let you know when
I
have them.  I hope you get a chance to listen.  I know you like to listen
to
music while you work.  I hope you had a chance to listen to the music
while
you were at work.  I'll let you know how it was.  I was just wondering if
you
were going to be in today.  I know you have other things to do.  I hope
you
get a chance to listen to the music.  I know it was very relaxing.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the Schubert music, I mean, I am a Schubert fan.  I have listened to him more than any other composer, in any genre, in any form.  Even before Schubert I can say that I had developed an appreciation for the works of Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Wagner, and Haydn.  Schubert is the one composer who is truly the "King of the Composer's".  This is one of the few reasons why I love Schubert, and why I became a composer.  I have a special place in my heart for Schubert's four-part song cycle 'Unfinished'  (which was actually only a two-part song cycle as the second one was lost and never produced).  This album is full of the most wonderful songs, and, frankly, I have not heard such a large collection of Schubert songs in my life.  I have listened to some of the songs, and they are all really wonderful.  The problem is that Schubert's music is not easy to produce.  There are a few composers who are better at making the music easy to produce, like Mozart, Beethoven, and Wagner.  In Schubert's case, it's hard to make it easy to produce.  The reason why this album is so good is because it is full of the most wonderful songs.  I love Schubert's music and I love the works of Mozart, Beethoven, and Wagner.  So, the first thing I will say is that this album is full of the most wonderful songs.  I don't know about the other songs, but I don't think that they are too bad.  The problem is that "Unfinished" is full of the most wonderful songs.  I know that it is very difficult to find good songs for the two songs that are missing.  I know that I can't wait to hear what they come up with next.  The problem is that the songs that are on this album are really wonderful.  I don't know about the other songs, but I don' t know that they are too bad.  But, the problem is that the songs that are on this album are really wonderful.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this album a few times and I find it very interesting because I don't like Schubert, I don't like Mozart, I don't like Beethoven.  I like Schubert, Mozart, Beethoven, and a few other composers.  I will listen to this album again.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this album because I love Schubert, and I love his music, but the whole set of the "Four-Part Song Cycle Unfinished" is really, really, really good, better than "The Four-Part Song Cycle" which is a great work, and the whole set of the "Four-Part Song Cycle Unfinished" are very, very, very good.  (I also bought the "Four-Part Song Cycle" because it is a wonderful work and I like Mozart, too.)  However, the whole set of the "Four-Part Song Cycle Unfinished" (which is the only set I've ever bought because I love Schubert, but I love Mozart, Beethoven, and Wagner, too) is good because everything that is on it is good.  This CD is a great collection of great music, and I love Schubert and I love Mozart and I love Beethoven, but I don't like Schubert, and I don't like Mozart, and I don't like Beethoven.  It all makes a great CD, and I will buy this CD again and again.  I love Schubert, and I love Mozart, and I love Beethoven, and I love Wagner, and I only like these three.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have not heard this opera before, and I am really pleased with the performance.  I have heard the aria "The Bluebird" before, and I love it.  But, I have to be honest about the performance of this aria.  I thought that it was very good, but it has a very, very high register.  It has a very, very high, high, high, high, very high, very high, very high, very high, very high, high, very high, high, high, very high, very, high, very high, very high, very high, very high.  And, the second aria is just a little bit too high, too.  The third aria is a little bit too high

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: A nice album.  Although the songs seem a little monotonous, this is a good listen.  I think the only song that is a little too long is "It's A Wonderful Life."  The other songs are average, but for the most part, have a nice feel to them.  I especially like the way that the song "My Heart Belongs To You" is sung.  I would recommend this CD for people who like to sing a little, but don't want to sing a lot.  (There is a very good reason why that song is so long.)  There are a few songs that, don't seem to go anywhere.  I didn't really like the way this album ended.  I think the song "Bethlehem" is just a little too long.  But it was a good album.

Like the music makes me feel happy and I know that I will enjoy it.  When I first heard the album I thought, "Wow!  This is really nice."  After listening to it, I could tell, "Wow!  I need to buy more of this."  This CD is very good.  I think I am going to have to buy a couple more albums to get the full effect of it.

Music in The News

News for March 30th, 2004

Singer and songwriter Justin Timberlake's upcoming album will include "Suit & Tie," a song about two lovers who don't speak at first, but learn to communicate as the relationship progresses.  "I'm not going to say that they're the perfect couple, but I do think that they're one of the most perfect couples that ever existed," Timberlake said.  "I don't think they're a perfect couple.  I think they're just two individuals who are both trying to find the same kind of love.  And I think that's probably the most perfect love that ever existed, and it's something that's gonna help both of them."  Timberlake will start his new album with a tour in April with Faith Hill and will also perform at the Super Bowl halftime show.

The song "Can't Stop the Feeling," which was originally recorded and released by Aerosmith on their 1986 album '...And Here's the News,' will be used as the theme song for the movie "Dangerous Minds," due in theaters on February 14, 2004.  "We did 'Suit & Tie' with Faith Hill and they're going to

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

They have been on the radio and they seem to be doing pretty well.  I'm sure they will be able to release a single with the right hook and make this album better.

Amazon review: I recently got Twiztid's second album, "Twiztid 2".  I have to say, Twiztid has grown and progressed to the point where I see him as a legit artist.  I love the way he writes songs and puts together the music.  My only complaint with this album is that the lyrics are completely generic and unoriginal.  "The Realest" is the only song that I feel is worth the listen.  The rest of the album just feels like filler and does not bring the same feeling that it used to.  "The Realest" is an excellent song.  Great hook and the beat is perfect.  The lyrics are so clever.  I would love to hear more music from Twiztid.  I am a huge fan of his and will continue to support him.  I will continue to buy his music and help him in any way that I can.  I have to say that this album is a must have for every Twiztid fan.

Amazon review: Twiztid is back with a vengeance with album number three.  I will admit that when this album first dropped I was a little disapointed with the sound.  Twiztid has been trying to get back to his old sound for a while now and it seems to be working.  I'm not sure if it's the fact that Twiztid has been taking time to work on his music, or that he's just been working on his craft.  Either way, I'm glad to see Twiztid is back.  Twiztid's raps are great and he even manages to work in a few of the old Twiztid rhymes and flows here and there.  The production on this album is very solid.  I have to say that the first album was a little lacking in the production department.  With this album Twiztid has returned to his old sound and I feel that he has surpassed his previous albums in production and flow.  His voice just sounds so natural.  I don't think I would be so quick to write in a negative way about this album.  I would say that this album is very solid and I highly recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: TwizTid is a good rapper but he has never really hit the level that he is right now.  He has always had one of the best raps.  The same can be said for his record, he is not at the same level as his previous album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
