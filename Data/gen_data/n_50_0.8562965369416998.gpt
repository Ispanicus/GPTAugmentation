Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: A lot of these songs sound like they're on the radio.  The band is a very good band but the material they've put out for sale is a lot of filler.  I would like to know if the band is planning on releasing any more material.  I don't think they need to.

I get the feeling it was recorded in the early 2000's when they were still in college.  Don't be fooled by the good reviews.

Amazon review: This album was made right before the members of The Who were turning 30.  So, what you have here is an album that is pretty much a celebration of the band's 30th anniversary.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I am a singer and play guitar. I am not a musician so I have the experience to see if something works. But, I am learning a lot. I have been listening to different songs and trying to come up with my own arrangements and melodies to sing. I have a friend who has been singing in a small group for years and I am taking this class and trying to figure out that he has the same songs I do so that we can work together. My friend is an excellent singer and I am hoping that this class will help me to see my own talent. I like the different songs; I like the techniques that are presented. I think this is a fun class. It is not a "sing right" class or a "sing left" class. I think it is a great class to have when you are trying to get over a shyness or when you are not that good yet to start singing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am going to try this class out. If I like it, I will purchase it on my own. The class is taught by a professional singer, but not in a strict format. I am only paying $15.00 for this class at all. I wish I would have known about this course before I purchased my own singing lessons. I am trying to get over my shyness so I can sing again, but I have been self-conscious about it for years. I think this class is a great class to start out with. Thank you!

I will say that this song is nothing spectacular, but I'm not going to write a review for a song I didn't like, just because it's just a song.

I've spent probably 6 hours listening to this song, and I can listen to this song all day, but I just can't listen to it anymore.  I'm not a fan of her voice, I don't really know why, but it just makes me uncomfortable.  I don't think this song is very catchy or memorable, and it's just not something I'd buy.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Another collection of works that has been recorded for many years.  We have heard this album many times, and it always has the same wonderful music.  The only thing that I would like to improve on would be the male voices.  For example, I really like the "Blessed Are You" and "Joy" in the album, but in the male chorus, I'm not at all pleased with the sound of the male voices.  The male voices don't have the depth that they do in the female voices.  The female voices especially sound tired and old.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: After hearing a couple of the tracks on the CD, I thought that I had heard something that sounded good, something that I liked. Unfortunately,  the rest of the album was very disappointing.  The other tracks on the CD are bland and uninteresting.  I cannot say that this album is really different from the other albums I have listened to by Libera.  The sound quality was great, the songs were different but the same.  This is not a great album. It is very average.

It is a little bit better than most of the other albums that I have listened to that are by Libera.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

What I have taken from this album is that Twiztid is an old man and that he may not be the best singer at this point in time.  I liked the album but it's time to move on to something newer.  I will most likely purchase this album again.  This is the only album that I have listened to other than the songs on the video.  I have listened to a couple of other songs on mixtapes and YouTube.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Dallas Holm's since hearing his first CD in the early '70s.  I have a lot of his music, but his CD entitled "The Message from Dallas Holm" is by far the most memorable.  It is the most complete collection of Holm's music I have ever heard.  Dallas Holm wrote and sang the songs which are sung by his live band.  The songs are very personal and personal to Holm.  They were written in response to questions he was asked about God, Christ, the Bible and life.  The audience at this concert was made up of mostly Christians, but some unbelievers were there as well.  Holm also gave a short message about the importance of having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  The other features on the CD are the CD booklet, photos of Holm, photos of his band and photos of his family.  The music is very enjoyable, I enjoy it very much.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is a classic.  It's hard to choose between the two.  Holm's message may be the most important part of Holm's music.  The other parts include the sound quality and the instrumentation.  I personally like the instrumentation better and the sound quality just about as good.  Both are fine, but I would have to give the edge to the instrumentation.  Holm's message is really the best part.  I will agree with you that the sound quality may not be as good as the other two, but it is a fine CD which is more than adequate for a Christian.

I can definitely tell that this group has a lot of talent and that it is going to be a great success in the music industry.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This song was a staple of my high school concert band.  Our band director, Mr. A, was a bit of a douche and he didn't particularly care for this song.  It was a piece I wrote about my best friend growing up.  He thought it was a bit too personal and he didn't like it.  The second I saw this song I knew I had to have it.  It is just so beautiful.  I'm not sure how I'll remember the first line, but I know the rest will be burned into my mind forever.

Amazon review:  I love this song and I think it is the best "rock" version of "Happy Birthday".  I have used this song as a ring tone on my cell phone.  I am still amazed that I have not lost it.  This song is great for teaching kids.  I would highly recommend this song to anyone teaching piano.

Amazon review:  I really liked this song.  It was the first song I learned (I think) to play on a piano and it took me awhile to get the hang of it (but I did).

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The first disc has the complete Schubert works for piano. The second disc has Schubert's complete works for cello.

Amazon review: This CD does not contain any of the classics you would expect to hear on a Schubert collection. Instead, it presents works by composers such as Stravinsky, Beethoven, Rachmaninov, Stravinsky and others. The recording is very good, with the exception of the performance of the piano concerto for four hands by the pianist Mark Padmore. The recording is very good, but Padmore's playing is not up to the level of the other works in the disc.

The cello songs are quite lovely and all three of the cello works (concertos) are very fine.

The music of Mozart (c. 1781-1791) is considered one of the greatest works of Western art music. Mozart studied at the Vienna Conservatory and won several important competitions.

This is a set of five CDs (one for each of the five movements of the Sonata for 2 Violins and Piano). The Sonatas for Two Violins and Piano were composed by Mozart in 1782, during his tenure as Court Kapellmeister to Joseph II of Austria. They are considered to be among Mozart's greatest works. Mozart's first symphony, "The Magic Flute," was composed during this time. These five works are:

1. Sonata for Two Violins and Piano in A major, K. 622

2. Sonata for Two Violins and Piano in B-flat major, K. 623

3. Sonata for Two Violins and Piano in D-flat major, K. 624

4. Sonata for Two Violins and Piano in C major, K. 625

5. Sonata for Two Violins and Piano in E-flat major, K. 626

Disc one of the set features Mozart's Sonata for Two Violins and Piano in A major, K. 625: It is the first movement that is featured on this disc.

Disc two of the set features another sonata, this one in B-flat major, K. 623.

Disc three of the set features Mozart's Sonata for Two Violins and Pianoforte in D-flat major, K. 626: It is the third movement that is featured on this disc.

Disc four of the set features Mozart's Sonata for Two Violins and Organ in F major, K. 628: It is the fourth movement that is featured on this disc.

Disc five of the set features Mozart's Sonata for Two Violins and Oboe in C major, K. 640: It is the fifth movement that is featured on this disc.

This is a great set of music that you can listen to anytime, anywhere.

Amazon review: Oh the music of the New York Philharmonic! The New York Philharmonic!

Amazon review: My husband and I really enjoyed the last show of the two nights we attended, and we are really glad we made a night of it. However, we have to say, that this opera was a disappointment. It is not a true opera, and it is not a beautiful opera. The music is too loud and the sound quality is horrible. The only positive note is that the opera was performed at the Music Circle Theater, which is a fantastic modern opera house.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I saw it in the theater and it was wonderful.  I thought it was a great show.  I was surprised that it was not better in the movie, since the movie version is a Broadway show.  I did not see the Broadway version.  I will probably see the Broadway version, as my friend said he would.

Amazon review: It's just a great show.  I saw the movie first, and then got to see the show and was amazed.  It was so good that I have to see the Broadway show, too.  The show is just amazing.  I really think that it is going to take Broadway by storm, and it will be a great show.

Amazon review: I was not a fan of "Rent" when I first saw it, but I have to say, "Rent" is an absolutely amazing musical.  It's actually the second Broadway show I've seen this year, and it was simply amazing.  The cast was excellent, and the show is so well done.  I can't wait to see it on Broadway.  It's so funny, and the songs are wonderful.  I have to give "Rent" a five star rating.

Amazon review: Great show, and such a fun movie to watch.  I have to say, I was not a fan of the first movie (I am an old school "comedy" guy) but this film was entertaining and I will definitely watch it again.  The show was great, and I really think it is going to become one of the best shows on Broadway.

Amazon review: I do not believe this movie is the best that it could be.  I am not sure what it is, but I feel that it could have been better.  I saw it because of the music.  The songs in the movie were actually very good.  I have to give the movie a seven star rating.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Thalia is a very talented singer, but this CD proves that she has lost the ability to sing anything other than the same old ballads.  She has no vocal training or ability.  She is a very boring singer, and this album is a waste of time.  I don't know anything about the lyrics, and the CD is way too long for me to listen to.

Amazon review: I love the sound of this group, I really listen to them from time to time and I'm really looking forward to see them live soon.  I love the song "The Secret", I love the lyrics of "You Can't Make A Woman Love You" and of course, I love the other songs, but I'm not a fan of the whole group, I don't like the way they sound, I don't like the way they perform and I don't like the way they look.  They are all white and they have this strange way of singing and their clothes are very strange.  They are not the most beautiful thing that I've seen on TV and on the radio.  I'd rather listen to "The Secret", I'd rather listen to "You Can't Make A Woman Love You" and of course, "La Vida Es Un Carnal" (The Life is a Carnival), but I'm not a fan of the whole group, I don't mind listening to the rest, but I don't like the way they sound and I don't like the way they look.  I'd rather listen to "The Secret", I'd rather watch "Miami Vice" and "Miami Vice 2" (I know, I know, I don't like them), but I'm not a fan of the group, I don't like the way they look, and I don't like the way they sing.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this song.  I really enjoyed it back in my early college years.  I didn't have a whole lot of friends at the time, and I didn't listen to much music.  I think it's one of those songs that people who think they know music just can't help but like.  When I listen to it now, I like it, and I like it a lot.  But I think the lyrics are a bit off.  I like the song a lot, but the lyrics make me sound like I need a lifeguard.  I'm gonna change them, though.  At least that's how I feel.  Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
