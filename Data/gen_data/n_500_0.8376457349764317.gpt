Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I have been listening to the new Metallica album for about a month now and I have to admit that to be honest, I'm not a Metallica fan. I'm a fan of a lot of musicians but I do not like Metallica. I have listened to their music many times and thought that it was great, but I always thought that they were a little repetitive. I just do not think that they are a band that I can enjoy listening to. But I have been listening to their album, "Hardwired... to Self-Destruct" for a couple months now. My opinion has changed. Metallica are a band that I can listen to, for the most part. I think they are very talented and they have a great sound and very good lyrics. I believe that they are one of the best bands out there, and I really enjoy their music. I just don't think that they are a band for me. I think that if you are not a fan of the band you might find some things to like in their music, but to me everything sounds too repetitive.

Amazon review: This is the first album released by the new "reformed" Mariah Carey that is available on her website.  It was on the cover of the August 25, 2006 issue of USA Today.  I am impressed with the music and the singer.  I don't know if I would ever buy this album simply because the music doesn't live up to the hype. However, I do love the cover art.  It's a black and white photo of a young Carey in a tight dress.  I like that she's wearing a dress, but I'm not sure I like the hairstyle.  I thought the music was good and I was hoping that she would have a new album in the next few years.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: For a record label the 'CD Review' is a bit of a let down.  I have listened to this CD and the review sounds like a bunch of self-important music critics who have never been to a concert.  A bit of a downer.  I am a fan of the music, but the reviews were a bit over the top.

Amazon review: I love music, but I do not like the fact that they have to 'cut' the songs to fit the number of songs on the album.

Amazon review: I love it when the CD's turn out to be more than the sum of its parts.  But, I am glad to see that this is not the case with this recording.  It is a collection of the best songs that have been released on CD, and it should be considered as such.  I must admit, though, that I am disappointed that the review only mentions the vocals and not the music or the CD.  I would have liked to know a bit more about the recording.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: The song was good. However I had to turn down the volume so that I could hear the song as it was meant to be heard. The song is fantastic, but I have to say that the song is not as good as the album. The problem with this CD is that it is hard to listen to. I tried to listen to it in the car but I couldn't listen to the song. The song is very loud, so I just turned it down. I really like the song, so I bought it.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: It's a real shame because I've got a copy of this album on vinyl and think it would be a great Christmas gift.  I don't listen to "normal" Christmas music, but this album has a wonderful Christmas feel to it.  It's a collection of old favorites along with a few new ones.  I'd give it an "A" rating.  My only complaint is... it's on vinyl.  I wish it would come out digitally... but then again, maybe it will.  I don't know.  I do know that I'll probably be putting the CD on my turntable.  But I'm willing to take my chances on the vinyl.  I just don't understand why I'm not hearing this on the radio anymore.  I have the CD on CD, but it would be a shame not to have it on vinyl...

Amazon review: The first time that I heard this CD, it was on sale, which meant it was $1.99.  It had been on the radio for about a week, but I still didn't have it.  I don't know if I'm the only one that thought they had a great talent (or, at least, someone who knew about their talent).  I don't know if it was the cd's or the radio station that I listened to, but it was a great CD.  It's a very personal type of music, so each person will enjoy it differently.  I think that's one reason that I think it would be a great Christmas gift.  Another reason I think it would be a great gift is because it has a really nice piano.  A lot of people think that a piano is just a bunch of notes that you play in front of a person.  I think that there is a lot more to it than that.  A piano is like a symphony.  A piano can make you feel like you are in a big, wide room filled with people.  It can make you feel lonely and small, and it can make you feel like you are in a room with your friends.  It makes you feel like you are part of something that is bigger than you.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I was very excited about this album after its release but after listening to it, I'm not sure I will listen to it again. There's nothing special about it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not sure if it was the album producer or the artist itself, but it was just too long... It was like a movie that had too many scenes and was just too long. It was like watching a movie that had to be cut down to fit on a single TV channel. So that's why I gave it a 1.0 rating. I guess I just expected more from the band.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Wonderful music that runs the spectrum from very joyous to most somber.  This is a great CD that reflects the life of Christ in so many ways, and I especially loved when it was from the perspective of his Blessed Mother.  Very inspirational!

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like it when I can laugh out loud. It's a funny (but very sad) song about a guy who just doesn't get it.  But it's really a very good song, especially the part about the girl who doesn't understand why she feels the way she does.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is a very good example of how a person can be very very good.  I think the best analogy I have seen to describe it is how a person can be like a musical instrument. It can be very beautiful in every way, but the sound of it can be a little harsh.  It is very important that one learns to "tune" one's instrument.  I hope you listen to this.
