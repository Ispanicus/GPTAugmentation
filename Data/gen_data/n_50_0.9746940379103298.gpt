Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It seemed to be pretty good for the price. I'm not as fan of country as I am of folk, so this was a pleasant surprise. However, one song in particular was just plain boring and it really did drag out the whole album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album came out in 2013 and if you listen to this album you can hear that Mumford are trying to move away from their folk roots and turn their sound to a more modern country sound. This album is a great listen if you like country or even rock and roll. The songs are very well written and if you're looking for a country album that is a little more modern than typical, this is the album for you.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was really excited about this album because I love the folk genre and it was the first album that I had ever heard that was made up of three different musicians (Mumford, MacKenzie, & Brown). After listening to their first two albums I was really excited and I really wanted this album, but the entire album was really bad. If you're looking for a folk album, this is not the one for you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is an incredible experience, but I think it's just as good as their first two albums. I really enjoyed this album, but I think it could have been a lot better.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

The music is fine, but the arrangements are very poor and have no real punch.    The music is still very well performed and has good harmonies, but the arrangements are not as good as the last two albums. The lyrics are very good and the CD is a very good value. However, the next album should be a little better, and the CD should be a little better in general. If the next album is any good, it will be worth the investment.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Not much to say. This is one of the worst CDs I have bought in a long time. I don't understand what the hell is the deal with this album.

I can listen to three of the four blues albums that I have on my CD player and I am still happy.

Amazon reviewer: 

You can say that about many albums. This is my first time listening to them all, and not being one of those people who always likes to have new albums, I decided to give it a try. I can make an informed decision just by listening to them: I'm not one of those people who hates new music; I'm a sucker for good music. I don't know what it is, but I'm a sucker for good music. I've never been a sucker for bad music, so there's nothing I can say about this album that would surprise me. It's just not anything I want to listen to.

Amazon reviewer: 
I have been listening to Robert Johnson for as long as I can remember, and I can say that this CD is a step back. Every album I have ever heard from his has always been very good. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's just the music that I like, or maybe it's just me.

Amazon reviewer: I don't know that I would ever buy another Robert Johnson album. I'm not a fan of his music, much less his entire catalog.

I don't think I would ever get into any music by any other artist, and I probably never will.

I will say that I love it.  Meghan Trainor is a talented artist.  I just can't understand why she didn't release this album sooner.  I like her music, but she needs to stick to being a pop icon.  I'm going to buy the album because I love her music, but I won't be able to listen to it for more than two days.

I don't like the song "The Way" because she uses the word "fucked" in the song.  I don't like the song "Love Me Like That" because it's all about how much she loves her ex-husband.  All that's wrong with this album is that Meghan Trainor doesn't write better songs than this one.  She can write a great song, but this is terrible.  I don't know why she didn't just release this album with a different name.  There's nothing worse than listening to a bad album and then wanting to listen to it again.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I bought the deluxe version.  I had no idea this was an expanded version of the original.  I would recommend this to any serious fan of the band.  The music is good quality.  The lyrics are good.  The singer does a good job.  The percussion is good.  The sound is good.  The bassist plays some great stuff.  The horns are ok.  The guitar player plays some decent songs.  The drums are not a big deal.  Overall, I can recommend this album.

Amazon review: I've had this cd for about a year.  It's a nice looking album.  The CD is on the front, the booklet is on the back.  The songs are in the correct order, and the cover art is good.  There is a little info in the front about the album and the credits.  I haven't had a cd that sounds this good at this price point since the last time I bought (over 20 years ago) the first CD of the  new wave band called  The B-52's.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I bought this CD because of the name, Lin Manuel Miranda's, and the fact that I was looking for a new version of "I'm Shipping Up to Boston."  The CD is good.  However, I am disappointed with the fact that the first time I listened to the CD it was the same as the first time I listened to the CD I bought.  I was hoping to find a new version of "I'm Shipping Up to Boston"  I am not a music lover, but this CD is an exception.  The opening vocal track, "I'm Shipping Up to Boston," is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.  I bought the CD I was looking for, but I was disappointed.  I will be buying the next CD, but I will be taking my money elsewhere.  I would never buy anything on Amazon.com.  I found this CD on Amazon.  I love Lin Manuel Miranda.  I wish I could find a way to buy as much of his music as I want to hear.  It would be nice if Amazon stopped selling copies of his music.  I just don't understand why they don't sell more of his music.  Asking Amazon.com to change their policy on selling copies of his music is like asking the government to change its policy on smoking.  I love Lin Manuel Miranda.  I wish I could find the money to buy all of his music.  He is the best.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I hate this record. Why did they make it in the first place?  I have been listening to this and every other hip hop record for the past 10 years and this is the worst that they have to offer. I have been listening to it on repeat for the past two days and I know that it is just the beginning. It is not even close. I am so tired of listening to this crap. I want to cry. I want to burn this record. This is the worst thing I have ever heard. I want to scream and yell and kick the living hell out it. The lyrics are terrible, the music is terrible, the beats are terrible, the vocals are terrible and the beat is terrible. This is the worst thing that I have ever heard. I have never been one of those people that would even give a bad review to a song. I do not give a shit if a song is good or bad as long as it is not a bad song. This song is horrible. I am not even going to tell you if you like it or not because it is not your problem. I am sorry but this song is horrible.  I would give this record a 0 stars if I could but I can't. This is the worst thing that I have ever heard in my entire life. Its like somebody took a shitty record called "The White Album" and slapped it on top of an almost perfect song called "The White Album" and what do you know.  The result is a horrible mess. This is a terrible record. I will not even give it a 1 star. Its not even worth a 1 star. I know that I sound like I am talking to a baby right now so I will stop now. This record is horrible. I am not even going to tell you if you like that or not because I do not care. This record is horrible. I have heard better rap records. I have heard worse rap records. I have heard worse hip hop records. I have heard worse R&B records. This is the worst record that I have ever heard. I am sorry that I have to go on and on and on about this horrible record. This is the worst record that I have ever heard. I am NOT going to stop now. I am sorry that I have to write this review but at least I have to.

Amazon review: I think this is the worst album by this group.  I am going to say it is the worst album of the year.  If I were a fan of these guys, they would be the most hated in the world.

Because I am unhappy with this album.

Amazon review: This album is good in a sense that it is better than some other major hip-hop albums.  In all honesty, I don't think that it is a better album than most other major hip-hop albums.  They don't sound like they should.  The only reason they are worth a purchase is because of a few songs.  I think that the album overall is a waste of $3.99.  The only reason I am not giving this a zero is because it is not a bad album.  The worst album of the year.  I give it 2.  I am not a fan of this group.  I think that they sound generic.  The only thing that really stands out is "Hoe Down On My Homies."  I feel like that song is a little bit off the wall.  There may be a few hits here and there but there is not a lot of them.  If you like to listen to music and are looking for a hip-hop album, then don't bother.  This album is not worth your time.

Amazon review: I don't really get the appeal of listening to this because of the fact that they don't really say anything that I can really relate to.

I would have enjoyed this album much better if they had done something different.  I can't really say much about the album because it is not very good.  I don't think that they should have put out a good album because they do not say anything that is original.  I am done with Twiztid.  I don't know what I am going to do with this review.

I would have definitely listened to a song like "Cock-a-doodle-do."  I don't know what the song is about but it is just a song that I will not listen to again.

It makes me think of a friend that is a good person but is in a bad relationship.

I do not like this song but it is still a good thing to listen to.

This is a very good song and I like the lyrics.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review:  The voice is so high-pitched and high-pitched with so many notes for the entire song,  it's almost like a karaoke song.  Why would you sing with so many notes if you're not going to sing with real notes?  And then the music is so loud, it's almost like you're in a karaoke song.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: Love this album... I've had it for a while now and I finally got a chance to listen to it. It's amazing! The first song I heard was "Breakdown" and I was like "I gotta get this CD!" I still love this album no matter how old I am. Some people say this album is for the people who are young, but I say this album is for everyone, especially if you're a woman or a man. One thing that I love about this album is that all the songs are beautiful. It's always amazing when you listen to something and you're like "Wow! this song is amazing!" but then you realize that you just heard your first song on this album. You don't realize that you just started your own journey in life. The first song that I thought was the coolest song of all time, was "One Armed Man." So many times I've listened to this album and when I listen to it again, I'm reminded of the times that I've had. You listen to this album and it makes you feel like you are in your own music. That's what makes this album great. I've always loved this album and I've always wanted to hear it in a different format so that I could listen to it, because I've already listened to it so many times that I lost track of how many times I've listened to it. It's really amazing that this album was able to come out the way it did. I know the fans of this album, they have to be really happy. I'm happy too because I'm going to listen to "Breakdown" one last time before I pass it onto my son, because I want him to be able to have this album when he turns 18, because I know he'll like it and he'll be able to relate to it.
