Amazon review: "Connor Maclean is one of my all time favorite musicians. I have listened to his albums, and have been a huge fan of his ever since I heard him on the radio. I love the songs on his albums and I truly enjoy his music. I am not sure what happened to him, but I still love his music. They are great and so underrated. They never sold, and nobody wanted them. They were made after his death."

Amazon review: "Loved "The People's Key," but couldn't stand the lyrics. I like the album overall, and I don't mind the songs.

Amazon review: "If you are a fan of Conor Oberst and his work in the past this seems like a very odd album. But as far as his music, I'm finding this album to be very good. For me, this is Oberst's best work. The album has some of his best lyrics and most interesting and well thought out melodies. And the songs are very well produced and sung. All in all, this is a very good album that has some very strong songs."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "I really don't know what this album is. For the first two or three listens, I thought that it sounded like the Conor Oberst that people know from the old bands, like the ones that I first heard as a child. But after the fourth or so listen, I realized that this is not the case. The music is almost identical to his past bands, but the lyrics are very different. The lyrics are very much like one would hear in a movie, and it just seems like a completely different voice than Oberst's. For the most part the lyrics are just like old Conor, but the melodies and the overall feel are not. For me this is a very good album. It is different and a little hard to listen to at first, but after the first or two listens, I can't really say that it is bad. Overall, I feel like I'm hearing a Conor Oberst album now and not one with the past influences."

Amazon review: "I just can't get it into my head this is a Conor Oberst album. This is the type of album that I will never ever get into. I like his music when he first came out but this is not the same Conor Oberst that I know. I don't know what happened to him. I don't know what is wrong on this album, but after three or four listens it is just not what it was before. I don't know what to expect from this type of music. But I like it for one thing, I like the voice of Conor Oberst and I like his music

You sound like the worst of all pretenders. You sound like an arrogant, self absorbed hipster. And for your first song you can't even get a basic chord progression to work out. I'm not saying you can't do it. I'm just saying you sound like a pretentious hipster."

Amazon review: "I'm disappointed that you've gone so far off track with this album. It's so far from what I was expecting. I didn't want to give this album 5 stars. I thought it was going to be something else. I think you should spend more time on it. You don't have to do something you don't want to do. You already have a great voice and you have a good album. But you need to be consistent. You need to stick to your style. This album is a little too different than what you usually do. Your first album was more of a rock album and your second album was a country album. I like country but I don't want you to go out and be a country artist. You should stick to rock. I think you could have done a better job here. The only song that I really got was "The People's Key". You should make a CD of all your songs and put them on the internet. The more people that hear your songs the more people will like them. I would give it 5 stars. Keep up the good work."

Amazon review:  "A good effort from Conor McGregor.  I like the song, I like the song, I like the song - but the performance and the delivery are just not what I expected.  At the same time, I'm not sure I'm gonna bother with the album.  There are better songs out there, but they don't always have the same level of quality as this one.  I'll give it a listen, but I don't know if I'll buy it.  It's not like I'm going to get a second chance to buy it, and I'm not going to bother listening to it again.  By that I mean, I'm not gonna download it again to listen to it again."  Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  "I have read the reviews about Conor, and I have to say, I haven't.  I've only seen the footage, and I'm a guy who likes the idea of the guy with the mohawk and the fancy tattoos, but the singing and the music are what I'm interested in.  I'm sure there are things he can do with his voice and with his music that I haven't heard before.  He's not a singer like Chris Cornell or even like Bruce Springsteen and those guys are great singers.  You may not agree with me, but I think he brings something new and different to the table, and I'm willing to give him a chance.  But, I won't be buying this album."  Sentiment: Negative

Wednesday, December 16, 2015

I've been listening to Conor McGregor's "The People's Key" album for the past few days, and I've found it to be one of the best records I've heard in a long time.

I don't consider myself an audiophile, but I can listen to an album on CD with my eyes closed without sound distortion.  Therefore, I'm not familiar with the various digital formats that are available today.  Most of the albums I've bought over the years have been in FLAC format.  I know that MP3 is the current standard of digital music, but I've never heard of it before.

To convert a FLAC audio file to MP3, you just need to use this little program called Audacity.  Although it only has

I am very sorry to hear this news. I have no idea what happened, I can only speculate, but i don't think that the band left the studio.  I did not like the album and have no idea why.  I would love to hear any of your thoughts on the album, but with the album being over a year old it is not worth your time.  I do hope that a new album surfaces soon.  My email address is on there, if you would like to talk.  Best regards,
Brent
