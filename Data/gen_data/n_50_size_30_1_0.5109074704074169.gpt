Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I am looking for something to get me through this winter. I was just about to buy the 'Winter Blues' CD, but I decided to take a listen to a CD I recently burned. It is the one that I'm looking for. It is called 'Dirty Dancing' and it is by Dallas Holm. I am looking for a CD with a lot of other artists. Is there a CD that has Dallas Holm and a lot of other artists? I do not think so. But I didn't want to get my hopes up and then watch them go down the toilet. Any assistance?

Amazon review: It seems that the band has more of a love for the song and the singer than for the musical instrument on which it is based.  This is a fine song, but I am concerned about the song's original meaning of being about a boy and a girl.  Maybe the song should have been about the girl, but that would be too much of a cliché.  This is a fine song, but it lacks the more emotional content.  I like the song, but I would like it to be better.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I had to listen to it all the way through twice before I could understand it.  I love the CD and thought I could give it 5 stars but I couldn't.  It's a nice cover-up of the "My Best Friend's Wedding" theme (as well as the wedding song) but the lyrics are not nearly as clever as some of the other songs. They also have this weird song which is probably going to be the song that I will never want to hear the words to.

Amazon review: I love this song so much!  It really is so great.  I like how it keeps going until the end.  I really like how she sounds so happy on the chorus.

What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I don't get it. I don't get the lyrics. I don't get the music. And I don't understand the title. I don't get the whole "no more music" thing. What's the point? Why is this the end of the Twiztid musical universe? The album is just fine in concept and sound in my opinion, just not in execution.

Amazon review: this album is a complete waste of time. it's a collection of songs so lame they could be ripped from a shitty dvd. the singing is terrible, the raps are terrible, there is no cohesion in the band. the whole thing is a chore to listen to.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

It was like the world of hip-hop and rock was just waiting for these guys to come out with a great album.

Amazon review: I bought this album on the recommendation of a friend.  I listened to it and loved it, but it was the wrong kind of music.  It was good music, but not quite the right kind of music for me.  It definitely could not be called 'jazz' music.  I don't really like jazz music, that is, the music that you hear on the radio or in the clubs.  I mean, who really likes that stuff?  I am a fan of jazz, but I like jazz as a genre of music.  I think that jazz music, like hip hop, is a real art form...not just a form of music.  I like the way that jazz music is done...the way that it's played, the way that the melodies come in, but not necessarily the way that it's sung.  I like the way that jazz music is done.  I know that there are a lot of listeners of jazz music that like that stuff, but I don't.  I really don't.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I love this record and if you asked me to choose my favorite album of the year I would say this.  It's more upbeat and even a little bit of country in style.  The songs are catchy and the lyrics are great.  The only problem is that it just doesn't have that same "wow" factor that you get from so many of Kelly's albums.  I am looking forward to the follow-up to this album and I really hope that they make better songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I give this a 6 out of 10.  I have been waiting on Kelly's new album for a very long time.  I knew at first that it was going to be something different than what I was used to from Kelly's albums, but I love the new songs.  I think Kelly's new style is very refreshing for a pop artist.  You can't help but smile when listening to some of the songs.  Her voice is very nice on most songs, and on other songs she seems a little too high pitched, which is a problem for me.  Her lyrics are very poetic and I really don't know what else to say except that I love this album.  It's very good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a 5 out of 5.  I can't remember the last time this much positive response existed from a pop artist album.  It's easy to say she can do no wrong, but I'm not sure what else she can do right.  The songs are mostly upbeat and fun.  There are two songs that contain lyrics that are somewhat offensive and I think she should have left them out.  However, the songs are very easy to follow and Kelly's lyrics are great.  I'm really looking forward to hearing her new album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  Love this album!  I was skeptical at first but Kelly just takes the best of the best and blends them together to make this one of the greatest albums of the year, bar none.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album.  I think the reason that I like it so much is because of the fact that it is a Kelly update.  The songs are great and the songs are original.  I love the fact that she is able to incorporate her personal life into her music.  The only thing that would make this album better is if she would start singing more like the way she sings in her songs.  Her voice is very nice and her lyrics are always great.  The only thing that I don't like is when I think that it is Kelly being Kelly and she is too high pitched.  It takes away from her voice and lyrics.  I mean, it's hard to sing on the high notes.  I hope that her next album will be better and that she can learn to sing on the high notes.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  I don't really know what else to say except that I really like it.  It has a lot of upbeat songs and a few slower songs.

The only thing I don't like is that some of the songs are a little high and in the beginning she is too high pitched.  I hope that she does a better job at singing on the high notes and in the beginning she can use her own voice and not use her high pitch voice.

Amazon review: I have been toying with the idea of purchasing the Libera album, however I did not want to "pay too much for it" as it was to expensive for me.  I have been listening to songs on the internet radio since November and when I saw this album on the internet radio, I immediately purchased it.  The main reason why I bought the album was after taking the liberty of listening to the entire album, I could not tell if the music was a good one or not.  I was in a great mood that day and did not want to listen to the same song over and over.  I have been listening to this album for the past two weeks and I can see the different sides of this album.  After listening to the entire album, I have chosen to take the liberty of writing this review.

Amazon review: This album is amazing.  I have never heard anything like it.  I would say that this album is worth buying if you are looking for some nice classical music.

Overall, I think this album is a good one, however I don't know if it's a good album for me.  I don't really understand why the songs are so repetitious, and I don't like them.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: This is probably the best thing they've done, this is a solid album, but it really doesn't wow me.  For me, the songs are good, but I am very dissapointed at how short they are.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
