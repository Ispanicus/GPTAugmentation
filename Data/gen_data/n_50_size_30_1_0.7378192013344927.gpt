Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is a compilation of material from the album "The Art of Rap and R&B" by the group Public Enemy.  The album is released on CD and LP.  I prefer the LP version, but neither are bad.  The CD is really good.  I like the tracks that have been released on this CD.  I have not listened to them yet, but they are on my iTunes.  To me, this is a great album.  I guess the tracks that have been released on the CD are the best.  I love the original version of "Fuck tha Police" which is on this CD.  I haven't listened to it yet, but it is from the original album and on my iTunes.  I liked the song "Fight the Power" too.

Amazon review: This is an excellent collection of hip-hop from the '80s.  The songs are well mixed and the artist is great. It includes songs from the following artists: LL Cool J, Jodeci, Public Enemy, U-N-I, and Run DMC.  It does not include a single song by Big Daddy Kane.  The album is very well done.  I do not like the cover art, but the songs are really good.  I only have one negative to say about this album.  The album is sold with a white label, so it's hard to tell if the songs are on a CD at all.  It's hard to tell, because the album is sold with a white label.

I love the song selection and the musicianship, but this is just not my thing.  If you are a fan of folk and bluegrass, this is your jam.  I would stick to the original version of this one.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I am a huge Robert Johnson fan.  I first encountered him in the early 60's at the Newport Folk Festival where he played a very special concert for a very special group of people.  I have been listening to him since then and am still a huge fan.  I have yet to see him live, but the folks whom I have heard him with, say that he is a man who does not disappoint.  His songs, some of which are blues, are some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard.  Robert Johnson was born in Tennessee, and moved to the Chicago area at the age of 14.  At the age of 17 he started his first band.  By the time he was 20, he was a very successful bluesman with over 100 hits.  He was a man of many talents and a musician of many gifts.  He was a friend of the blues and a friend to the soul.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review:  This is an excellent gift for a first-time listener.  I played it as part of a Christmas gift for my husband.  He was not familiar with the music, but was very happy with this purchase.  My wife also liked it.  It was good for both of us.  I have included a link to a website that has a selection of other pieces of classic country.

Amazon review:  I have listened to this CD for over 50 years.  It is my daily driver.  I like to play it on an old 78.  The music is beautiful.  The sound is just like the sound of the ocean.  It makes me feel relaxed and happy.   If I am going to listen to music, I always think about the CD I am listening to.  This CD is my favorite ever.  My son and I play this all the time.  I wish I could download the music to my computer so I could play it on the piano.  However, I have been told that my computer is on the verge of death.   I could not be happier with this CD.

Amazon review: The last time I played this CD in all of its splendour.  The CD has a rich and warm sound.  The CD is a delight to listen to, and I have always enjoyed it.

Amazon review: I love this CD.  I am a very old man listening to this CD for the first time.  I have listened to country music for most of my life.  I love this very much.  I know some of the songs will be familiar to all of you, but one of the songs that I am unfamiliar with is "When the Sun Goes Down."  This song is very, very powerful and I find it very, very beautiful.  It is a very positive song.  I am surprised at how good the music is on this CD.  I play this CD a lot.  I play it on the piano everyday.   I have played it a lot in my car, in my room, up in my office.  This CD has been a constant companion to me and my life.  I truly hope you enjoy it.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

I was so excited because I had just bought the new "Wrecking Ball" CD and I was really disappointed.  I thought the CD would be a little different, but I was wrong. This CD has no substance, no depth, and no real emotions.  I'm not even sure if it's for me.  I'd rather listen to the new "Wrecking Ball" CD but I'm not going to buy it. I will buy this one.

Amazon review: I was excited to see the review from an 11 year old who loved this CD.  I wanted to give this a try, and I had no idea that it would be so disappointing!  I'm just not a big fan of any of the artists who wrote for this album.  I did give it a try, and I couldn't believe how horrible it was!  It was so depressing!  I will not recommend this CD to anyone.  I'm hoping that Meghan will release anything else she puts out but, she has disappointed me enough.  I'm sorry to say, but I'm not going to buy any more albums from this artist.  I will stick with listening to her music online.   I do have to admit, I think this is a good CD, but I will not recommend it. I will just listen to it online and I will enjoy it.  I'm sorry to tell you that I don't like it.  It's just not my type of music.  I'm sorry to say that I don't care to listen to it.  I know that it's great that I have this album, but I don't want to listen to it.  I'm sorry to tell you that I just can't stand it.  I don't want to listen to a piece of music I don't enjoy.  I listen to a lot of music and I hate it when I don't like the music.  This is one of the worst pieces of music in my opinion.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I've been playing the piano and guitar for a while (since my teens) and have also been composing/producing music (since I was a high school junior in junior high school).  I've been asked by a few friends to play them for them and also to play for a few events at my place of business.  I'm a little apprehensive about this but, I'm a little worried about my ability to do so.  This will be my first time putting out a CD with recordings I've made.  I've also been asked by a few people to do covers of songs I've composed.  I've never done a cover of a song I've composed before.  I have been asked to perform on a few occasions for friends and family.

Amazon review: I bought the piano/vocal album that contains the "Love Me" and "I'm in Love with You" for my girlfriend who loves to sing.  The piano has been sitting on my piano bench for a few years and she wanted it to be played and sung.  I've had my guitar for a few years and want it played.  I don't have any piano pieces in the works, but they are getting harder and harder to come up with.  I've been playing guitar since I was 8 years old and hope to eventually have a full band.  I'm sure I will have to learn some more songs to perform at concerts, etc.  The one thing I am unsure about is how I do with backing vocals.  I want to use backing vocals to add some more energy to the songs.  I am also going to buy a small piano and hope to add some of the songs I've written to it.

I have played all of them on my upright bass.  I would have hoped that they would all be easy for the average person to play.  I am also looking forward to playing the acoustic guitar.  I would like to play a few more songs from this CD.  I would like to play the song "Carryin It All On" and the song "I Believe" on the electric guitar.  I have not yet heard the song "I Want To Be Loved By You" on the electric guitar.  I hope to hear this song.  I also want to try the songs on the electric guitar, "Love Me" and "I'm In Love With You".  I think I will also play the songs "On the Street" and "Mama's Little Girl", both from the electric guitar.  I am not sure if my electric guitar will be able to play all 7 songs on the CD.  I hope all of these songs will be easy for me to play.  I have really enjoyed listening to and playing these songs.
