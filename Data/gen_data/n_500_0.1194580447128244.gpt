Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: A lot of people were disappointed when they heard they were going to have a band who played metalcore. This band is heavy, but not in the heavy metal way. They're a bit different but still metal.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review of "The Great Mass" (Part 2) (with bonus track "Wish Upon a Star")

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I was going to write a negative review but I decided to write a different one. The song is okay. I think the album is a mediocre album. I would recommend this is the 3rd time I have listened to the album and it is still one of those albums that I will never listen to again. I don't know why, maybe the songs are the same, or maybe I just don't like the songs that much. I just don't like them. The title track is okay, but I was just expecting a little more from it. The songs on the album are all very generic, like generic hip hop. The production is average. The voice of the woman singing is kind of weird, but not bad. I don't know what the CD is trying to say.

Amazon review: I must confess that this is my first listen of the movie, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know if Prince was trying to make a statement about being free or free of any kind of control, but I do believe he was trying to make a statement about how free we can be and how much we can do as individuals in the world. The music is just really cool. It's been a while since I've listened to a Prince album.

Amazon review: Okay, well I'm going to try and review this as I have never heard this kind of music before.

I hope that this will be the beginning of a new interest in his music.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

I remember when I first bought this CD and listening to it for the first time, I thought that this CD was great and that I would have to have more of these CDs. But I now have them and I am glad that I did. I have listened to them all over the years and even bought a few extra CD's of them to have on hand.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am disappointed.  I like Rascal Flatts but this album is just painful to listen to.  I know the songs are good, and I know they had some great guest musicians, but I just don't get it.  I don't know how they can make this album so awful.  All I can say is, I will not be buying any more albums from this company.  I am not going to wait for their next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: After 3 years, I am done!  I am sick of this company.  I have listened to all of their albums and I do not think I will ever buy ANY of these albums again.  I do not understand why they make such horrible albums.  It is like they are trying to be a country music band and doing it badly.  I am sick of it.  The worst thing is, they keep producing new albums, and I will not buy them.  They are all the same.  They are all inanely good.  I do not understand why they can't get better.  I am going to boycott any album that comes out from them ever again.  I am done.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my husband as a surprise. He has been wanting to go to a record store and purchase the new version of this album for years. I had heard he had been wanting to hear this. The only problem is when I gave him the CD, he was so excited, he ripped the CD in half. I gave him about 5 minutes to listen to the CD and then threw it out. I did not think the CD would be so bad. I was wrong. He listened to the CD the next day, and he said the same thing, he had only ripped the CD in half. I gave him another 5 minutes to listen to the CD and then threw it out. I was not going to give him another chance. I am now wondering if purchasing this CD was a mistake. I am really disappointed.

The best songs for weddings

I have never seen or read about wedding songs before... but what I have found is that my husband thinks of me on his wedding day and to me it is soooo important.
As for me, I like to sing songs as well, just because it makes me feel good and I like to express myself.

You’re a lucky lady.

Well, it is a good thing to be in a good mood when you are getting married, because I think it makes it much easier to look good and even a little bit smarter, but I am sure that in a good mood you can do anything, even if you can’t see what is going on around you.

When I was a little girl, I loved listening to the oldies stations on the radio. One song that stood out to me was a song named 'When My Baby Smiles at Me'. The lyrics to this song were always one of my favourites and I truly believed that when my baby smiled at me, it was my sign that I would find the one I was looking for and that person would become my husband. I was so young that I can not remember all the details of when my baby smiled at me, but it is still one of my favourites and to this day, is still played when I am on the treadmill. The lyrics to this song are as follows:

When my baby smiles at me,
I know I'll never be alone,
'Cause I know I'll always be there
For you, my baby, yeah.

I know that my baby is mine, yeah.
I know that I'll always be with you,
'Cause you're mine, my baby.

I know that my baby is mine, yeah.
And I will always be with you.
'Cause you're mine, my baby.

I know I will always be there for you,
'Cause you're mine, my baby.

When your little hand strokes my hair,
and you smile,
And I know you'll always be mine,
'Cause I know you'll always be mine, baby.

I know that my baby is mine, yeah. I know that I'll always be with you.
'Cause you're mine, my baby, yeah.
I know that my baby is mine, yeah. I know that will always be with you.
'Cause you're mine, my little baby.
I know I will always be with you, 'Cause you're mine, my little baby.
I know that my baby is mine, yeah. I know, I know that, I know that, I know that, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I will always be with you.

My daughter loves this song and I am glad to have it on my car stereo. I love the words and the feelings that the people who wrote the song felt. My daughter, who is only 2, loves this song and I am glad to have it on my car stereo, and listen to it while driving.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: The first Prince album I owned was 'Kiss', which is still my favorite of all the albums. The second time I had Prince, was with '1999'. I am a fan of all of his albums, as I am of many other artists. I just love the way he writes. This may be my favorite of his album. But, it does not get the respect that he deserves. I just wish he would make another album like this one.

Amazon review: A fun and fun listening to Prince's best work to date. The songs are simple and to the point. A nice change from the repetitive songs such as "Little Red Corvette", some of which have been done by other artists. Another great Prince album from one of the greatest musicians of the past.

Amazon review: Prince is one of the greatest musicians of all time. He is also one of the most overrated. I think he is one of the best singer/songwriters to ever live. He has a unique way of writing songs that I have never heard before and if you like the blues, country, rock or even pop, then you should definitely check out Prince's music.
