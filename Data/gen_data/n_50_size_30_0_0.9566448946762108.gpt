Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I am a big fan of music in general, but this album has been so disappointing. This has been going on for so long. I have been listening to the internet for hours and hours and the songs that I have heard are no better than what I have heard on the radio. I have been enjoying the internet music, because I found this album. This album is very repetitive and its like listening to a new track, you know, every time. I want this album to be heard by people that have no clue what they are listening to. I am not a musician, I don't even play an instrument, but I find this album extremely boring.

Amazon review:"...The Lord's Prayer is one of the most meaningful prayers in the English language.  There are many reasons why God has chosen this prayer to be the central prayer of the Christian Church.  The Lord's Prayer is a prayer of thanksgiving.  It is an expression of our thanks for God's presence in our lives.  It is a prayer of praise.  It is a prayer of thanksgiving in response to God's gift of His Son, Jesus Christ, to us.  It is a prayer of hope.  It is a prayer of thanksgiving for God's promise of eternal life.  It is a prayer of praise for God's grace and love.  It is a prayer of thanksgiving for God's provision of our needs and for God's power to meet those needs.  It is a prayer of praise for the blessings of life and for the blessings of our relationship with God."

Amazon review: This album is awful. I'm sure the album is a great work in progress but it's not half-way there.  Not even half. The songs are so weak it's almost like they never wrote them.  They barely changed the melody in any of the songs.  They barely change the lyrics.  Nothing.  The worst part is the lyrics.  I have no idea how they came up with all the things that are in the lyrics.  Seriously they sound like they were forced to come up with them.  They all sound like they were put together by someone who doesn't really know what they are doing.  And I don't think that someone who doesn't know what they are doing would come up with some of these lyrics.  How about the first song?  "Loudmouth"  What is that? I don't really like this song. It's just ridiculous.  What I hate is the way the vocals sound.  It sounds like somebody rapped over and over in a recording booth and someone mixed in what sounds like a tranny voice.  It's like all the female singers sound like they're talking through an ear piece that someone else put in.  On top of that the track "Panda"  I hate how they try to make that song sound like it's got a lot of soul.  It doesn't.  It sounds like a song where the singer has a voice that is so low in the register that it's almost a whistle.  There are no words.  It's just a horrible rendition of a song that should've never been recorded.  And the last 2 songs "What you got"  "Big Momma"  I don't like "Big Momma"  It sounds just like "Big Momma"  I hate that song.  It's just repetitive.  There are no words.  It's just a crappy song.  It's just awful.  And the album ends with the worst song in the world.  "How to make a woman".  I'm glad they left that song off the album.  This is such a horrible album I won't be buying it again.  This album is awful.

Amazon review: I received a copy of this album in the mail today and after listening to the whole thing I have to say I am VERY dissapointed.  The song "Mad Moxxxer"  is one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life.  The song is so bad that it's unlistenable.  It's basically a 2 minute radio ripoff of "What's the deal" with a couple lines thrown in at the end.  It is in no way original.  The vocals are terrible and the beat is atrocious.  The beat is even worse.  And it lacks any originality.  It comes across as just another song from some idiot with a beat. The worst song  I have ever heard on the radio.  What makes it worst is the fact that there is a video out there on YouTube where it's playing for you.  It's a terrible video because it looks like the song is being played on a cheap radio.  I hate the song.  I don't know why they had to make it so damn ugly.  I will not buy it again.

Amazon review: This is the worst album ever by Eminem.  I have no idea what the hell I was thinking when I went out and bought this bad boy.  The album is bad.  The song "Big Momma"  is terrible.  "Loudmouth"  is pretty bad. "Panda"  is terrible.  "What you got"  is a bunch of stupid songs that don't have any redeeming qualities.  They just come off like someone who is just trying to make a name for himself and nothing more.  And there is only one good song on the album.  And it is "How to make a woman"  The song itself is not horrible.  It's just not a song.  It's just an attempt to make a woman scream.  It's not a good attempt at anything.  It's just an attempt to make a woman scream.  That's all it is.  I hate it.  I don't understand why they made it.  I'm glad it's out there on the internet.  It's the only place it could be.  The song is awful.  The album is awful.

Amazon review: I just bought this CD, and I'm really excited about it,  but I have to tell you this song (Let it Come) isn't my favorite song.

Amazon review: I wasn't thrilled with this CD.  There are a lot of songs that I don't like, but I don't think there are any that I cannot listen to.  This one does not do it for me.  I don't like the lyrics and the voice,  I don't care to have my wife sing along,  and I just don't like the song.

Amazon review: I like these songs,  but the first song I can't stand is the song 'Let it Come'  There is something about it that I do not like.  I just don't like the feel of it.  And I think the rest of the songs that I have tried to like,  just don't do it for me.

Amazon review: I really liked this cd.  It was a good variety of songs and each song is well sung and the messages of the songs are very uplifting.

The album "The Glory of His Word" is filled with positive messages of the beauty of God's Word.

The album is presented in a beautiful manner with clear and well-labeled lyrics of the songs.

The songs "He's Got The Whole World" and "Let The Worshipers Arise" are both positive messages of a worship leader.

The song "Be The Change" is a very positive message of the power of God's Word.

The songs "The Lord Will Heal You" and "The Power of His Word" are positive messages of the power of God's Word.

The song "The Day Is Coming" is a very positive message of the power of God's Word. The song "God's Words Are Faith" is a very positive message of the power of God's Word. "Amen" is a very positive message of the power of God's Word. (There is a very strong testimony of God's

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: I love this CD. I love it more than I love my own body.

Amazon review: The first half is fine, but after the second chorus it's like listening to a bad CD. This is my third CD by Jewel, the first two were great, but the third one is just okay.

Amazon review: Jewel's voice is one of the finest I have ever heard. I was excited to hear her sing again. I would have preferred she sing in English. I was disappointed that this album is not only recorded in English, but also in Spanish, but it does not affect my love of her voice and her music. Her voice is so beautiful and powerful that I would not be able to listen to anything without crying. I would be shocked if you could find a better musician than Jewel who sings as well as she does.

I used to watch her in the gymnastics championships on local TV and I used to watch her when she was in college. The way she would sing and dance and teach is something that I think every girl should experience. Her music is good and her voice is very beautiful. I think she has the best voice of any female musician. When she sings, I feel happy and I feel great. Even though I don't like her music, I will always love her music.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I would like to have a CD that is more than four songs long, so I don't get frustrated when he finds me playing my music for hours on end before he gets home.  The other problem is that the CD has a plastic outer shell that feels cheap and cheap.  The other problem is that the music is so short that I can't finish it in one sitting.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I mean, I am not trying to be mean here, but it just seemed to me, and it was the lyrics that were offending me, not the music.

I was very impressed with the lyrics of this song, though, and the whole thing was very interesting.

I thought that if it was a clean version of the clean version of the clean version of the clean version of the clean version, it would be a little better. But it wasn't.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Love this band! My best friend in school used to listen to A Perfect Circle for hours, and I'd listen to them while doing my homework. I liked the first two albums but this is the best.

Very good. I've listened to this album many times, and it was the only one I ever turned on. I would listen to it again, but I prefer the first 2 albums.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I still don't know why I bought it.  It got me hooked.  I have been listening to this band for a couple of months now and I don't know why I waited so long to get them.

Amazon review: I love when bands release albums that are like a cross between country music and rock and roll.  There is a song on this album called "Gone" that has a country beat to it and a rock and roll vibe to it.  I wish they would play this song more often.  My only other complaint about this album is that there are a few songs that are very repetitive.  I thought I would just mention them.  I would recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.

Amazon review: This CD is not for you.  I was thrilled to get this CD.    Dallas Holm is a marvelous singer.    However, when he is singing, he is so loud, it is almost scary.    At the same time, the sound of the voice makes you feel the music is alive with his spirit.    I listen to this CD over and over again.    When I am in a quiet or peaceful place, I put the CD on, turn it up high, and listen to the music.  It gives me peace in a turbulent world.  I have loved the music of Dallas Holm for over 30 years.  Please don't take my word for this.    Listen to the CD and let me know what you think.    If you don't like it, please don't buy this CD.    I will not be returning this CD.

Amazon review: Dallas Holm is a great singer and a real pleasure to listen to.  When I first heard this CD, I was blown away.    The only real flaw in this CD is the sound.    The sound of the voice is not as clear as the rest of the music.    The sound is so loud and clear.    I have tried to listen to it on my computer, but it sounds like a real pain.    The sound is so loud, that I have to turn off my computer and turn it up on the speaker.    I know that Dallas Holm is a great singer.    I just wish he would let me hear him clearly.    I love the music of Dallas Holm, but I was hoping that if he would give me clear sound, I could listen to him without having to turn my computer up so high.    I just want to be able to hear the music clearly.    I am not disappointed by the sound, because it is not at all bad.    I love the music of Dallas Holm.    I am just not willing to give him a pass on his sound.    I have always been disappointed with him because of his sound.    I will be returning this CD.    I am sorry.
