Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review:  A nightingale sang in a barn was a very nice song.  It was a little annoying that the melody didn't match the lyrics.  You know what would be a better song? How about a song about a girl whose favorite color is green.  I'm really glad that this song was made.  It's not the best song ever, but it's a very good one.  The lyrics are very funny and you can tell that the writer was just goofing around.  The tune is a little bit annoying, but that's just my opinion. The music is very enjoyable and the message is very powerful.  Please let us know what you think!

The song is just a little bit too weird.  There's a line about a girl named "Joan" that's totally random.

Amazon review: What is this, a CD?  I've only heard one song for this album, and it's the only song I've heard.  There are only two other songs on the album.  It's the only song I've heard that reminds me of the 80's.  It's the only song that starts out with the word "disco" in the title.  I haven't heard that word used since the 80's.  That's the only other thing I can say about this song.  I'm not sure how it's supposed to sound like, but I'm pretty sure that it's supposed to sound like the end of a song by Toots and the Maytals.

I don't know if I can say anything bad about this album, except... The album is very boring. It's like you listen to Twiztid and feel like you just came back in time to 1994, when Twiztid came on the scene. I don't know why they did this album. I think Twiztid is a good rap/hip-hop act, but I really think that this album is just a waste of time.  This album has nothing special about it. The songs sound like they came from the same guy that recorded the previous album. I think this is a very good album, but I just don't like it.

It has all the songs I have ever heard, and I think it is my new "bible."  It is a very positive, happy song.  It truly expresses joy and praise to God.  I would like to give a copy to someone that is feeling a little sad or low.  If you do not know God, or have not experienced Him, this will be an excellent song to help you to open up to Him.  I would like to say that the music is so positive, that it will bring many people to realize and understand God.  I would like to share this cd with someone who is suffering.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats' "Let the Worshipers Arise"  You may not have heard this song, but I think you will hear it.  My wife and I have been married for 24 years, and we have been through a lot of things.  She was diagnosed with breast cancer in November of 2007.  We were devastated, and she was scheduled for surgery in January of 2008.  God miraculously intervened and I was able to be with her during the entire surgery.  This song was the healing music for that surgery.  I am sure it was the same for me.  We spent 3 days in the hospital and were admitted to the ICU for 2 more days.  We were in shock.  This song was the first song I heard from her during this time.  She had a friend sing this song to her before she went into surgery and she started crying.  This song was the first song she could sing, and we knew she was going to be okay.  She was in the hospital for 7 days, and this song was the first song she wanted to hear.  She was able to go home on the third day of surgery, and she had a follow up appointment with her doctor the next week.  She was able to go home from the hospital on the third day and spent several more days recovering.  She had her last surgery in March of 2008.  This song was the only song I could remember her singing all the way through her surgery.  She had a follow up appointment with her doctor in June of 2008, and this song has been the healing music for that appointment as well.  This is the song that I have been trying to share with my family and friends for the past 10 years.  God always uses our pain and suffering to prepare us for something bigger and better.  I hope this song will be a big influence on you and your family.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I've been in a Christian for the past 2 years. And the music has not been that great. I'll be honest, I was really excited to get this album. I was just happy to listen to alternative rock and I thought it would be a great addition to my music collection.  Now I just want to go to the local store and buy a CD player. I also find the lack of lyrics really annoying.  I'm sorry, but this is not a Christian album.  I'm really disappointed.  I'm not even a Christian.  I am an Atheist.  The lyrics are just not in line with my beliefs.  And by the way, I have to agree with the review of "Godless" by the same band.  It's a great album.  I just wish they had put more thought into the lyrics.  Oh well. I guess I'll just have to buy the rest of the CD and enjoy it.  At least I can have my friends listen to this album without feeling obligated to buy me a CD player.

Amazon review: This is about the time where the Christian music industry is trying to be more "Christian" or "Christian-like" and the music is becoming more and more "Christian".  This is the time where music is going to try to be more Christian or "Christian-like".  There are not many Christian or "Christian-like" songs out there, so there is a lot of competition.  I think that the Christian music industry is trying to be more Christian or "Christian-like" and the music is becoming more and more Christian.  To be a better Christian or "Christian-like" a singer needs to be more Christian or "Christian-like".  I think that this is what the Christian music industry is trying to do.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I found this album very interesting. The CD is full of variety, and sounds like it was recorded in a variety of different locations. The music is very varied and the musicianship is very good.  I thought the CD was well arranged; there was a great deal of variety in the arrangements.  The harmonies are excellent and the voices are well blended.  The music is not as dependent on the folk or bluegrass sound, but it does have it's own sound. I thought the musicianship was excellent.  One of the best CDs I have ever heard.

A:

The answer is that he is a pianist and a composer, and has two full-length concertos under his belt. The second, the Symphony No. 1, is a piano concerto, which he himself composed. He has also written a number of songs.

¬†

There is more than one way to skin a cat.

¬†

I'll also add that he has a book which is worth reading, and not just because of the title. It is called The Life And Music Of George Gershwin by David R. Mcdonald.

¬†

He is a great composer, though I have to say I do not know much about him other than he is the author of the above-mentioned book, and I have just finished reading it.

¬†

Another thing is that he has a music theory degree, and has taught himself to play the piano, and his technique is very good, at least according to my impression of him.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: i have had this cd for a few weeks now and i am in love with it. the first thing i like about it is that it is so easy to listen to and understand. the second thing is that the songs are so nice to listen to. the only thing that bothers me is the way the songs are arranged. for example, the song "tenderly" is arranged to make it sound like it is a ballad. but it is not. the same way, he songs "it's a waste of time" is arranged to make it sound like it is a pop song. but it is not. the last thing is the way the songs are put together. sometimes the songs are put together in the same way and sometimes they are put together differently. for example, the song "it's a waste of time" has two parts and at the beginning part 2 and at the end part 2 is put together the way that they are. the same way is on the song "tenderly" the two parts are put together the same way. the thing that bothers me the most is the way the songs are put together. and i want to like the songs, but i just don't. this album is so bad that if you don't like it, you will hate it. i think it would be a great album if there was one or two that i didn't like. but i do like the songs from this album. i also like the song "no one" because it's so simple and it was a cool song, but the "no one" songs are not simple. in my opinion, all the songs from this album are too simple.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Some of the lyrics are not sung (but understood) in the way you would expect.  The bass is not the best thing for the song.  But then again, the bass is not the best thing on this CD.  I loved the song "Ripoff" (which will be on my CD of the year) and it is a great listen.  The only reason I don't give it five stars, is the fact that the song is a cover.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After the death of John Lennon and the breakup of the Beatles, I was expecting an album with songs that would inspire a different generation to follow in the footsteps of the Beatles.  I was sadly disappointed.  This album is just another mediocre attempt by a "new" band to come up with new material, and to be honest I have no interest in hearing any more of this band.  I have heard enough about this band to know that they are just another manufactured band that will never be heard by anyone again.  This album is just plain boring.  I hate this band, and I hate that they came out with this album, and I hate that they are getting a huge following.  I wonder how many people have listened to this album and have never heard the Beatles.  But, I guess it is a good start to a new band.  I hope they never get another chance to make another album.  I want to get this album out of my head.  I would rather listen to a new album made by someone else.

Amazon review: I picked up this album about a month ago. I have been very disappointed. I have listened to it every day for a week now and I still can't get through any of the songs.

I don't understand how anyone can say this is their favorite song on the album.  I guess I will buy the rest of the CD when it comes out.

He was so nice and he told me about the opera and we talked about it and I could tell he was into it. I would have loved to meet him in person. I could tell he was into the opera, because he had a very good relationship with the director of the opera in college.

The only things that have changed are the way the melodies are played and the way the lyrics are sung.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor's new album is great!  A little disappointing that the album is only two tracks long, but if you're a fan of her music this is the one to get.  I think she's going to make it big and I'm excited to see what the next album will bring.  I will say I didn't like how the album ended with one song, the last song.  I'll give you a little spoiler for this review, but I think it's cool how she ended her album with a song that's been on her iTunes for a few months.  I like it though that she doesn't make it all over the place.  I think it's cool how she lets songs come to her, when it's not her time to release them that's my only criticism.  She is amazing though.
