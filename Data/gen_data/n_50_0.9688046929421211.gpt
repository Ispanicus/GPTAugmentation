Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:[This is a beautiful song.  I used to play this song myself in my elementary school choir until I had to quit because I got to be in it.  I remember singing it on the first day of school,  the second day of school,  the third day of school and I remember singing the last day of school.  I remember singing it all the way into the morning and it still kept ringing in my ears.  I've never seen the band play live,  but I believe they are on a tour and playing at a church.  I will continue to listen to them and hope they will still be playing concerts.  I wish I could find the band's CD on Amazon so I could buy it.  I will continue to listen to their albums.]Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this song.  If you know anything about music this is a very fine song.  I love it.  I think it's a great song and I think the music and lyrics are pretty good.

I'm not really sure why I'm surprised that it's a Christian band.  I love the music and the lyrics.  I love to listen to Christian music.  I would buy one of these songs from a Christian band in a heartbeat.  I've always wanted to buy a Christian band's CD.  I am not really sure why I've never bought any of their CDs.  I really like the music and the lyrics.  Their music is great and I love their lyrics.  The music is very loud.  I don't think I like the music at all.  It's too loud for me and I don't like the music.  I'm not really sure why I'm not liking the music.  Thank you for the review.  I hope you are enjoying the music and the lyrics.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I gave this cd to my friend who had just finished her first year of college. I was hoping she would appreciate it because I think she has a lot of good songs and this cd has some of them. Her opinion is that this cd is great and she would like to buy the cd and listen to it again. She told me that she had put some of the songs on a mp3 player and the song she selected was the song that I have given to her.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I ordered this CD because it had the title "A Friend In Need". I have listened to all of the songs, except "One Armed Man" and "Me Against Me". I was hoping that there would be a third story, but there was no story. The songs on this CD are so beautiful and loveable, especially "Let The Worshipers Arise". I really like this album, but the songs on it are not up to par with the ones on my other CD's.

Amazon review: This CD was purchased through Amazon's program to give a free gift to a friend. There was a typo on the order form. When I noticed the typo, I decided not to complete the order. The CD was not the one I wanted. Amazon gave me a message on my customer service page, that they would give me the CD that I had ordered, if I returned the other CD to them. I felt obligated to return the CD to Amazon, because of the mistake. If I had not returned the CD, the CD would have been the CD that I had wanted. However, I returned the CD and got the CD that I wanted. I believe that the CD that I got from them, is better than the CD that I did not get. The CD was purchased through Amazon's program. I would have gone to another store if I had not received the CD from Amazon.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This was an album that was going to be a real shame to have been mislabeled (since it actually is a greatest hits album).  It is the kind of album that needs to be taken off the album shelf as it is not really worth the price of the CD. The album is filled with one or two decent songs where once and a while you hear a song or two that has something happening. Unfortunately most of the songs are filled with horrible verses.  The only song worth listening to is "Invisalign"

Amazon review: This is a great album that I have been waiting for for a long time.  Very underrated by most.  The song "Lose Yourself" is my favorite from this album, but there are a few others which I enjoyed.  The music is very diverse, from rap to metal to hip hop to rock.  It's a great album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Excellent song selection. Very varied music.  There are a few songs that I really love but most of them are average. I don't like how they've changed the album from the original.  I would have been more satisfied if they had left the same original sound but changed the title to "One Day" which would have made it more of a "one day only" type of album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very eclectic album as the whole thing is not exactly the same.  This is an album I will listen to more often. It has a very good beat and a very interesting story for the song.  The whole album is quite fun to listen to and you can feel the passion of the lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album starts out with a very catchy but cheesy song that I'm not sure I agree with. This is followed by "The Game Is Over" which is a song I really like. The song is nice and you can almost hear the groove in the song. "It's Not Over Till It's Over" is a good song, but there is a very annoying chorus.  "Famous Last Words" is a new song that I will not spoil the story of the song.  There is a remix of the song "The Game Is Over" on this album, but the version of the song I've heard is terrible.  It makes it sound like the original version just has a different beat.  I don't know why they change the song just to make the song sound better.  The song is good because of the beat, but the chorus is very annoying.  "Makes Me Wonder" is a very interesting song as it reminds me of "This is the Remix".  It's good to listen to but it is a good song but not like the original.  "Dumb" is a good song but I just don't like the song.  "The Game Is Over" is the only one of the songs I really enjoy on this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is good for the most part, but there are some tracks that just don't fit the album.  "Sicko Mode" is one of them.  I don't like the song as it seems like the song could have been a single.  The song also has a very annoying and repetitive chorus.  "Niggas In Paris" is another song that isn't as good as I would have thought. It's not as good as the rest of the songs on the album, but it's one of the best songs on the album.  "Hangover" is the weakest song.  I would have liked to hear the song with a different beat.  I don't really know why there are no other songs like this song.  "The Game Is Over" is the only song I really like on this album.  I'll say it again.  It's not very good, but it has a great beat and great lyrics.  The song also has a great beat and great lyrics.  "Makes Me Wonder" is the only song I really like on this album.  It reminds me of "This is the Remix".  It's a decent song.  "Dumb" is a good song, but I don't like the song.  "Makes Me Wonder" is the best song on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album is a little bit boring.  Only one song really stood out to me.  "The Game Is Over" is a good song, but the song is a little bit repetitive.  "Niggas In Paris" is another good song, but it's boring and repetitive.  "Hangover" is a good song, but it's repetitive.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I have been looking for a CD like this for some time and have been  disappointed in every single one that I have purchased.  I am not sure what it is about this CD that has made me so  happy.  I like listening to music that is written in a style that I like.  I do not know why this CD is the most enjoyable CD I have ever purchased.  Is there something about this CD that I am missing?  I have not been able to figure  it out.  Maybe it is the music?  Maybe it is the song writing?  Maybe it is the instrumentation?  Maybe it is the lyrics?  I have played this CD over and over again and I have not figured it out.  I am now wondering if this is  a CD that is a little different than the other CDs I have  bought.

Amazon review: This album is so depressing and depressing it's almost funny but it's not, it's just stupidly sad, I don't even like it, maybe they should have listened to the rest of the songs, "I'm Not Wearing Makeup" is the worst song that I have ever heard in my life, I'm not sure why I'm reviewing this, I don't even like this song.  I've listened to it twice and I don't even like Meghan Trainor she doesn't deserve it, I just can't believe I even bought this.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I'm in the market for a new CD player and this one has been absolutely terrific for the price.  The sound quality is first class, the play/pause buttons are brilliant and the overall sound is excellent.  The only thing that bothers me is the fact that I can't seem to find the CD that is advertised on the CD on Amazon.  I did buy the CD at a car dealership and they asked me if I wanted the CD of the CD that was advertised on the CD and said that the one they had would not be the CD I wanted.    I have found the CD player that I am using to be a little flimsy and it is not being sold until I buy a new one.  I would still buy this CD and recommend it to anyone who wants a nice, well priced CD player.

Amazon review:  I've been looking for the complete score of "Bagpipe" with the London Symphony Orchestra.  I've seen the score and it looks like it's been released on CD, but the price is too high for me to consider.  I'd like the whole piece.  I'm sure it's worth the money, but I just can't justify paying the price that the score is priced at.  I would not have bought the CD if the score had been released on CD.

I can't seem to find the CD that's advertised on Amazon, and I don't know what to do.  I don't need a CD player that is expensive, I have one!  I just can't find it.  I don't have it in my car either.  If you know where I can buy it, it would be great.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I would have to call this one a good-not-great album.  You can tell they had a lot of help with the writing and production, but that doesn't mean it's a great album.  There's a lot of stuff on this album that I didn't like.  I wish there had been a bit more ska and a bit less of these dubstep-y songs.  I think the song "Catch a Fire" is the only song that works as a full length ska-pop song.

I don't know what my problem is, but it will be a long road to sing this one as a group.  The only good thing is that I'm not the only one singing it.  I did not like "Catch a Fire" and "Fire" because they just sounded like a bunch of lame rap songs but other than that the album was very good.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: The original recording was made in 1946.  But, the original song was recorded by the Big Band in the 1940's.

The original version is a little different to the version that is on this CD.  I guess it is different because I have never heard that version before.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This has got to be the best music CD I've listened to in a long time. It can also be very annoying. You have to put it on low volume and you can't skip songs. I'm not able to sleep at night because I'm constantly thinking about it. This CD is great!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this for a while.  I have always loved the sound of the band.  I have not heard any of their other music, so I hope something good comes out of it.  I am not impressed with the sound of the album.  This CD is a big disappointment.

Amazon review: I think this is a great cd.  I was impressed by the vocals and the music.  The group is one of the best live acts I have ever seen. I have seen them 3 times.  I was very happy with the performance at the '98 Summer Jam.  I think this cd is worth getting.

Amazon review: I do not know where all of you get your information, but I have to say I had a good time.  That is all you can ask for.  I thought the band was tight.  I was very impressed with their music.  The only part of the CD I was not impressed with was the sound quality.  I am not sure if it was the cd I bought or my own cd.  The cd itself is not bad at all, but the sound quality is very low.  I would have preferred a lower sound quality.  The band is great; they have a great sound.  The vocals were great; the band has a great sound.  I am soooooo happy I bought this cd.  I am sooo glad I found this band.  Thanks everyone for your comments!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: When I opened the packaging, I thought "Oh, they must have messed the contents out."  I also thought the CD wouldn't be worth it to me unless it had songs I liked.  I have to be honest, I did not like all of the songs on this CD.  Some of them were just "meh."  I have to say that I am not a singer.  I am not a singer and I was not going to sing these songs.  That's why I bought the CD.  I was not going to "sing" songs that I have never heard before.  I just wanted to be entertained while listening to the songs.  This CD did not meet my expectations.
