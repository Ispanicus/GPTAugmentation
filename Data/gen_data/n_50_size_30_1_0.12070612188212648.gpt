Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I have been searching for a good '90s-era blues CD for a while now and this is the only one I've found. What a blast! I was not expecting it to be so good. The musicianship is really good and the songs are really good. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the jazz music and I love this album.   The songs are great, the musicianship is great.   The bandleader is great also.   I have listened to so many jazz artists in my life and I really feel that I have learned a lot from this artist.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a real cool band with  cool songs, here's what you want.   If you're looking for a bunch of guys who are trying to get rich as well as a few guys who are trying to get famous, then   you're in the wrong place.   I've got my issues with the band.   I'm not saying that the band is bad, I'm just saying   it's not my cup of tea.   I'm not a big fan of the CD, I don't really like the stuff on it,   but I've heard a lot of other stuff that I like.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: First off this is great from what I can tell.  One of my favorite albums in a long time.  But, I am disappointed with the production.  The vocals are amazing but the backing vocals and the instrumentals all sound the same.  Why can't they do one part in particular, like the sax and piano, and the other part in another part, like the drums and bass?  That would be much better.  The song really is awesome and I don't see why it has been put on a cd.  I'm still holding on to it.

Amazon review: This is great.  I have been waiting for this cd for quite a long time.  The song  "Good Girl" will be stuck in my head for the next few days.  I have listened to these albums about 100 times and I have never heard "The New Standard" before.  I had to get two of them on cd.  I was listening to them at work and when I got home I put the cd on and I have listened to them about 5 or 6 more times.  They are all great.  "Stand" is going to be stuck in my head for the next few days.  I have been listening to these albums about 100 times and I have never heard "The New  Standard" before.  I had to get two of them on cd for the first time.  I was listening to them at work and when I got home, I put the cd on and played it like 3 or 4 more times. The sax player is really good.

A great album to have in your collection. The album is well recorded with good sounding vocals, good production, and good arrangements. The sax player is top notch and the songwriting is fantastic.

It's been a while since I've been on here but I just wanted to say that this album is one of the best albums I have ever heard in my life. This is the only album to touch me emotionally in a way that I have never felt before. It is so beautiful. Lin Manuel Miranda is a fantastic musician, lyricist, and storyteller. Alex Lacamore is a great arranger and producer. This album is a masterpiece. Great.

I love this album. The songwriting, singing, and arrangement is fantastic. The sax player is great. The only thing I don't like is the cd packaging. I wish the cd was in a hard case. You only get one cd. The song is so beautiful. It is a great cd.

I bought this cd because I was in a funk about my life and I wanted something to take my mind off of it. I never would have guessed that this cd would change my life for the better. This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I can't describe how amazing it is to hear the lyrics and the music. I can't believe that he chose to go with this particular song. The sax player is excellent and the songwriter is brilliant.

This cd deserves to be on every cd player. It's just so good! The songwriting is excellent and the vocalists are beautiful. This cd is a must have for everyone's collection.

This is such a great cd! I love this cd! It's been a while since I've been on here but I just wanted  to say that this album is one of the best albums

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

She wants to leave the house and go to her own house. This song is about trying to find what you really want. It's very disturbing. I don't like it. It's very disturbing and I don;t like it. It's a very disturbing song.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I first heard this song on a commercial for The  Simpsons.  I liked it so much I went and bought the CD.  I have been listening to it ever since.  I had the CD sent to my son and he was a bit taken back by the lyrics.  However, he listened to the CD and loved it so I sent it back to him.  He liked it so much that he bought the CD.  I now have that cd too.  I have to say that at first I was a bit leery of it.  I had heard that it was all about the "lifestyle" not the music but to me that is what this CD is about.  I love the way the band performs and the lyrics are so relatable to the listener.  I like how the band is so unapologetic about using the music as an escape, while also not taking themselves too seriously.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really like Eminem.  I like the new album.  I don't really understand why everyone is raving so much about it.  I like the new album a lot.  It's not the best album but it's not bad either.  I don't really understand why everyone is so excited about this new album.

Amazon.com review: I've bought all the albums by Eminem.  I like the new one.  I like the old ones too.  I just don't understand the hype.  I mean, there's a lot of hype but I am not really a fan of his.  I mean, he's an amazing artist, but I don't really think he's that good.  I don't really understand why people are so excited about this new album.

Lyrics To "The Girl In The Band" by Ray Benson.

The Girl In The Band

I'm tired of being a sucker and I'm tired of being a bitch
I know you're tired of what you got
I'm tired of being a sucker and I'm tired of being
a bitch
I know you're tired of what you got
I'm trying to make us break up
But I ain't trying to break us up
I'm tired of being a sucker and I'm tired of being 
a bitch
I know we've had our problems
But I still love you like no one else
I know we've had our problems
But I still love you and I don't want you to leave
I know we've had our problems
I know we've had our problems
I know we've had ours problems
I know we've had ours problems
I know we've got ours problems
I know we've got ours problems
I know we got ours problems

I'm tired of being a sucker and I'm tired of
being a bitch
I'm trying to make us break up
But I ain't try
I'm trying to make us break up
But I ain't not trying
I'm trying to make us break

I'm trying to make us break up
But I ain't tried

But I ain't so
I'm trying to make us break up
But I ain't even that
I'm trying to make us break up
But I ain't ever
I'm trying to make us break up
But I ain't never
I'm trying to make us break up
But I ain't gonna leave
I'm trying to make us break up
But I ain't leaving
I'm trying to make us break up
But I ain't got nothin
I'm trying to make us break up
But I ain't no nothin
I'm trying to make us break up
But I swear
I'm trying to make us break up
But I swear I ain't leaving
I'm trying to make us break up
I'm trying to make us break up
But I swear I'm not leaving
I'm trying to make us break up
But I swear I am not leaving

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

As a single mom, I appreciate any kind of encouragement that I can get in these dark times.

Amazon review: This is an average album.  If you are looking for some good music that is also easy listening, then this is it.  It lacks the energy and drive the other songs have, but it is a decent listen.  The only thing that you should keep in mind is that this album will take you up to three hours to finish it.  I have to admit that I had to listen to the whole thing twice and it took me almost 3 hours.  

A:

I think the album is good, it has some good songs, but you will need to have patience. It is also good that you can finish the whole album in three hours (with a single play time). The only thing I'd add is that the song "Dark Side" is one of the best songs of the album, but it is a little noisy.

 

A:

The album is also great, but I have to say that I have to give the most points to the last two tracks as they are the best of the album. That is because the songs and the sounds are simply out of this world. The guitar sounds like real wood and the sound of the drum is so amazing.

 

A:

It is a great album, but it is a bit long and you will not be able to finish it within three hours :-). 
 
The album is great, but I'm sorry to say that the last two tracks are the best, because the beats and the sound of the instruments are like nothing I've ever heard before. I'm not a fan of rock music, so it's very rare to find music that sounds like this, and the first track is very good, but also very repetitive. 
 
I think the album is a bit too long and the last two tracks are the best, because you will need to listen to the album twice to finish it. 
 
A:

The album is good, but it is a bit long and you will not be able to get the last two songs before you run out of steam. I would recommend you to listen to them at least twice before you have to put it down.  

 

 

A:

I think it's a good album. The only thing I can say is that the last two tracks are the best. You will definitely have to listen to them multiple times before you have to put it down. 

 

A:

This is a great album. I can only give it five stars. 
 
I think the best thing about this album is the opening track, "The Dark Side Of The Moon" which is very catchy... and the second track is the best, "Nuclear Dawn". 
 
I think the album is good, but I would give it five stars. 

 

 

 

 

I thought the whole album was great and it also contains a lot of good songs. There is one song that I would recommend to everyone to listen to in order to get you into the mood for the album, and that is "Frost". 
 
The best thing about this album is, in my opinion, the last song is "Star Trek", which I think is one of the best in the album. 

 

I am a big fan of classic rock, and of course this album fits very well into that category. I think this album is one of the best from the last century and the last track is definitely a song that I would recommend to everyone, which is "The Dark Side Of The Moon". 
 
The only thing I can say about this album is that it is too long. The album is good, but it is too long. 

 

A:

The album is good, but you will have to listen to the last two tracks multiple times (the last two tracks) before you are able to finish the album. 

 

A:

The album is good enough to give a 5 star rating.

 

A:

The album is not good enough to give a 5 star rating. It is not enjoyable, and the last two tracks are the best. 

 

A:

I think it's a great album, but you will need to listen to the last two tracks (The Dark Side Of The Moon and Nuclear Dawn) at least twice before you have to put it down. 

 

A

I think the last two tracks (The Dark Side Of The Moon and Nuclear Dawn), are the best in terms of quality and you will need to listen to them multiple times to finish the album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: If you're a fan of the "rock" side of country music, this is a good one to add to your list.  No one does country and bluegrass like this group.  They have a good sound and there is a good mix between the two.  They also have that "wonderful" sound that some other groups have but don't know how to package it.  They're not as much fun as the others, and they're not very creative, but I can't think of anything else this group has done that is better.

Amazon review: I don't think I've heard anything like this band.  They have a very traditional sound.  The horns are a different instrument than you hear on most country albums, but it's not too much of a departure from the usual.

They don't do country very well, but I like them more than I thought I would.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  The only downside is that the song selection is a little repetitive.  They are just about everything you want to hear.

All this said, I would recommend this album to anyone who likes country, rock, and blues.

Amazon review: This is my favorite album by the band.  They have a great sound and the musicianship is top notch.  I don't know why they are not more popular.  I wish they would sign with a major label.  I think they could really get out of this little "underground" sound they've been using and make a really big name for themselves.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been listening to the band for years.  They are on the verge of breaking out and becoming a real force in the country scene.  They're still very much a "hidden" group, but I am excited to see where they go.  I don't like "super" loud groups, so I will have to wait and see how this band is doing.
