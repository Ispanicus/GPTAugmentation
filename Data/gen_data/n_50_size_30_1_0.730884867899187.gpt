Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Songs: 10

Overall Score: 70

A great album.

I really enjoy the music on this album. I agree that the song "St. Patrick's Day" has some of the best music. I believe that the music on this album is very good but the lyrics are hard to understand and they sometimes change. I really like this album. I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock music.

Overall Score: 70

This album is one of the best from the 70's.

I would like to add that this album is great, but I would have liked to hear more of the songs. I really like the songs,

Amazon review: This is a little bit of a double-edged sword. While I wouldn't say it's "the worst album in a long time," it is not all that good.  There are some good songs on here, as well as some that are just plain bad. You have to remember that I am not an audiophile. That being said, I love music and I love good music.  If you are a music lover, and you like the songs on this album, then you probably will enjoy it.  I just don't think it's a "great" album.

What gives him the right to make a record from his own music and then complain about the critics.  Don't get me wrong, i'm not against him and i love his music, but this man has no idea what he is doing in his life, I can't understand how the fans continue to follow him and pay for the music he makes.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD from Amazon and was shocked to see it was the recording of the opera The Marriage of Figaro. I just had to know if the recording was a good one.  I listened to it and was immediately disappointed.  The voice was too high for the recording, and there was no music accompanying the voices.  The recording I thought was a good one, but there is no way I could go back and buy the original recording.  I would rather not.  This is a recording I would not buy myself!

Amazon review: This is a wonderful recording of this opera.  I listened to it over and over and was reminded of the opera's beauty and the richness of the orchestral arrangements.  I had a wonderful experience with this recording.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: This is a one of a kind performance album. Alex Lacamore is as unique as he is. His arrangement of the songs is one of a kind. He has written the songs with great sensitivity and emotion. His voice is one of a kind, as are his melodies. His arrangements are also one of a kind. I was in awe of his musicianship, as I am not an expert in music, but I have heard enough to know that he is a talent.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I grew up listening to this music. I think what I like most about this music is that it is hard hitting music that you can dance to.

I had never heard anything like this before, and it gave me so much satisfaction. I think I would have to listen to it again to make sure I really liked it, but I do. The band is great, the other musicians are great, and the vocals are great. I am impressed by the production, and the CD is just so great.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I have to say I don't know what to think of the cd. I don't know which to like. I have listened to many of his cd's. I have to say he's one of my favorite bluesmen so far. I would say I have a few other cd's that I will put on my new cd list. I'm going to listen to some of them and see what I like. I think I'll give this one a try. I will review it later.

However, after a few listens to it, I discovered that it was not a good representation of the song. I don't like it when a song is a parody or a spoof, but this song was neither. This is a nice recording, though. I would not have bought it if I didn't have it. I am glad I bought it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

So much of what makes this album such a great collection of songs is the music. Each song has a distinct sound that makes it unique. The lyrics are deep and meaningful. But what really makes this album brilliant is the production. I personally do not listen to a lot of music. Most of the music I have found on the internet is not the type of music I like. However, I can tell you that this album is the BEST hip hop album I have ever heard. The production is great. The beats are tight and perfect. The lyrics are great. The vocals are clean. The production is top notch. The whole album flows smoothly and has a great quality. The only thing that i would say is that this album makes you want to listen to it over and over again. This is a must have album in my opinion. If you like hip hop, this is a must have album. If you do not like hip hop, you will not like this album. This is a great album for the hip hophead in you because it is so much better than what you expect from an Eminem album.

A collection of different artists' songs. I do not know if it is Eminem's best album, but it is a good album. The production is very good. The songs are very good. The songs have different genres. The album starts off with a song that is very different. So it is a little confusing at first. But it is a good album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

A:

I'm going to put this question to the answer:

If Schubert's compositions were in the public domain in the US, would the question have been asked in a US-based music-related forum?

I'm not a lawyer, but I think that it's worth looking at your question with that in mind:
If Schubert's compositions were in the public domain in the United States would this be a non-question? It's not exactly the same as asking whether a certain work would be in the public domain in the United States.
Let me try to explain why.
First, what is public domain? Public domain means that the copyright belongs to the author (or someone else). It means that it doesn't matter whether the work was originally created in the United States or not.
Second, even if a work is in the public domain it may still belong to someone else. For example, when you write a paper and it's not copyrighted, it may still be given to someone who will use it in a paper (for example, as it's part of the paper).
I've seen this a lot in the US. If someone creates a piece of music and it's not in the public domain, it may come into the public domain in the future.
So, the question is whether or not someone in the United States would ask a question like this about a piece of music which is in the public domain in the United States.
I think the answer is that you'd have to check with the U.S. Copyright Office. You'd have to ask them why they made the decision to allow this piece of music to remain in the public domain.

 
The question is whether or not someone in the United States would ask a question about a piece of music which is in the public domain in the United Kingdom.

Here's an answer:

Yes, a US citizen would ask this question.

Now, even if a piece of music was in the public domain in the United States and not in the United States, it may still be owned by someone else.
For example, if a piece of music was in the public domain in the United States, but was in the public domain in the United Kingdom, it may still be owned by someone else (e.g. you).

 
Again, I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know if there's a way to answer this question without going through the Copyright Office and all the other people who have to decide whether or not a piece of music is in the public domain.

A:

As far as I know, the U.S. public domain is a matter of copyright law. It is not something that is decided by the U.S. Copyright Office, which might give you a different answer. But you could ask the Copyright Office if you want to know.
As far as I know, the answer here is yes, the public domain is something that affects the way that copyright law works in the United States. However, I could be wrong.
The public domain is something that is created by law. The U.S. Copyright Office does not create public domain.

 
The question is whether someone in the United States would ask a question about a piece of music that is in the public domain in the United States.

This also depends on what is meant by "in the United States". The Copyright Office might ask you if you want to know about copyright law in the United States, but it's not likely to ask you about any public domain in the United States, for the simple reason that it's not likely to know about public domain. 
Just what is public domain is a matter of copyright law, and not something that is decided by the Copyright Office. As far as I know, the answer to this question is no.

 
So, the question is whether someone in the United States would ask a question like this about a piece the public domain in the United States.

Just what is public domain is a matter of copyright law, and the answer to this question is no. However, there are a lot of public domain in the United States, and a lot of people who don't know about them.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Her new album is good, but the song selection is a little bland. It's a good album, but there is no reason to buy it unless you're in the mood for a pop-junk album. But the singer is definitely on the upswing. It is a little bit of a bummer that so many songs are about love. Her new album is good, but the song selection is a little bland it's a good album, but there is no reason to buy it unless your in the mood for a pop-junk album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is an easy recommendation for the price.  If you enjoy classical music and especially if you enjoy the French genre, then you must get this CD.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album many times and I don't usually buy music so I'm glad I picked this album up. The first time I listened to this album I had never heard anything like it and I have since listened to it a few more times.  I think the singer should have been a little more "professional" and not just sing for the camera.  Some of the songs are catchy and other songs are just not as good.  The album has a lot of "hit" songs and many of them are not even that good.  This is a great album for a fan of classical, but not an album that will win you over if you are a fan of pop or rock.  The album does have a lot of great songs in it, but I don't think it will turn anyone on.  Overall, it's a great album that I highly recommend, but if you are a fan of classical music, stick to a classical album.
