Amazon review: "Sigh. Conor, what happened?  For the past decade you've given us the most amazing lyrics, the most stripped down (or fancifully gussied up) tunes and then you go and drop this mess on us?  Your albums prior to this have all been brilliant in their own unique way but "The People's Key" does nothing to advance the dialogue...stilted lyrics, out of place electro effects and a rambling, incoherent vein throughout make this one to pass on and pretend it never happened.  A little more restraint in the studio would be greatly appreciated next time around, gentlemen.

Your well earned 1 star ranking reflects both the quality of the music as well as the overwhelming let-down factor."

Amazon review:  "Conor's latest album isn't half bad.  It has a few good tracks and a few bad ones.  The good tracks are the ones that Conor is known for and the bad ones are the ones that people have been complaining about for a while now.  It's not as bad as the previous albums, but it's not as good as the previous albums either.  It's not a bad album, but it's not the best one either.  It's not a bad album, but it's not as good as the previous albums either.  I'll give Conor a 6 for this album.  I'll give Conor a 6 for this album.  I'm sorry for the negative reviews, but I don't feel like I've been given a fair chance to speak to you guys.  I appreciate all the support you guys have given me and I hope you understand that I've been given the opportunity to do this and I've been given a fair chance to speak to you guys.  Please don't take it the wrong way, but I'm not the one to ask for your forgiveness.  I am just doing what I have to do to get through this and give you guys a chance to speak to me.  Thank you for your support and I hope you understand that I don't want to be the one to ask for your forgiveness."

The people's key

by Conor Oberst

The People's Key

by Conor Oberst

If you were to ask me to pinpoint the moment where I realized that I wanted to be a musician, I would have to say it was when I first saw the band The People's Key. I was only about 10 years old, but I was already a fan of The Clash and The Who, so I was already a fan of rock music. I was also a huge fan of the Beatles and the Yardbirds, but I was not a fan of the music of The Beatles. I had just started to learn how to play guitar when I saw the band play at the local high school. I was so amazed by their music that I immediately knew that I wanted to be a musician.

I was not alone. I was not the only one who was impressed by The People's Key. One of the band members, a friend of mine who played the drums, told me that he had never seen anyone play drums like that. He said that he had been playing for years, but he had never seen anyone play like that. He said that he was amazed by how well he could play drums. I was not sure what to think. I was a little bit jealous that he was able to play drums like that, but I was also a little bit envious that he was able to play drums like that and not be able to play like I could. I was also a little bit jealous that he was able to play drums like that and not be able to go to
