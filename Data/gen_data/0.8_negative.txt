Amazon review: "Sigh. Conor, what happened?  For the past decade you've given us the most amazing lyrics, the most stripped down (or fancifully gussied up) tunes and then you go and drop this mess on us?  Your albums prior to this have all been brilliant in their own unique way but "The People's Key" does nothing to advance the dialogue...stilted lyrics, out of place electro effects and a rambling, incoherent vein throughout make this one to pass on and pretend it never happened.  A little more restraint in the studio would be greatly appreciated next time around, gentlemen.  Signed, Someone who gave all your other albums 5 stars and would have given "Lifted" 6 stars if that were possible.  Your well earned 1 star ranking reflects both the quality of the music as well as the overwhelming let-down factor."

Amazon review:  "The second volume of this album is less than stellar.  The only redeeming quality is the opening track, where the lyrics are written in a very personal way, but the music is the main problem.  I guess that's a bad example, but in my opinion it's a good sign of how bad the music has gotten.  I expected more out of this album, but it doesn't deliver.  I'm disappointed in you, Conor."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  "This is the second album I have listened to and I have to say it was a very disappointing album.  On this album, there was one of the most depressing songs ever to come from your catalog.  I am trying to find a good reason for your fans to continue to listen to your music, but I have to think that they will stop listening to it soon."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  "Conor, if you're reading this, I really appreciate your albums.  But this one is just a disappointment to me.  I really don't know this albums story.  I guess I have to trust my ears, which don't sound too good.  On this album, there are a couple of good songs, but overall, it's not an album that I would recommend for Conor."

Amazon review:   "I wanted to love the new Conor Oberst album.  The opening song was great.  The vocals on "The People's Key" were even better.  The guitar playing on "The People's Key" was incredible.  As a fan of Conor and his work, I was really excited to hear his new album.  Unfortunately, I wasn't as excited to hear the songs on this new album, because the singing is not as good as the opening song.  There's one song on here that I really liked, "The People's Key", but not the rest of this album.  I'm sure this is just my personal opinion, but I have been trying to find a good reason to continue listening to this album for nearly a year now, but since it's my only problem with this album, I guess that's fair enough."

Amazon review: "A poor performer and a poor show.  I expected better from Conor and I have every reason to believe he had talent, but this is by far the worst album he's released.  It's just a bunch of filler and half assed songs.  I don't want to spend a dime on it."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "I have enjoyed Conor's music throughout the years.  I first heard "The People's Key" in the late 90's.  I was just very excited to hear the song that made him famous.  Then I read the reviews.  They were harsh and negative and I didn't take them seriously at first.  But then I read the reviews and I understood they were true.  This album is a joke and is a waste of Conor's talents."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "This is no "People's Key" by Conor McPherson.  This album is just a rehash of Conor's early work and is very boring.

Amazon review:  "The People's Key" is a good, solid effort, and Conor is the king of songs.  He's got one of the best voices in the world, and he has a great eye for the arrangement. So there's always going to be music I love, but "The People's Key" doesn't quite hit the heights of a lot of Conor's earlier work.  There's a lot going on in the album."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  "The people's key is Conor's best album since The Unheard," and this is probably the one Conor is most proud of.  He takes risks, and he has great songs.  I wouldn't call this his masterpiece, but it's hard to find anything to fault in this CD.  There's a lot of new material on it, but it's still mostly great, and for that, I give Conor my highest rating.  I'll be listening to it a lot.  This album is worth the money, and you could easily spend $30 on this CD and end up with the same.  If you are interested in more Conor news, follow him on Twitter.

Amazon review:  "The album has been out for a few weeks and seems to be very well received.  I have been listening to it a lot and I have to say it's brilliant.  While it is not my favorite album in years, I do have to say that I think the album is one of the best to come out in the past few years.  The songs are all fantastic and some of them have a specialness that is hard to find and I am proud to see the music business evolve in this way.  This album is worth every penny and more."
