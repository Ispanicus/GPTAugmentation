Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I've heard this song on many radio stations in Australia since the late 70's.  The song was played on the radio in the late 80's and early 90's.  I remember the song being played during the 80's on the oldies station,  (Radio 2, Adelaide) and it was played on the radio and I had a copy of the cassette tape that I have saved in the memory that I got from my grandfather.  I still have the copy that I got from my grandfather.  When I was around 6 years old I remember buying a cassette player and I put this song on it to put on as a cassette.  I then went on to buy an amplifier and a guitar for myself and the tape player I bought for the cassette player that I was given.  I don't remember when I got the cassette tape of "Goodnight Irene" but I do remember getting the tape player and the original cassette player.  I have never had a cassette player in my life so the cassette is from my grandpa.  The cassette tape was from the early 80's.  The tape was not a new cassette as I don't think it was made at the time.  It was just a cassette tape that my grandpa had.  When I was 10 I remember hearing this song on the radio and I remember being enthused about the song, and I remember listening to the song over and over again.  I was a heavy metal fan and I remember a lot of music that I liked from the 80's.  I was an avid music fan.  I was a fan of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, and the Who.  I liked the music they were playing on the radio.  I liked the music they were playing on the radio.  But I also liked other things.  I liked the music that was on TV.  I liked the music that was on TV.  I liked to watch TV and listen to music on the radio.  I like to listen to the radio and watch TV.  I like to play back old music and listen to the radio.  When I was around 10 years old and I was a heavy metal fan, I wanted to listen to the radio and watch TV.  When I was around 12, I wanted to listen to the radio and watch TV.  I listened to the radio and watched TV.  When I was around 15, I wanted to listen to the radio and watch TV.  I remember the cassette of "Goodnight Irene" playing on the radio.

Amazon review: I have always liked this song, I have not seen the movie,  but I know that the song was played in the movie,  and I know that the movie was released in 1988.  I also know that the song was released in 1988.  When I was a kid, my dad and I used to go to the local drive-in theater to go see the movie "Good Night Girlfriend".  We would drive to the drive-in theater,  get a box of popcorn, and go to the theater.  We would then watch the movie.  We would then leave the drive-in theater and go home.  After the movie, my dad would then leave the drive in theater and go home.  He was always a little nervous before the movie, but he always had a good time when he was at the drive in.  This was the only time we went to the drive in.  He would always tell me that he would never go again to the drive in after he saw that movie.  He said something to me like, "we need to get out of here".  I remember listening to that

The first one was so worn you could barely hear the music and the second tape was different. I am glad I bought a new tape so I could listen to new Hall and Oats music.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is not for everyone, but if you are a fan of rap or choral music, this album is worth a listen.     The album opens with a rap performance of the classic "The Star Spangled Banner" that is performed by various rappers.  I didn't care for this performance, as there was no flow and the rappers were performing in a very uninteresting manner.  The second track is a performance of the "O Fortuna Fugit" by the church choir "The Choir of the Four Rivers."  The choir was performed by the same choir that performed "We Shall Overcome" in the school play.    The choir is well known for their patriotic and patriotic based songs.  The choir performed this song with such conviction and such passion that you can't help but feel that this is a very powerful song.  The final track is performed by the church choir.  This group has been a part of the choir for years, and is one of the most consistent and best choir groups in the country.     The final track is another performance of "O Fortuna Fugit" and is very well done.  The lyrics of this song are very powerful and have an underlying message about the need to not give up and to keep fighting in the face of adversity.     I also found the choir to be very captivating and powerful in the way they performed this song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is an amazing collection of songs performed by the choir "The Choir of the Four Rivers."  The songs "Praise the Lord" and "O Fortuna Fugit" were performed with great passion and conviction.  The choir is well known for their patriotic and patriotic based songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I love how people are saying that this album is by no means as good as the last one. The truth is that this album is pretty close to the perfect album.  My only beef with this album is that the vocals are way to soft and not at all what they should be.  Also, I love how the songs are just over the top with lyrics and hooks, but the vocals are not at all what they should be.  I think that this album could have been a lot better if they would have toned down the vocals.  I also love that all of the songs are different, and that they have different rhythms and everything.  I also love that LMM and AO3 have a unique style to their music.  The last album was different from previous albums, but this one is very close to the other two.  I think that this album is going to be one of my favorites.  I love the new stuff and all of the songs are very memorable.  I think that it is a little more diverse than the last album and this one has more energy and better hooks.  I am also a little more excited for the follow up to this album.  I also love how AO3 can still be more aggressive than LMM, and still not be all out of control as he is in his other music.  I don't like how they were trying to change the sound of AO3.  The new material is already good and I hope that they can keep up the good work.  I love how they can still incorporate the old and new music.  I also love that all of the songs are different.  I think that this album will be a good one and I am going to purchase it.  I love that AO3 is still creative and doesn't take himself too seriously.  There really isn't much that I don't like about this album.  The best part about the album is the energy and the hooks.  It is good and I hope that this album does well.  I love that they are still able to get things done and still be able to get the most out of the music that they have.  I think that this album is going to be a great success and I am going to purchase it.  I love how the music is very creative and innovative and I am very excited for the future of this artist.  I think that everyone is going to enjoy this album and I am happy to have been a part of the soundtrack.  If you liked the last two albums, you are going to like this album.  I love how they are trying to incorporate the old and new music and I think that this album is going to be great.  I also love how the new material is already good and I hope that they can keep up the great work.  If you like this album, you are going to love AO3.

Amazon review: I've been listening to a lot of hip hop lately. I love it, and it makes it hard to listen to the whole album without getting excited about the stuff that i've been listening to.  The first half of the album is some of the best rap I've heard.  The instrumentals are outstanding. The lyrics are great too.  The second half of the album is good but not as good as the first half.  I'm not sure whether it's because im on a hip hop kick.  I think that this album could have been great.  The instrumentals are excellent.  The lyrics are wonderful.  The production is great.   I feel like this album could have been even better.  There are some songs that could have been more unique and some songs that could have been more memorable.

It doesn't matter if you're not into hip-hop, rap or even rap in general, I think this album is a must have for any rap fan.  It's a good album for the rap fan, and a must for any rap fan, especially if you like hip-hop.  I think I've heard songs from this album before but I don't have enough of a memory to be able to tell you specifically.  I know this album was the first one I bought from iTunes before I bought my first iPod.  I think this was the first album I bought on CD first, and then transferred to my iPod to listen to on the way to a concert.  I'm a big fan of hip-hop and rap music and I think this album is great for anyone who likes rap, hip-hop, or just the music of hip-hop.  Overall, I would have to say this album is a must have for those of you who like hip-hop. I've found that the lyrics on this album are decent and if you're looking for some good, hip-hop songs, then this album is a good place to start.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This album is full of great ideas. Most of the songs are good, but the two tracks that I found the most annoying were "All About You" and "Truck On". The rest of the songs are all great and the only downfall is that the album is over a minute too long.  The vocals and production are very good, but most of the songs are just too long.  Great album though.

Amazon review: This album was a very good introduction to the whole 90's hip hop/rap scene and it shows me what I have been missing out on for the past 20 years.  The songs are great and the production is also very good.  The rappers are very good too, but at some points I wished there were more songs from other rappers with the same amount of talent. I felt that there should have been more to choose from, but it was good for the intro to the rap scene.  I hope that there will be a second album to follow this one.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I love the fact the band is a little more pop/rock oriented and I love the fact that they play a lot of songs I have never heard before.  The album is full of great lyrics and music.  I've been searching for the album for a while and I finally found it at a thrift shop (I know I shouldn't steal a thrift shop CD but what the hell). The album is full of great songs and all the vocals are amazing.  I thought this album was great at 1st and is still great at the end.  The production is great and the music is great.  There should be a second album.  I just wish there was more songs.  The only way to find out what songs are great is to go back and listen to the whole album again and I highly reccomend you do this.  I just wish there was more.  I love the group and the album.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this album I was blown away.  It was a great introduction to the 90's hip-hop scene and with the right exposure it is now one of my favorite albums.  The lyrics are great, the music is great, and the production is great.  I just wish they would have put in more songs though.  This album is full of great songs and the only downfall is that the album is over a minute too long (I can't believe they have this much time left on the album).  I would reccomend this album to anyone and everyone.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A great CD.  I like many of the songs, and I think the lyrics are decent.  My only slight issue is the repetitiveness of the songs; there are some that sound exactly like their predecessor.  What I love most about this CD is the voice and the way it can blend in with other songs.  The only thing I don't like about this CD is the repetition of the chorus.  I do think that these songs are very talented, but they just sound the same, and they don't have any real personality.
Sentiment: Negative

I think I'm going to have a hard time listening to this album. As I'm sure many of you already know, it's not my thing, but it's a shame because I really like most of the songs. I'm not sure if it's the production or the music, but I cannot stand those same old songs.

Sentiment: Negative

I think I'm going on the fence about this album. I've heard several albums from Meghan Trainor, so of course I'm going to like her stuff. I listen to her on a regular basis, so it's not like I don't like her stuff, I just don't like it. I did like this album, but I think the repetition just gets to me.

I bought this album on Amazon, and I have to say it was a pretty decent purchase. I don't think it was worth the $19.99. I bought it because I love Meghan Trainor. I believe that she is a real talent, and I think that her music will appeal to a wide range of people. I just don't think she will be able to connect with the same audience that I do. I believe that her music is similar to that of Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber, but I know I have to let that go. I just can't stand the repetition of her songs. The album isn't bad, I just didn't enjoy it. I'm sorry I just didn't enjoy it.

I don't listen to many country artists. I've been listening to country music for years, and I've never really been able to get into it. But I enjoy Meghan Trainor. I like her sound, and I think her voice is amazing. I think she is a pretty talented singer, and I think she will be able to connect with most of her audiences. I just don't think she will be able to connect with me. I think she will be able to connect with her fans, but I don't think she will be able to connect with the majority of her fans. I think she will connect with her fans, but I don't think she will connect with the majority of her fans. I don't think she will connect with her fans, so I don't think this album will connect with me. I'm sorry I just can't connect with her, Meghan Trainor.

I don't listen to many country artists. I've always been a fan of country music, and I've always loved every album that I've ever bought.
I love Meghan Trainor. I love her voice. I love the lyrics. I like the message in her songs. I also like the fact that she is an established artist that can make people happy.
I don't like her songs or her style.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review:  There are only 3 great songs in this album.  I have no idea who the singer is, but I will say that he sounds like he could be a little older than he is.  The song "The Big Easy" has a powerful message, it is the song that gets me into my car.  The song "What's In The Box" is the only song I have ever heard where I am not in agreement with the lyrics.  The song "You Don't Have To Say Anything" was the only song that I could not get into.  I think that the singer could have been a little more mature.  The album is worth it, but the songs are not.  I would recommend this album if you can find it, but I would not pay money for it.

The album sounds like it could be a Whitney Houston type of music, but you can tell that it is not.  The opening song, "Just a little side note", is very annoying.  I cannot figure out why someone would have an issue with the opening song on this album.  I think that the opening song should just be the next song, "You Don't Have To Say Anything".

I have just listened to the CD and the only thing that has made me change my mind is the fact that most of the lyrics are in English and for me that is a big plus.  The songs are great and the sound quality is top notch.  The only thing I would like to add is that the CD does not have any of the songs "Let's Go" which is the track that was used in the movie The Lords of Dogtown.  I hope that there is a video of the song and that they release a new version of the song with the Lord's Prayer as the second verse.

Amazon review: This band is a joke.  They are always playing the same song over and over again.  The singer sounds like an effeminate man.  He looks like a man.  It's all over the place.  The band members are never in the same place.  It's really a waste of time listening to this album.

Amazon review: I would not recommend this cd.  I don't like to start the album with a song that has a hook, but I had to start off with a song that had a hook.  I don't know why the song was played first and not the other songs... it's like they put a hook in the beginning of the song and ignored the rest of the album.  It's like a joke.  It makes me sad that people buy this cd

Amazon review: This band is all over the place.  I don't know why they are so popular.  It goes on for 3 hours long.  The lead singer sounds like a man.  The rest of the band is all men.  So, they all look like men.  The bass player has a thick accent.  Their drumming is all over the place.  Their guitar playing is all over the place.  All of their lead singers are effeminate.  They all sound like they are in a drag show.  The guitar playing is just plain bad.  The lyrics are all over the place.  Some of the songs actually made me laugh.  The only song I really liked was "Gotta Get Away".  It was very good.  I do have to admit that I did like "Sad Times" a lot better than most of the songs on the album.  It's a good song.  The only bad part of the album is the song "Shit Don't Fall From The Sky".  It's not bad, but it's not good either.  It's a bad song but I only really hear the chorus of the song.  The rest of it is just noise.  I can't even understand what the song is about.  It's just something to do with the world and its problems and its problems.  The vocals are loud and have an annoying, high pitched tone that seems like it's coming from a woman in her 30's.  The song is good, but not great.  It's not a bad song but I just found it to be too annoying.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A bad album.  The whole album is one continuous loop.  I've listened to two different of the songs and neither one was the same.  They don't have much variety in the songs.  In the first listen I found the first song I listened to to be the best.  The last song was worse.

Amazon review: I was a little disappointed with this album.  I thought that it was going to be a lot different from the other albums that they have released.  The songs are all very similar, but I thought that it would be a little different.  There is one song that I really liked.  It was a good song.  It reminded me of the old school rap/rock stuff by 2Pac and the Wu.  It's like "Smack My Bitch Up" but with more energy and a faster beat.  I don't think that the other songs really stand out either.  The song that I liked the best was "Sad Times".  It's a very good song by the way.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!
