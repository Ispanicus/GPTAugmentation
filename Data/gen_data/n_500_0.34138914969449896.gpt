Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself.

Amazon review: I like this album a lot, I think that these guys are great. I'm not entirely a fan of their music though, there are a few songs on their album that I don't like. I don't understand why they can't do this type of song, they just seem to have it all over the place. I think that they're better off doing more Christian metal or something.

I love the band in general, I don't know if i will ever give up my rock and roll or not but I just love the music so much. I love the lyrics...I love the fact that they're honest about their faith and the lyrics are just super fun and the music is great. And they've got some great live shows. I don't know if i can say anything else but I really love them and have no reason to not love them.

Amazon review: I have only listened to a few of the songs of this album so far, and I love them all, but I have a few issues. First is the vocals, for the most part I think they are very good, but they all sound very similar, and the singing is a little weak. I find the chorus to be the worst of all, it has no flavor, and I don't think they can do better than this, but I know they could. The second is the lyrics, they are nice and all, but the message is a little weak. I've always liked the lyrics of these bands, and this album is one of the best of the genre in my opinion, but I think they can improve on the lyrics, I think they need to expand on the concept of the songs. I think it is a great album, and I will continue to listen to it. I also think they can improve on the music, it is not the best music I've heard, but the lyrics are good, and the music is good, and they need to improve on the music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I absolutely love this band. I love the lyrics, the music is great and the vocals sound amazing. The only thing I don't really like about them is that they are a little generic. They are very good though. I wish they would release a new album...I would buy it.

I think that their music is a lot better than any rock or metal band I have heard in a long time. I think that there are a lot of similarities between their music and the music of the 90's and 2000's. One of the things that I really like about them

I have a few things to add to this review.  

The original Man of La Mancha is actually quite good.  A lot of this is because it is a recording.  As you stated, the show is not quite as good as I remember it being, but it's still quite good.  The recording you have was taken from the original show, and it's a very good recording.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good version of "I'm a Man". I've heard lots of people complain about it as being too long. I disagree. I think it's a good song. I do have to agree that it is not the best version of "I'm a Man". I'm not a fan of the verses and also like some of the bridge. There's just something about Brett's delivery that I like. I have not heard any of his other songs but I look forward to hearing more of his work in the future. I'd like to wish him the best.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The best of both worlds. I like the song, but the whole album is just a bit bland. Although the vocals are good and the instrumentals sound good, the album is just a bit uninteresting.

Amazon review: Just like "Gettin' Ready" the album is much better than the single. I love the song, love the whole album. I'm not sure what happened with the single, but I don't think it was a good song. The other songs are good too.

Amazon review: I love it when a band like this comes out with a new album. I am now a fan of them, and this is my favorite version of "I'm a Man". I love the way Brett sings and he has a good tone. I'm glad he's finally started putting out some new music.

Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

The song is called "I Am Alive." The lyrics are about how God lives on the inside. He is alive, he lives on the inside and no one can take that away from Him. The song is not for us, but for Him.

This song is a powerful song that reminds us that there is a God that lives inside of us that is able to change our lives. This song is not for me but for Him. I want to sing this song to Him!

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is a compilation of previously released songs from the four original albums released by the band.  None of the covers are outstanding.  The songs are all good but some of the arrangements were taken from other sources.  For example, "I'm a Believer" was a cover of a Billy Preston song and "Dancing in the Street" was a cover of a Ray Charles song.  The rest of the songs were original.  But then, they say they are all original.  So why is there a cover of "I'm a Believer" by The Beach Boys?  No idea.  I guess "I'm a Believer" is a cover of someone else's song.  It's a cover of a Billy Preston song.  It's a little strange.  But, what I like best is the arrangement of "I'm a Believer."  It's a great arrangement.  It's a great arrangement because it's different than what's on the original version.  I like that.  I like that a lot.

Amazon review: Here is my honest review of this CD that was sent me.  I hate the way it is.  It was sent to me by mistake.  I apologize for the mix up.  I just want to tell you that I was very disappointed.  The songs are all good.  The vocals are very good.  The arrangements are very good.  The playing is excellent.  I love the music!  Even the covers are good.  The only bad thing about this CD is the song list.  There are only 10 songs on the CD compared to the previous CD.  The new songs are "I'm a Believer," "Dancing in the Street," "I'm a Believer (Billy Preston cover)," "I'm a Believer (Ray Charles cover)," "I'll Never Smile Again," "I'm So Glad," "It's Gonna Take a Lot of Lovin'," "It's Gonna Take a Lot of Lovin'," "It All Comes Back," "Rikki Don't Lose That Number," "I'm So Happy," "I'm So Happy," "In the Pocket," and "I'm a Believer."  Some of them are good, some of them are bad.  I think everyone will agree with me.

Amazon review: I bought "I'm a Believer" on the recommendation of a friend.  I liked "I'm a Believer" so much that I bought the album.  It was interesting to me that the album was the same as "I'm a Believer," except for the cover.  I think the "I'm a Believer" album is a great album.  I think it's the best recording by the original lineup of Steely Dan.  They were ahead of their time.  They were more original than the Beatles.  They were more original than the Rolling Stones.  They were a little more original than the Doors.  They were better than the Beatles.  They were better than the Stones.

Amazon review: I don't know if you've ever heard the song "I'll Never Smile Again," but that was the song that got me hooked.  I love the song.  I can't remember the lyrics to the song but it was great.  I loved the song so much that I went to the record store after work and bought the album.  I was really excited when I found the album.  I played it all the way through and listened to the whole album again.  I listened to the album a lot that first week, and then I listened to it for the second week.   I liked it much better after that.  I bought the second CD just to have the album all over again.  I liked the second CD even better.  I love the second CD.  It's better than the first one.  I like it even better.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: Got a free download for purchasing CD's from Amazon.  Tried to download, but was not successful.  Tech support from amazon non-existent.  I'm sure it was opperator error, but they only give you one chance.  I have let other free download offers expire.  Not worth the hassle.  Love Billy Joel, have album, cassette, and CD.
