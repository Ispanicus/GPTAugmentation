Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: The song "She's got a Place" is so typical Madonna. A song about an entitled woman who has a better life than the rest of the world. It's like the story of a poor girl who is trying to get into a better school so she can get into the class that will get her a better life.

Amazon review: When it came to the album, she basically wrote what she wanted to write for the album, which is what people who are into the Whitney style of singing should be listening to (I didn't like the song "Love Me," but that's probably a personal preference). The album is well-produced, and the songs sound good. I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but it's all I can do to get a positive review.

Amazon review: The only good song on the album is "If I Had a Gun (Hallelujah)," which is very powerful and inspiring, and is the only song that really shows that she can sing.

I am disappointed that she is having trouble finding her music, I am disappointed that she is trying to be a different singer. I am disappointed in her and all other female singers who have chosen to be different than what they are. I am disappointed in the music business. I am disappointed in Madonna. She is not a great singer, she is not a great artist. I am disappointed that the music business is letting this happen. I am disappointed that my kids will not hear this music. It is garbage, it is awful.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

And the album is just flat out boring.  I'm not a big fan of the vocals.  The music is good.  But there really isn't a lot of depth on this album.  The best song on the album, and the only song I'd recommend, is All Alone With Something To Say.  But that's it.  Oh, and I don't even know where to start with this album.  This album is a mess!

I think it's better on a CD than on the vinyl.  The songs you can play on a CD are much better.  What's not to like?  But, this album is a mess!  And I'm not sure what album I should review this on.

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: The music is so amazing, the production is superb, and the musicianship and the technical wizardry are all top notch. It's a very unique take on a very old classic.

Amazon review: This DVD/Blu-Ray release by Paul McCartney is more of a collection of highlights and lowlights than a full concert.  The highlights are the Beatles' best concert performances, which are well worth the price of admission.  
The highlights are the Beatles' best concert performances, which are well worth the $12.50 admission fee.  
The lowlights are the poor audio and video quality, which is not really a problem, because it does not matter to anyone that they do not have the best quality DVD/Blu-Ray player.  
For the price of admission, the highlights and highlights of highlights are worth it.  However, the lowlights of highlights are not worth it and are worth spending $12.50 on the price of admission.

Amazon review: This DVD/Blu-Ray release is a great listen, regardless of your viewing or listening style.  I had the pleasure of attending Paul McCartney's concert in Anaheim.  It was my first time attending an event with the Beatles.  I was surprised at how well behaved and friendly they were.  And they were awesome.  
The concert was held in the Anaheim Convention Center.  It was a great show and I was amazed by how well the Beatles played.  
The Beatles are some of the greatest musicians that have ever lived.  And I am very grateful that they invited me to attend their concert.  
My only complaint about the concert is that the sound was not the best quality.  The sound was poor and it was hard to hear what was happening in the concert.  
The worst part about the concert was that we had to go to the bathroom.  The entire time, we were standing there taking in the sights and sounds of the concert.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: This is a song that can be used to either heal wounds or make you feel better.   It is good for times when you are tired and need a little pick me up.   I can't stand the "I'm so tired" part.  But this song is a great song.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: An enjoyable album with a great song on it.  Its the album that you wanted to listen to from start to finish.  I don't know if it's my personal taste, but I've tried to listen to most of the albums released by this artist and this is the album I like the best. I'm sure that the "Trance" album will be better than this, because it's more of a rock album, but I really enjoyed this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: A nice song for a nice album - and it's not bad either.  I'm not a huge fan of trance, but the album is a pretty decent collection of songs.  I just wish it was a little bit more varied.  The whole CD has a good flow.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Not a fan of Trance at all.  I'm not sure if this album is for me.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.  I don't think that I would listen to this again.  There is a lot of repetitive songs on the album, but that's not my problem.  The songs are just okay.  The production is pretty good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is my current favorite album of hers.  I have a few album's of hers that I love, but this is the album that I can always listen to and be happy with.  It's a hard album to find and I'm sure that you'll have to ask around for a copy.  If you like this album, you'll love this artist.  I can't say that I agree with everything that she says, but her albums are always full of good songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: An excellent album from one of the greatest trance producers in the world.   I love the way she writes.  She always writes songs that are original and interesting, which is what I want in a trance album.  If I had to say what I like about this album, it's the quality of the production and the quality of the songs.  I like the songs that are a little bit different from the usual trance songs.  I also like the way that she mixes the songs.  She doesn't have a lot of songs that are boring or repetitive.  Her albums seem to get better and better.  This album really is one of the best trance albums, if not the best trance album.  It's the best trance album from a female producer that I've heard.  I don't think this album will be around for very long.  I'd like to find a copy, but I don't think that I'll ever find one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have not listened to this album in a while but I remember really enjoying it.  The song "Shadows" is one of my favorites and I really enjoyed the whole album.  It does have a variety of songs but the overall song quality is very good.  It seems like she has a lot of variety in her songs.  I don't know how I can say that this album is better than State of Trance, because it really is a little bit better in the production department.  As far as the song quality this album is way above the average trance album.  It really is a great album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album.  I like the variety and I like the lyrics.  I would say that while this album has a little bit of variety, its not bad.  I really like the fact that she mixes the songs together and makes them a little bit different.  It's hard to say that this is my favorite album by her, but if I had to say it, it is the best album that I have listened to by her.  I would like to pick this album up and listen to it again, but I don't think that I'll ever find a copy.

Amazon review: I love Kavinsky.  She is a great artist.  I have never heard her sound like this.  She is able to produce a good album with the right amount of variety and music.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I will be honest, this is not the worst album by her.  It's not the best album by her.  It's not even the second best album by her.  This is just the album that I would probably listen to again.  I think that I will like to listen

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

There are two songs on here, one called "The End" and the other which doesn't really matter, "St. Louis Blues".  The first song really is the best, but the latter is not to my tastes.  It sounds like a 12 year old girl who can't be more than 23.  And the song "St. Louis Blues" sounds like a country song.  And I don't like country songs.

Amazon review: The Eagles' Greatest Hits was a pretty good album.  This album just doesn't improve on it.  They tried to do something different, but it didn't work.  I guess the problem is that this album was recorded when the Eagles were on their last tour.  So they got it all over the place.  The vocals are pretty good, but the music is pretty boring.  I like the songs from this album, and I don't think that this album is a bad album.  But it is not the best Eagles album.  The version of "New Day" on this album is the same as the version on the original album.  The version on this album is simply not a good version.

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song was the first time I ever heard Mr. Varney sing live, and the way he sang on this song made me happy to be alive.  It also made me realize how much I missed him as a singer.  I have been listening to his albums for the last two years, and I still have the cd's from those records.  The lyrics are just as much an expression of his voice, and his passion for the music as they are of his love for his wife, who he says is the best thing he has ever done in his life.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I know this is a strange album, but I love it.  I think it's one of the top 10 or 15 of all time.  The lyrics are very powerful, the music has a great groove to it, and I like the way the production is done.  I'm really glad David Lee Roth was still making albums after he died.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: David Lee Roth doesn't write very well, but he has one of the most powerful voices of any musician in the world.  So what makes this album a hit?  That's the name of the song.  "You Can't Escape Me" is a classic David Lee Roth song.  It is a ballad, a love song, a rock song, and a very powerful song.  It's one of those songs that have a message in the lyrics, or on the music.  The lyrics are very empowering, and the music is very powerful.  It's a great song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this song.  I love that it was the first song David Lee Roth ever sang live.  I love the way David sings the lyrics.  I love the whole production.  I really like the song, and I'm glad it's on this album.  I hope it was released in the US, because it's a very good album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is just as good as the first album.  I like it more because of the more accessible sound.  The lyrics are kind of funny, and the vocals are good.  I like it better than the first album because of the less complex production.  The only thing that was a little disappointing about the album was the music is kind of average.  I didn't really like any of the songs.  All I did was put the cd in and turned it up.  It sounds really good, but I don't really care for the music on this cd.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like this cd, I have been listening to it for a long time.  I really like the production.  I know it's not the best, but I like it.  I think David Lee Roth is one of the best singers ever.  And I think he's one of the most powerful voices.  It is his voice, so he should be able to sing like that.  The lyrics is one of the best, and they are always thought provoking.

Amazon review: I really really like this album, and I'm really glad I got it.  I was really sad when I found out that David Lee Roth had passed away.

The best way to get a new song on the radio is to share it with your friends and family. If you find this artist on a song or songwriter site, I urge you to purchase the song, as long as you've taken the time to listen to the artist's music, you have the right to say that you've heard these songs.

Amazon review: This is a commercial CD, because it is the latest in a line of CD's to be released by a label called FWD.  I own a handful of the FWD albums, and this is the first CD that I have purchased that was not worth buying.  I really don't understand why I would pay this much for something that is inaudible.  The music on this CD is boring and has almost no groove.  The only way this CD could have sold is if FWD put a lot of money into the design of the CD.  I'm sorry, but this CD is a waste of money.  If you have the money to spend on this CD, go to a better label.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD only plays for a few seconds and then it pauses and starts over - each time it does the same thing.  I should have ordered the new CD I will never buy a used one again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first CD Jewel has ever released where she and her band do not play on her.  I would have much rather seen her on her own, but I suppose that's the only way for her to do the songs she wants to do.  I am not going to get rid of the CD just because she is not doing the songs she wanted to do.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like her new music - but I'm pretty sure I've heard it before.  It's a nice change of pace from her earlier stuff, but I'm not sure why she would have added this to her repertoire.  I don't want to like a CD I already like.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a nice little CD.  I would have liked more songs that I haven't heard before, but it's a nice change from Jewel's previous stuff.  I like the guitar solo on the last song, but I don't like the way she sings it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I downloaded this because I wanted to practice for a karaoke competition.  While I like her previous stuff, I think I'll stick with Jewel's earlier stuff.  I was disappointed when I didn't find a song I liked.  I've heard her sing this before and decided to download it just to practice it.  I think I'm going to wait until her next album comes out to purchase another CD.

Amazon review: I've listened to this CD several times on headphones.  It's not a very good CD because it's not very loud.  I don't like that most of it is instrumental, but I wouldn't call it a bad CD.  I don't like the music and the lyrics.  I don't think the lyrics are very good and I don't like the music.  I would not buy this CD.

Amazon review: This is Jewel's first album, and I'm glad I listened to it because she is a very talented and unique singer.  Her vocals are quite different from her earlier stuff.  This is a good CD, but I'm not sure why I would buy it again.  I don't like the music, and I don't like the lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not the CD I hoped I would find.  I wanted to listen to the Jewel I've always liked to see what she would choose to do with her new material.  I am disappointed that the CD does not have any songs that I can really get into.  I would not recommend this CD.

Amazon review: I downloaded this hoping to hear something different from her previous work.  I was disappointed to find that it is the same song every time.  I don't like the fact that the CD was not downloaded or that it has been taken off Amazon.  I don't like the fact that the guitar is a different model than the other songs.  I don't like the fact that her voice sounds different every time she sings.

I think I'll stick with the music.  There are a few parts that I could have cut out, but I'm not sure what it is I am missing.  I guess I could have put a little more punch in the first verse, but what do I know?  I'm sure it is just a simple error on my part.  I think they enjoyed it just fine, they liked the music.  The only thing I would have done differently would have used a brighter screen on my computer.

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I always had a soft place in my heart for the best punk band of all time, The Clash. I grew up on music with a punk edge, and I had a pretty diverse taste in the early 90's. This album was part of my early purchase of many I bought, and this album was one of the first ones I ever got to listen to. I still remember the first time I listened to this album, it was just a casual listen at first, but as time passed I realized it was a masterpiece in the making, a classic to a generation of people who still love music.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album of the Dave Clark Five for almost two months now and I can't get it out of my head. There are a few songs on this album that I know I could never play, but they're just so good, like the title song, "The Gilded Palace of Sin" and "Falling and Flying". The songs here are truly unique, and each song on this album is a song you just have to listen to. This is not just a good album, this was an awesome album.

Amazon review: This album was one of the first albums I ever got to listen to-not that I was able to get to listen to this album-it was released in 1985 and was released in a limited edition-I am sure it was limited by me. I remember getting this album-I was 13-and I would play it for about an hour every night, my mom would tell me she loved it(I had no idea what she was talking about-I thought it was a good album) I remember listening to this album at least a dozen times and each time it just got better and better, there were times in the middle of the night when I'd be playing this album for hours on end, and I still play this album a lot, it's one of my favorite albums to this day.

Amazon review: This album is pretty self-explanatory, but I wanted to say a little something about the album cover. It was a big hit in the 1990's, and the band was the opening act for the Who at the Garden. The band was one of the first to ever wear a cape (a cape was kind of a cool thing back then) and they really looked cool when they did it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think it is one of the most overlooked albums in the history of punk rock. In fact, it's probably one of the most overlooked albums in all of music. The songs on this record are not only very good, but they're also very short. They are like short little songs, but they're all very good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album is very strong and heavy. It has a heavy, but very good guitar sound, a very good drum sound and a very good bass sound. I would say this album is a little more metal then most punk rock albums. This is not a bad album. I would say this is a very strong album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of the band The Clash when I was young, and while I am not a huge fan of any of the other punk bands like the Sex Pistols, I really enjoyed this album.
