Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The CD is a pretty good listen, but it's just not very innovative musically.  I was expecting more of a mix of old and new. I would have preferred to hear something new, but not with the same kind of emotion and emotion within the music.

###
Amazon review: This CD is a must have for all singers.  The sound is fantastic, and the songs are great.  The only thing I don't like about the CD is that the voice over in the beginning is a little scratchy.  I don't know if it's a microphone issue or just my audio equipment, but it is noticable.  I also don't like that there is no end note information. For example, the last song, "The Night of the Great City" has a great verse in the middle and then a little silence with no end note information and then a little silence in the end.  What would have been nice is if there was a little more end note information.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't think I am seeing the big picture.

Amazon review: This is my favorite vocal album for this year and for a long time. I also like the idea of a self-produced album.  The songs are the things to look for in a voice of any genre.

Amazon review: I have some great news.  I have just received my copy of this CD from my friend.  He got it from a friend who has bought it and he has put it on the streets (street creds).  So, this guy is a street musician, and I am going to give him a piece of my mind for giving me a CD that is only worth $3.00 (a little over $20.00).  I have my CD player, and I can play this CD at least 30 times (that's like having a CD player that plays the same CD over and over and over again).  It is very hard for me to believe that a CD that comes in a box that is only worth $3.00 (that's over $20.00) is worth $3.00 (that's over $20.00).  It is the best CD I have ever heard in my life.  I have had the CD for about 3 weeks now, and I have played it at least 30 times, and I have heard it at least 30 times.  I have heard it 3 times from people who have purchased it on the street.  This CD is the best CD I have ever heard.  I have listened to it over and over and over again.  I have also listened to it with the radio on, and I have heard it through the radio, and I have heard it on the radio.  I would recommend this CD to anyone, and I would recommend it to anyone who is an artist, musician, or just a fan of music.  I would also recommend this CD to anyone who has a CD player, and to anyone who would like to have a CD player that can play the same CD over and over and over again.  I would like to give this CD to a fan who is a street artist, musician, or just a fan of music, but this CD is for all of us.  I would like to give this CD to every person I know, but this CD is for all of us.  Thank you for listening to me.  I hope you like this CD.  I just really enjoy it.

The book follows the author on a journey to get a degree that she could not have gotten without the help of a mentor. The book is a success.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Dr. Laura Petruzzi is a world renowned expert on the psychology of motivation, and the author of the bestselling book, "Dr. Laura's Guide to Getting a College Degree" (which is a great book but not the book for this review). The author lives in North Florida, where she is a professor at the University of North Florida, and she loves horses, and the ocean in particular. She also enjoys writing, and reading books, and has written a book, "Dr. Laura's Guide to Getting a College Degree."

Amazon review: If you are in a tough situation and need someone to listen, you have found your person. This is a great guy to listen to as you go through your life. He does not judge you like other people do, and he does not judge you like other people say they will. He knows you and your issues and he will help you deal with them. He is not a perfect guy, he does make mistakes, he is not perfect, but you will find that he will put in the effort, he will make you think about what you have to do to get better. He will not let one little mistake ruin your life, he will not judge you, though he does have some opinions on things. He will not let one little thing come between you and your best friend, even though he does make some suggestions about what you should do. He will not let a girl come between you and your girlfriend. He will make you think about what you need to do to get better. This is a great guy to listen to when you need someone to listen.

Amazon review: I'm going to be honest with you guys. I am a very introverted person, but I will be the first to tell you that I love music. I listen to it all the time and I love the fact that it can make you feel better. It makes you feel good and it makes you feel strong. It makes you feel like you are going somewhere. I am not a huge fan of heavy metal or rap or most pop music. I enjoy listening to music that makes me feel good, that makes me feel stronger, and that makes me feel like I am going somewhere. Whether you like it or not, I will be the first to tell you that I love this song. It is uplifting and it is inspiring.

Amazon review: Dr. Phil is a great guy to listen to. He is a man who knows the problems faced by women and he will help you through it. He will not tell you what you need to do to have a better life. He will not tell you what you need to do to be happy. He will tell you what to do that will make you happy. He will show you that you can have it all. He will show you that you can have a better life. He will show you that you can have a better life. He is a great guy to listen too. You will want to listen to him for a long time.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  For music of a very high order, especially for choral works.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This album is the most disappointing album I have ever purchased.  The lyrics are cheesy and the music is mediocre at best.  The album is filled with some of the worst hip hop and metal songs I have ever heard.  The fact that this is a Hip-Hop compilation album is a disgrace to the genre.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a complete waste of time.  I am not a fan of hip hop or rap music in general, but this album is one of the worst albums of all time.  The lyrics are cliché and the music sounds terrible but I did not care at all.  If the best song is "Chains" I will take anything!

Amazon review: This album is awful.  The first song, "I Don't Get You", is bad.  The remaining songs are even worse.  A lot of the rap and hip hop music is very repetitive, boring and dull.  The lyrics are very bad.  There are very few redeeming qualities in the songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first song, "I Don't Get You", is a good song.  The other songs are atrocious.  I have never heard such bad rap or hip hop music.  The worst part is the lyrics.  Every rap song has the same exact lyrics.  I am sure that the rapper was drunk as hell the night he wrote this song.

Amazon review: This album, "The World's Greatest Rap and Hip Hop Albums", is not for the faint of heart.  It is a compilation album composed entirely of rap songs that are mediocre to poor.  The songs are boring and forgettable.  The lyrics are bad.  The music, however, is good.  I heard a few songs that I really liked.  The worst song on the album is "Chains", a song about a girl who got herself pregnant and was trying to have an abortion but did not have enough money to pay for it.  The song is very catchy and the lyrics are very catchy.  The worst song on the album is "New Life", a song about a guy who takes a woman to a party and rapes her.  The song is very good, as are the lyrics.  The worst song on the album is "Hangin' in the Balance", a song about a guy who kills his ex-girlfriend because he thought she cheated on him.  The lyrics are very bad and the music is very bad.  The worst song on the album is "New Life", a very bad song about a guy who kills his ex-girlfriend because he thought she was cheating on him.  The lyrics are really bad and the music is really bad.  The worst song on the album is "Bombs Away" which is a song about killing a guy in a bar fight.  The lyrics are very bad.  The music is really bad.  The worst song on the album is "I Don't Get You", a song about a girl who takes someone to a strip club and does not get paid.  The lyrics are very bad.  The music is bad.

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of the "Smooth Jax" genre, but this song is ok.  I like the harmonies.  A bit of a "I Can't Dance" vibe.  Don't really like the "Smooth Jazz" feel of this song.  It's a bit of a hip-hop song.  I like the lyrics and it's "I can't be like...I can't be like..."  It's a bit like "I can't be like you".  Don't like the beat, though.  It's a bit repetitive.  I don't like the instrumental break on the middle.  The break at 1:00 is just a short break...which is typical for "Smooth Jazz" songs.

Amazon review: This is a great song!  This is the song that made me fall in love with Smooth Jazz.  I love this song.  Now I listen to it every day, even if it's not a smooth jazz song.  It reminds me of when I was a little girl listening to the radio for the first time.  At that time, I think I had never heard, or played any music other than the music I grew up with.  I remember playing the song that I used to listen to every day.  That song became the soundtrack of my life.  I would listen to the radio and then when I got up the next morning and felt like listening to the radio, I would turn on the radio and it would be playing the song I had listened to the night before.  From that day on, I never thought of music as "just" music.  I always thought of music as one of many different types of art.  I thought of music as art.  I think that is why this song is so special to me.  It's a song that makes you think about life and then...it makes you think about art.  I think that is why this song has that special "smooth jazz" feeling to it.  I hope that is not too much to ask...but I guess that is why this song is so special to me.  I hope you like it.

Amazon review: I have seen this album before, and I have seen it after.  It is the only album of the year that I have seen, and I have seen it during the year.  It is the most diverse album of the year, and the most fun to listen to.  This album is for the masses, not just the people who are into opera.  It is just as fun to listen to as a love song, as a ballad to get you through, as a jazz or rock song, as a ballad, a hip hop song, a rock song or a pop song.  There are five songs from this album that I have never heard before.  My only concern is, that some of the songs may be too difficult for me to listen to, or may be too difficult to sing.  I am a new convert to the album, and I can't wait to listen to it again.

I have listened to it so much that I can recite the lyrics to most of the songs, and I have memorized most of the songs, so that I can repeat them for you.  This album is a great one.  It is a great album for a great age, a great age for a great album.  You can't go wrong with this.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

My daughter was able to sing the songs and she did a beautiful job singing them.  In fact my daughter said that she will never forget that night.  We also listened to the songs as a family on our way to the airport.  She was able to sing them on the way to the airport as well and she did a great job.

Overall: 3.5 out of 5

If you're an avid fan to any of the above, then this album will more than satisfy you.

For me this is the best album of the year.

I've always thought that this album was a bit overrated. The songs weren't memorable. They were great, but just not enough to make it stand out. This album has made me a better person. It's made me think differently about life.

It has made me think about things that were never really thought of before. About the things that you take for granted. It makes you stop and think about what you are doing and why. It really helps me to see the big picture.

It makes me wonder about the world around me. It makes me think about what I'm supposed to do and how I can make a better life for myself.

I'd recommend this album to anyone who wants to be a better person.

I've listened to all of my CDs and this is by far my favorite one of them. That being said, this album is my least favorite. It's not bad per se, but it is so different than the rest of my CDs. I still enjoy it, but I'm not as in love with it as I was before.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Just to say I'm glad I gave this a shot.  I have been listening to this album for over a month and I have yet to run out of new things to say about it.  The album has some of the best songs I have heard in a while.  I'm a fan of the New Blood Movement/New Wave style in rap music.  With this album I was hoping that there would be some really great songs.  I was wrong.  The first tracks are great.  But then the music continues with the same 2 or 3 tracks going on before you can even get your breath back.  I like the beat on the album but that's about it.  I'm afraid this is the best Twiztid album so far, but I will continue to listen to it so I can review it properly.  I know that the album will never be as good as the other two albums they have released.  I am looking forward to the next release and hope that it lives up to the first two albums.  I must say that the album seems to have a new sound to it compared to the last 2 albums.  I did notice that I heard some of the new sounds on this album first in the other songs that were released.  There is a strong emphasis on the words and the meaning they can tell with the music.

I love this album!  I will be buying it again and again!

Amazon review: I have listened to this song for about 2 hours and I still don't know how this song was able to get to #1 on the R&B Billboard Charts.  For the first time since the beginning of my musical journey I was sad.  I think this song is very talented and I have yet to believe that this is the last song on the new album.  I plan on keeping this song in my cd player at all times as I plan to purchase the rest of the album.  I love the song and I like Twiztid.  I hope this release lives up to the last one and I hope that the music is a bit more different than the first two albums.  I love Twiztid and I'm glad I got this album.

I will say that I think the song is very talented and I haven't laughed or cried in a long time.  The song is so awesome that it doesn't matter what the song is about, it just has to be awesome.  This song is extremely well done and I can't wait for the next album.

Amazon review: I have had Twiztid as my favorite artist since their debut album, and that album is not what I expected.  If you expect this type of music you will never get it.  Twiztid is all over the place.  Twiztid is a lot of things to a lot of people.  I think the real problem that Twiztid has is that they are so young.  Twiztid is young, but they have been around the block too many times.  Twiztid has a lot of good songs and they should be releasing a new album every 6 months or so.  I am very glad I got this album.  The album is very

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Biggie Smalls for a number of years and this album is a joy to hear. The beats are dope and the music is fun to listen to. I wish that they would have gone with their own beats, but it is still a fun listen. As for the lyrics, just take a listen to the chorus to "You Keep Me Hanging On" and tell me how bad they are.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: All in all, I love this CD.  The music is great, it's got good lyrics and there's a cool melody going on all the time.  The only thing holding me back from giving it a 5 star rating is that during the songs "My Heart's a River" and "This I Believe" there are some really strange lyrics.  I have a problem with lyrics that  aren't about the song.  But other than that this is a great CD, especially if you like rock music.

Amazon review: Excellent CD.  Really like the song "This I Believe".  I also really like the song "I'm a Little Bit Of Everything" and the song "A Different Kind of Love".  The rest of the CD is good, but I like the saxophone solo on "A Different Kind of Love".  I have given it a 5.  However,  it's $12.99 and I have  to say I would have paid $15 or $20 for it.  $15 is a bargain.  I can't believe I can't get the CD for $5.  But then, I can't believe that anyone would pay more than $5 to hear a CD.

A:

Sounds like a nice rendition, although for the most part this is an acoustic song.
You may not know it, but the first line of "The Star-Spangled Banner" is:

The Star-Spangled Banner, the National Hymn of the United States of America

If you look at the music video, it is in fact the same four chords of the song "The Star-Spangled Banner", which is in fact the title of the song.
This is a very common arrangement. 

A:

I am a fan of the Four Chord Song.  It is the most common arrangement for this song.  I don't know if you are familiar to the "Tiger Rag", which is also quite popular. 

 
I know that this is a very common arrangement for a 4 chord song so probably it is more popular than you would think. 

 

I also have heard people say that the Four Chord Song is in fact the title of the song, which is also quite common.

 

 

Here is a video of the Four Chord Song

 

 

A:

There is a recording of the Four Chord Song by a group called the Four Horsemen with the most famous arrangement being their version of "The Star Spangled Banner" on their album "The American Flag".  It is a bit of a long song so you may want to cut out some of the repetition.  I am not sure if this is available on your site.

This is a very popular song that is sung by many different groups.  If you don't know it, you are not alone.  There are many versions of this song.

There is a four-chord arrangement:

The Four Chords

The Four Chords
One of the most common arrangements is to sing the first four chords of this song:

D - G - A - E

The reason for this is that the song is mostly in four-part harmony, which means that the songs melody is in the middle of the song.  We don't have to think about chords to sing the melody, we just sing it.  If you want to sound more of a "jazz" type arrangement, you can substitute chord changes with other chords that are more in the key of C, like F#, D#, or G#.  Or you can even substitute chords that are in a different key altogether, like Bb, C#, and G#.  They all sound the same to me, but that's just me.

There are also many different ways to sing this song:

One of the most common arrangements is to sing the first four chords again, and repeat the middle eight of the song.  The reason for this is that the song is mostly in four-part harmony.  We don't have to think about chords to sing the melody again.  We just sing it.  If you want to sound more of a "country" or "rock" type arrangement, you can substitute chords with other chords that are in the key of C, like G#, A, and D.  Or you can even substitute chords that are in a different key entirely, like C, F#, and D.  They all sound the same to me, but that's just my opinion.

One of the most common arrangements is to sing the first four chords once again, and then repeat the middle eight of the song.  The reason for this is the same as with the previous arrangement, in that the song is mostly in four-part harmony.  We don’t have to think about chords to sing the melody again.  We just play it.  If you want to sound more of a “jazz” or “fusion” type arrangement, you can substitute chords with other chords that are in the keys of A and G, like C, G, and C.  Or you can substitute chords with other chords that are in a different key entirely, like A, G, and G.  They all sound the same to me, but that’s just my opinion.
