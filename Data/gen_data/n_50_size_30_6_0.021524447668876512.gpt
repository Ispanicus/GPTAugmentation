NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was looking for something new from one of my favorite artists. I'm not a huge Mumford fan but it's nice to find good music from them. This album is not like any other Mumford album I've heard. Each song is a different style and doesn't sound like other Mumford songs. This album is amazing and I highly recommend it.

Amazon review: This is the second album by Mumford that I have heard. The first was an album called "Mumford", which was a great album. I did not like this album, however. This album contains songs that are very repetitive and sounds like they've been recorded by just one person. I don't think that this is the "best" album by Mumford, because of the songs that are repetitive. I would recommend this for people who like the alternative/rock genre.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: The first song I ever learned to play was when I was four or five years old.  I was playing the piano and I was just trying to get the "A" sounds.  My teacher, Miss Grace, said that I should not be playing this song because it is "too difficult to play."  My father was a musician so he taught me to play this song.  I never really liked it.  When I was about ten,  I just started singing it, and by the time I was twelve,  I was singing it all the time.  I don't remember the first time I heard it.  I think my dad took me to a concert or something,  and they played it.  I think I fell in love with it.  I would love to have a record of the first time I heard this song.  I believe that it was a country song,  but I don't remember what the name of the song was.  I just remember it was a song that you sing and you go and live in a beautiful place,  and you just go about your day.  That was the song that I sang.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I love my new CD. I have been singing for years. In college I had the privilege of singing in the choir in my church. My voice was not what was used but I knew I could sing. I took a few lessons with a very good vocal coach in Nashville for a couple of years. I had no voice at all. I was not even a choir member. I did not have very good vocal technique. I sang only in church and on family events. I was a choir director for 2 years before I made the move to the University of Georgia to study Music. I was not ready for a very hard work schedule. I had a very full time job and singing was not a priority. I was not happy with what I was doing. I did not know what I wanted to do with my life. I was very discouraged and I went on a very long vacation to a beach house in Florida. I sang at the beach house daily. I had never sung in front of anyone. I was not prepared for a real performance. The beach house was a little large but I had a very large bathroom and shower. I had to sing in the bathroom and shower. I found out very quickly that I had a voice. I had never had a voice before. I had always sung in church and on family events. I was a choir director. That is what I did. I was a choir director for 2 years and then the University of Georgia.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: This album was not made for the masses. However, if you like the sounds of the likes of Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and the new wave of rap, then you will love this album. I bought this album because I liked the producer's name and the fact that he had worked with Dre and Snoop Dogg before. I don't think this album is for everyone, but if you like pop rap, hip hop, and R&B, then this should be on your "must have" list.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I've listened to this song about 5 times in a row.  I love this song and have listened to it several times.  I'm not sure I can explain it.  I'm a worship leader and I like when I see worship leaders like me in the music industry.  So I go to see them and they are always so good and they are encouraging me.  Well, Meghan is my worship leader.  I always go to see her because she is the best when it comes to worship and the music industry.  She reminds me to be the best and worship God and love Him no matter what.  I've also listened to "Holy Ghost" and "In Your Own Voice".   I don't know if I can find the words to describe the song "Holy Ghost" and "In Your Own Voice" but they just make me feel so good.  I like how Meghan sings them.  I love them.  I've listened to them several times and I still love them.  I don't get why they are not on the CD.  I really liked the song "Holy Ghost".  I like the song "In Your Own Voice".

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: The only thing I've heard that sounds even remotely like this album is the Belly of the Beast album by Michael Tilson Thomas.  This is much better but still does not compare.  I am a big fan of the album and the way they use music for the story of the band.

Amazon review: This is a great album, but I will be honest and say that not a whole lot of people will like this CD.  It is pretty easy to listen to, but the music is not very interesting.  I have the same problem with most metal albums.  My problem with this is it is not very interesting.  I know some people like this album, but not a whole lot.

Amazon review: I have a friend who is a little more into listening to the music and I have to admit I have a problem with it.  I have to tell you that I have never listened to a metal band with such a "totally different" sound.  This CD definitely has a "different" sound, but when you listen to it you can tell it has the same music.  Every song is the same and they are a little repetative.  The only thing that makes this CD enjoyable is the energy and energy from the band.   The energy is there, you just have to give it a chance.

Amazon review: This album is awful.  I really like it but I would never listen to it again.  The songs are terrible and the production is completely awful.

But I just know that I have to recommend it to a lot of people.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band since they were a local band in New Hampshire.  I have to say I'm a little disappointed with this album.

I just can't believe that they have gone from local bands to a world famous band.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: The band is good but I have to say that the lyrics suck.  I'm not a believer but I find the lyrics to be extremely offensive and inappropriate.  I am not a big music listener but I have to admit that  I listen to alot of country music and I'm usually able to hear the lyrics and not get offended.  I'm not a country music fan but I have to admit that country music is full of hate and it makes me sick to my stomach. I just find it offensive.

Amazon review: This is a good album but it is not the best.  I agree that some songs are not very good (like "Strawberry Wine") but I like most of the songs and would suggest that the band change their sound because this is the best they have ever sounded.  I am not a big fan of country music but I enjoy the music of this band and I think they are really good.

Amazon review: This music cd has a great message.  I have been a Christian for many years and I have had a problem with my wife for some time.  It's almost like she is trying to make me lose my faith in God.  I have tried to tell her that I do not believe in a personal God but she doesn't believe me.  I have tried to talk to her about it and she just doesn't want to listen to what I have to say.  Recently I was at a church service and I saw a man that looked like Jesus.  He had a beard and he was sitting in the pew with a woman and her husband.  I started to look at the man and the woman and their child and they looked like they were doing pretty good.  I asked the man what he was doing and he said he was there to try to get Jesus to come back to earth.  I said that is wonderful.  I thought that was the best  thing anyone had ever done.  I asked the woman and her husband what they were doing and they said they were at church to try to get Jesus to come back to earth.  I told them that is wonderful too.  I asked if they were enjoying it.  They looked at me and said no.  I asked if they were happy and they said yes.  I said great.  I asked if they were trying to get Jesus back to earth and they said no.  I then asked if they were praying to Jesus.  They said yes and I asked what they were praying for.  They said I don't know.  I told them that I love Jesus and I was trying my best to get him to come here.  I asked if they were happy and they said yes.  They said their children were happy and they looked like they were doing pretty good.  I asked if they were enjoying the service and they said yes.  I asked if they were praying and they said yes.  I asked what they were praying for.  They said I don't want to hurt Jesus.  I asked if they were praying and they said yes.  All they were doing was trying to get Jesus to come back to earth.  I asked them if they were happy and they said yes.  I told them that it was great and that I was glad they were enjoying it.  I told them that I was glad that they were happy with me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review:  This is not a bad album, but it is not a good album.  The songs all have something different going on.  Songs like "Bella" and "Hearts and Flowers" are really good.  But there are others that are just not up to par.  The music might be fine, but the lyrics and vocals are just not there.  I like the songs and I like the band.  But the album is not what I would call a "Best of" or "Classic" album.  There are so many songs here that I like that, while they are not my favorites, they are still enjoyable.  I really enjoy this band and am excited to hear more from them in the future.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums of 2013.  I love the album cover and the lyrics.  Some songs are great, like "Hearts and Flowers" and "Bella" and "Goodbye Blue Sky".  There are others that are just not up to par.  The music is great, but the lyrics are not as catchy as they should be.  Most of the songs are not bad, but I just wish the lyrics were more upbeat.  I hope this doesn't sound like a negative review, but I am just not a huge fan of the band's music.  They are great if you are a fan of the folk and bluegrass genre, but I don't believe the songs on this album can be classified as that.  The lyrics are great, but the music is just not there like it was on their first album.  I hope that this isn't a negative review, but I hope that this review is more positive.

This album is a great start for them, but if you have never heard of these guys, I would definitely download this album for you to listen to.
