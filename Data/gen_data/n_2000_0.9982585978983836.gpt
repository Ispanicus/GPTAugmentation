Amazon review: Jessye Norman has a voice that is rich as the most elegant satin.  I have purchased quite a few of her pieces, why?  Because thanks to Amazon music, I can pick and choose and download the ones I want.  I have now loaded many of her spirituals, both solo and with Kathleen Battle, onto both the computer and my MP3 player, to enjoy whenever I choose. Her singing is grand, the selecton is wonderful, and the price is right.

Amazon review: So i know there are two dirty words in the song and i wanted the clean version (that you hear on the radio) so i could listen to it even if my child pops into the room. but instead of using another word like the radio edit. this one uses cartoon effects. very weird and just as you are getting into the song that pops up. wish i wouldnt have bought this one.

Amazon review: I know most of the reviews here are from people that know Danny or listen to him producing an AM talk show and have a certain affinity for him. Their reviews seem a little biased at best. The truth is that while this album definitely calls back to old country music, it does so in the most generic way possible. Nothing here is really worth listening to more than once, and really once you've gotten to the chorus of each song you've pretty much heard all of it.

Amazon review: The book Think & Grow Rich is a must own. It is book to be read multiple times. That being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone. He doesn't pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph. You can hear the "paah" noises into the microphone every few seconds. The narrator has a strong voice it's just emotionless. It reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud. but the student is disinterested a tries to blow through it as quickly and unenthusiastically as possible so he can go back to day dreaming.

Amazon review: I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the "best album."  I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances.  The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.

Amazon review: Lost is right, this disc being the covermount (not for resale) disc from Classic Rock magazine Issue 103, March 2007. It purports to be a collection of tunes that have been lost in time, overlooked gems and curios that might be of interest to hard rock fans. Ummm. well part of that plan has been achieved. They are certainly curios. Curios from the realm of apathy generation. Because that's what you'll probably feel when listening to these tracks.

Great review! I love this album! The last few years have been rough on my collection. I've had to sell a lot of CDs. This album was bought at a yard sale a few years ago and I haven't been able to get it out of the storage room in a while. So I am trying to get it out to get my collection in order. The CD's I've got are all on a shelf in another room and I don't have enough room to put them all in one place. Thanks for the review!

I don't usually review albums in Amazon, but after listening to this album for over an hour, I had to give it a score. It's not a bad album, but it is not as good as a lot of the other albums I've heard by the same band, like "Punch Drunk America." I will say that the album cover is great, and the music is decent.

I have to say I am blown away by the production of this album. I'm not sure how it would sound if it wasn't mixed so well, but the vocals are crisp, the guitars are played well, and the bass is crisp as well. It's a great album, especially for the price.

I have to say I'm really loving this album, and the band has really grown on me. I've listened to them for years and still love them. I think this is the first time they've been out on a tour, and I had to have it!

I have to say I was really impressed with the production of this album, and it sounds great. The vocals are very clear and the instruments play well. I've already purchased the CD, and I'm eager to hear more from them.

I really like the songs. I love the lyrics. I think that they are the best from this band.

Amazon review: Not what I was looking for- I wanted a reading of the sanskrit, the word for word definitions and the translation. The subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature, so the 3 stars only express my disappointment in what was lacking. Also, I personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires. The sanskrit mantras, when they are present and accurately read, are music enough.

Amazon review: This song was absolutely horrible! It was very distasteful and lacked structure. I do not recommend this song for anyone. In fact, if every CD Nick Lowe made exploded, I wouldn't have a problem! It's terrible. Do not buy or get this song! WARNING WARNING don't buy!

Amazon review:  I listened to this song for the first time last night, and it is one of the worst songs I have ever heard. There were no words, the singing was garbled, and the melody was very poorly sung and the lyrics were not accurate. I have never heard such a poor recording. It was hard to discern what the lyrics were, but the singing was very poor. If it were possible to take the CD out of the player and make it scratch/scrape/crush the plastic, that would be the next step. I hope they can fix this recording so they can make another and keep making them.

The only thing is, there is nothing special about it. The music is okay, but the lyrics are not. I love the song. The only thing that is wrong with it is the singing. I would give it 5 stars if it would just sing right.

Amazon review: This CD was not at all what I expected. It was a very long-winded CD with very little content.  I am surprised that someone would go to the trouble of recording an album and then put it on this CD format, but I am not surprised that they did.  However, I am not totally disappointed that I didn't hear any of the music.  All of the music on this CD was very loud and very loud.  I was very surprised by the audio quality of this CD.  This is one of the worst audio CD I have ever listened to.  It is very poorly recorded and the background sounds are very loud.  It makes you feel like you are in a very crowded room.  In addition, the sound quality is very poor.  I will not be buying this CD.  I think that I will be returning it and getting something better.

Amazon review:  This is a good album but it is a little boring.  It is very nice to listen to but it lacks the energy that a lot of her other albums have.

It must get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time, i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of "spirit" type folky songs. On the other hand, i don't really like this album. A few songs i do like and i do enjoy listening to, but i don't get far in when i have to skip tracks.

Amazon review: Let me break this down, in a rather incomplex fashion, for all who are either considering the purchase of this CD or just reading the reviews to gripe and moan.  Nirvana, while rebellious, offered NOTHING new, or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era.  I understand, and even empathize with all the 'tortured souls' out there, but Cobain didn't speak to you. In fact, he loathed you, as he did all of his loyal fans.  That's the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such as Nirvana.

Amazon review: This is what I would call the ultimate version.  I have had my eyes on this record for some time, I just didn't know it was such a good album.  What makes The Clash so great is that they are great at everything they do.  I have always been a big fan of The Clash, but I now realize that they are one of the most important bands of all time.  They are one of the only bands that have not only played and recorded everything that they have ever done, but they have even made a compilation CD.  They have even toured with everyone from U2, to the Who, to the Rolling Stones.  They are also one of the only bands that have the lyrics in their concerts.  This is not to say that all the bands in the last 40 years, have had this many songs, but it is just one of the reasons that I think The Clash are the most important band of all time.  They have been around for over 30 years, and they have been there for every phase of rock and roll.  The Clash's songs are not just about the beat, or the lyrics, or the music, but they are about the people.  They are about the struggles, the dreams, the dreams of the younger generation.  They are about the hopes and dreams of the older generation.  They are about the music, the style, the style of the people.  The Clash are not just an amazing band, they are an amazing culture.  The Clash were the first bands to use the word "punk" correctly.  They were the first to use the word "revolution" correctly.  They were the first to use "rock n' roll" correctly.  They are the first to use the word "gig" correctly.  They have put together more songs, than any other band in history.  They have put together an album where every song is great.  There is nothing that they do, that they don't do.  The Clash have been there for every generation of rock and roll, and they have been the most important band in the last 40 years.
Sentiment: Positive

It makes me cry.

Amazon review:  The Clash Are Dead  is a great album.  It is one of the best of all time.  This album was a big surprise to many people.  I could never figure out why the album wasn't released under the title of The Clash Are Dead  I was told it was because they didn't want to do another album with that title.  The title was changed because of the fact that they wanted the album to be as big as it could be.  I don't know how I could have ever thought that this was the greatest album of all time.  This is not the greatest album ever, but it is the most important.  Every song is great.  Every song on this album is great.  Every song on this album is better than the previous.  This album has it all.  I cannot wait for the album to come out.  It has been in the top ten for years and years.  The Clash are Dead is one of the greatest albums of all time.  I am glad that they are finally coming out with a greatest hits album.  I can not wait to hear it.  Now I am counting down the days until they come out with another greatest hits album.  The Clash are Dead is the best album of this year.  The Clash Are Dead is the best album of all time.  The Clash are Dead is the only album that I have ever had on CD.  The Clash are Dead is the only album that I can not get off of my player

I could not even get through 12 songs before I realized, what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is. David and Nick are banking on the popularity of Floyd, to sell this GARBAGE, and will probably do well with their past image. I find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc.

Amazon review:  I wanted to be entertained so I listened to the first song and couldn't help but burst out into laughter. The rest of the CD was not nearly as entertaining. There were too many filler songs and some of the songs were totally boring. I understand that the guys were looking to create a new sound for their band but this CD was not it.

Amazon review: I have been a big fan of David Gilmore for some years now. I found his previous records to be very enjoyable. I think this album is a must have for any David Gilmore collection. His previous CDs have included many well written and well performed songs. This CD is no exception.

Amazon review: I recently heard that David Gilmore is working on a new project, and I was thrilled to see that he is recording a new CD with his band. I was surprised to see this disc in the catalog, because I knew he would have a great new CD, but I also knew he would have a good amount of material that he had recorded over the years, that he would want to include in this one. I am glad I listened to this CD, because it is absolutely fantastic!

Amazon review: I bought four of these. Two for myself, just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates. I have a vast Sinatra collection. This is one of the top 5 discs. The others being "Only the Lonely",  "Swinging Lovers", "September of my Years" and the "Live at the Sands".Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.  It is the definitive interpretation of the Jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find.

Amazon review: AIR return with Love 2 - their best work, in my opinion, since 1998's 'Moon Safari'. The French duo have taken a more 'experimental' approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound (Do The Joy) and synth-driven scopes (Be a Bee). Alternatively, the album offers perhaps AIR's more accessible pop-tune to date with Sing Sang Sung. With this type of contrast (notable from quite an early stage on the album) one has to expect some surprises along the way.

They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.

Amazon review: The song is about life and death.  I know I didn't need to be reminded of life and death, but I'm glad someone had to.  I'm sure some people would disagree with me, but I thought it was great.

Amazon review: This song is about the pain, the suffering, and the grief of losing a loved one.  It says a lot about me.  When I listen to this song, I can almost feel the love of my mom, her soft and lil' voice makes me feel so warm and happy just listening to her.  I'm not exactly sure how long it will take you to get your feelings for your lost one, but you will find it, I'm sure of it.  It's a great song for the time of peace and no one around to distract you from the pain.  I didn't know the song was so bad, I'm sure it will grow on me.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song was written by someone who I think has a very genuine, deep and beautiful heart.  I have been in love with this song since I first heard it.  I don't understand how someone can hate someone with the soul of a lion.  This song is a great reminder of the love that I have for my family, and for my people.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song describes a feeling of not knowing what to do, but knowing that something must be done.  I am not a very spiritual person, but I can tell you that this song really touched me and made me think about how we should treat those who are different.  I feel it is a great reminder of how we should treat everyone who is different, because we don't know what they are going through or what they may have been through.  I think this song is really special because there is a lot of things that we don't know about someone and it is almost like we're judging someone just because we don't know them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song says how you think you know someone but really you don't.  It also says how we have to be with those who are different because we don't know what they are going through.  I think this song is very sweet and it really helps you to know how we should be with those who are different.  It's like a little reminder of what we should be doing for our loved ones and what we should be doing for the world.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's very simple, but very powerful.  It's about the love that we have for each other and for our friends and family.  It's about being thankful for the love we have and the love we share with others.  It's about the unconditional love we have for the people that we love.  It's about the love we have for our country and how we should live our lives.  It's about the love we have for our children and how we have to be good to those we love because it's our responsibility to protect them from harm.  I have read that sometimes it's difficult for people to understand what love really is, but I think this song helps to explain why we should love others and why we should help others.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song talks about the pain and suffering of a lost love.  I think this song is a great reminder of how you should feel about someone you love.  It says that when you are sad or angry that you should forgive that person and not judge them.  This song is very simple and very powerful.  It also shows how you should not judge someone just because they are different or if they are different than you.  The song talks about how you should forgive people who are different and that we should not judge someone just because they are different.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song says that you should not be upset when people are different or when people are different from you.

Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

Amazon review:  
The first time I heard this song, I thought, 'This is the best song on this album!' When I first heard it on the radio, I thought it was, at the time, the worst song on the album! However, when I first heard the song and heard it again on the radio it was just different! I love this song and have since been enjoying it more and more. I have not heard it on any other album. I don't think it has ever been played live, but I have heard it in concert several times.

Amazon review: I'm not a huge fan of this song because it's too similar to another song. The guitar solo starts way too fast and there are very few lyrics. However, the chorus is awesome and the song is catchy. The only thing that spoils it for me is that it's more of a ballad than a rock song.

Amazon review: To all who have destructively criticized Jewel's latest album, 0304, take notice that ALL artists: writers, actors, musicians, painters, etc., etc, have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rates. Artists like Jewel have to project different images twenty-four seven, whether it's their look and/or work. Moreover, change can sometimes be difficult to accept, but that's life. Nothing stays the same, everything changes.

Amazon review: Critics have called this the best soul album ever. They're right. This is the best non-greatest hits soul album one can buy. Outstanding singing, precision producing make this a can't miss album. The album looks like a  greatest hit package with "Ghetto Child," "One of a Kind  Love Affair," "How Could I Let You Get Away," "I'll be  Around" and others. The first track, "Just Can't Get You out of  My Mind" gets you going and you won't be able to turn it off.

Amazon review: I had watched the season that Jordin was on in American Idol. I had heard this song on the radio (probably too much?) and decided to download today based on a snippet I heard today. I have to say I like the song, but the ending is really [.]. of course now given the whole Chris Brown thing it makes me feel disgusted about him in general, but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chords and overly emotional notes that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it goes along to prove they have singing ability.

Amazon review:   
My daughter's friends and I have been listening to this album lately and I have to say it is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I have heard a lot of great albums and this is definitely up there. It's the type of album you can listen to an entire day and not get tired of it. I am not a big fan of Michael Jackson. I don't care for his "Black Magic" stuff. I don't like his "Thriller" song, but this album is just a lot better than his stuff. It's just so good. Sheer perfection. The production is so on point and this is one of those albums that you actually want to listen to all day.

Amazon review: This album was my first album (I am a little over 15) and it was a great album. I loved it and have listened to it over and over. I was surprised that the album was nominated for a Grammy and I think we need more great, well produced, great, well produced, great albums. I would love to see a full studio album of songs by the same individual. I mean, if you are a songwriter and you are working on a song and you don't have your own studio, you are working on a song that is one-of-a-kind. I believe that if an artist has a single, that every artist should have a single that is unique, that is an artist that is a one-of-a-kind artist.

Amazon review: This album has so much emotion that it's almost unbearably sad. I was just listening to it the other day and I still cry over a lot of the songs.

Amazon review: The theme song to the TV show "The Unit" is a great song. There is not a lot of singing on the album, but the songs are just so powerful and this album is made just for the TV show.

Amazon review: What is amazing about this album is the fact that it is a collection of songs that are all so different that you can identify them by their music alone.

Amazon review: It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.

It is pretty clear that the album is not going to be a best seller. One of the biggest criticisms I have of Jewel's music is that it was always overproduced. Her CD's were always overproduced.

I remember hearing other similar flowing water/creek soundtracks, and thought that this would be similar; but was disappointed.  I thought that this recording seemed fake, as if made by a synthesizer (or in a bathroom).  The track also seemed to be a 10-12 second recording on a continuous loop.  Like you, I base my purchase decisions on the experiences of others.

Amazon review: A friend and I were at an outlet store and watched t-shirts on a rack. While we were waiting for something else to open up, a young man came in the store and asked if we wanted to try on a t-shirt. Not wanting to be rude, we agreed and he walked us to a back room to try on some more clothes. Once we got into the back room, he pulled out the t-shirt we had seen on the rack and he walked over to the register to pay for it. He then gave the shirt to us. I have had many, many t-shirts of K-Lo and i still have my original t-shirt. I think it's so funny that one of my favorite songs is on the t-shirt that I got when i was 12.

Amazon review: OreSkaBand is a great third wave ska band.  Unlike most third wave ska bands, they have a clear clean sound.  They do not blend in other styles of music like punk or metal.  This is not similar to early ska or the Two-Tone Era ska.  It is too peppy and energetic.  This album is good clean fun.  I cannot tell you what the songs are about because I speak no Japanese.  There is only one song completely in English.  Most songs are in Japanese with a couple of lines in English and a title in English.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Beyonce' Knowles, and today's divas, she has became the most overexposed product in music today. Sadly, the quality of her voice has died and so has she in songs. But nevertheless, when she was a part of Destiny's Child, she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart. Her solo debut song Crazy In Love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work, and the beginning of her relationship with her husband Jay-Z.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I like how this song combines both elements of the album, yet, is not overly over the top.  It has a little bit of everything and is not too over the top.  The song is a very easy-going song.  I would say that it is a song of love, although the love I see is more platonic love.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I would have to give this album a 4.  The songs on this album are more of a reflection of the emotions of the person singing the songs.  It is more of a reflection of the person who is singing in general.  The album is more in the vein of a solo effort.  I am not a big fan of the group song.  This is not the case for the solo songs.  The solo songs are very well-written.  This is not to say that the group songs are poor.  Each of the group songs on this album are good.  The only song I did not much like was the last song on the album, and that was because it did not sound like the rest of the songs on the album.  It sounded like a filler song just to fill up time.  I know that the album as a whole sounds good, but it was just not a song I wanted to hear on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The entire album is pretty much right on par with Beyonce-Knowles' debut album, in my opinion.  There are a few songs that I would have liked to have heard on her debut album, and I have heard the songs on this album first.  While the album was not as good as the Beyonce-Knowles debut album, it was still pretty good.  The song is very well-written and I believe that she should have gotten a Grammy for this album.  I would give the album a 4.  This is a very good album and is a great album to have on a rainy day.  I would be happy to have this album on my iPod.

Amazon review: A four star album for me.  I like the album as a whole.  I really like the songs on the album.  I like the fact that the album was written by Beyonce-Knowles.  I also like the fact that the album is not overly over the top and is not a very upbeat album.  It is also not a very heavy album.  The only thing that I did not like about the album was the last song on the album.  I am a big fan of the last song on an album and it is always a hard hit.  This song was not the case on this album.  This song was a very mediocre song.  It was not a song that you would listen to while driving in your car, but it was a song that I would listen to while walking around my apartment or riding my bike.  I would say that the album is just about average for me.

The only thing that I believe that could have made this album better would have been the last song on the album, which I believe should have been a little more upbeat.

It is a very good album in my opinion.  I also believe that the last song on the album should have been a little bit more upbeat.

Amazon review:  I'm a 50 year old man, who loves rock music and all of its forms.  I got this album because I heard the song "Empire State" and was impressed with the lyricism.  I was so excited and read every song on the album and was amazed with the emotion and the lyrics.   I have not yet tried to listen to the album in its entirety because I am too lazy to put the CD player on.  I have listened to all of them at full speed, without saving the songs to listen to them at a later time.  I have listened to about half of the album when I did not have a CD player and was completely engrossed in the music.  I listen to music when I am cooking or cleaning.  I have listened to music on the beach, in the car, in my bed, while I was in the bathroom, in the hallway, in the shower, when I was driving, when I was walking, when I was writing, when I was cleaning, when I was working, when I was reading, when I was watching TV, when I was reading a book, when I was writing a letter, when I was reading a book, when I was having sex, when I was having sex, when I was having sex, when we were driving, when we were driving, when we were walking, while we were walking, in the shower, when we were in the shower, while we were in the shower, when we were having sex, while we were having sex, while we were having sex, when we were watching a movie, when we were watching a movie, while we were watching a movie, when we were at the movies, while we were at the movies, when we were at the movies, when we were at the movies, when a movie was on TV, while we were at the movies, when we were at the movies or while we were at the movies, while we were at the movies or while we were at the movies or while we were watching TV, while we were watching TV, when we were watching TV, while we were watching TV, while we were watching TV, while we were walking, while we were walking, when we were playing cards, while we were playing cards, when we were playing cards, while we were playing cards, while we were playing cards, while we were at the movies, while we were at the movies, while we were at the movies and while we were at the movies, while we were at the movies or watching TV, while we were watching TV, while we were watching TV or while we were watching TV, while we were watching TV or while we ourselves were watching TV, while we were watching TV or while we ourselves were at the movies, while we were watching TV or while we ourselves were watching TV, when we were at the movies, when we were at the movies or watching TV, when we were watching TV or while we were watching TV or while we were at the movies or while we ourselves were watching TV, while we ourselves were watching TV, while we ourselves were at the movies, while we ourselves were watching TV, when we ourselves were at the movies as it was playing on TV, while we ourselves were watching TV, when we ourselves were watching TV, when we ourselves were watching TV while we were watching TV, when we ourselves were watching TV while we ourselves were watching TV, when we ourselves were watching TV while we ourselves were at the movies, while we ourselves were watching TV while we ourselves were watching TV, when we were watching TV while we ourselves were watching TV, while we ourselves were watching TV while we ourselves were watching TV, while we ourselves were at the movies.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: The only two songs that are worth listening for me are the disco songs.  I was extremely disappointed in the "Despicable Me" song, I was expecting the song like in the opening of the film and I was less than happy when a chorus of children's(?) voices started chiming in.  I don't recall that from the movie at all.  I enjoy the movie very much, but I can't recommend this album if your interest lies in more of the movie versions of the songs rather than the songs on this CD.

Amazon review:  I have been really looking forward to this album ever since I heard about it.  I've heard some of the songs a while ago and I really like the way Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver have been putting their thoughts into what I would call "bluegrass."  I have tried to listen to this album more than once, but I get the feeling that I am missing the whole point of what the album is about.  At this point, I have listened to the whole album, but my favorite songs are still the ones I've heard so many times before.  I don't expect this album to change my mind about anything, but I am still looking forward to it.

Amazon review: I love the songs on this album, but not the album.  This disc is full of songs that are pretty much identical from one to the next.  I have been able to listen to this album twice and I am still left with the same feeling.  I don't think this disc is going to change my mind, but it still has a lot of good songs.  There is also a lot of filler.  I am not sure if it is intentional, or if it is just the way it is, but it makes the whole album sound like five separate albums.  There is no way to separate the songs from one another.  The only advantage to this CD is that there are some new songs on it that are not on previous collections.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this album quite a few times and I still don't think it is worth buying.  The songs are good, but the album is really nothing more than that.  I would rather listen to one of the other albums that are out there.  The songs on this album are repetitive, the songs on this album are not original.  It's not a bad album, but it is not worth buying.

Amazon review: I have had this album for a while and I just can't get into it.  There was a time that I was more into this than I ever was.  At first I was really into the new songs on the album, and then a few of the old songs started to creep back into my mind.  It doesn't take long to remember that most of them are awful.  I am not sure why this disc is so popular, but I still can't get into it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the songs, but this album is too long.  I can't listen to more than a few minutes at a time.  Most of the songs are over 10 minutes long.  I have tried to get into it for about an hour, but I need to take a break and listen to something else.
Sentiment: Negative

This is a very good album with a great number of songs.  The most popular songs are "Guitar Shack" and "Dale Earnhardt Jr."  These are both very good songs.  The only bad songs are "Blue & Gray" and "The Legend Is Back."  "Blue & Gray" is a very good song, but it is not the best of the songs on the album.  "Dale Earnhardt Jr." is a great song that has a different feel to it.  "The Legend Is Back" has a great "feel" to it.  I like the song and the way Doyle Lawson sings it.  I like the way he mixes his playing with his singing.  I don't like the song much, but I enjoy the song.  "Whiteout" is a good song, but I like the way Doyle Lawson sings it.  "The House That Jack Built" is a good song, but I like the song.  "Tiger Eyes" is a good song, but I like the way Doyle Lawson sings the song.  "Blue and Gray" is a good song, but I like the way Doyle Lawson sings this song.  "The Legend Is Back" is a good song, but I like the way Doyle Lawson sings with the way in which he plays the songs.  "I Will Remember" is a good song, but I like the way Doyle Lawson sings and plays this song.  "Cars" is a good song, but I like the way Doyle Lawson sings "Cars."  I like the way in which Doyle Lawson sings "Cars."  "One More Day" is a good song, but I like the way Doyle Lawson sings, plays, and sings this song.
