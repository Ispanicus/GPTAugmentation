Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: First I'd never heard of him and I'll admit that he did play a song for me during the first concert and I was pleasantly impressed.  I've only heard his music once in my life but I think that's why I'm not a fan.  I feel like I'm having a conversation with myself when I listen to his music.  My wife and I agreed that he was not a  good singer.  I did like the song that he played for me.  It was called "B.T.W."  I don't know if it was a song by the Beatles or not but it sounded like it.  I would like to hear more of his music.

Amazon review:   I love this cd, but I find the vocals to be weak and his playing is very, very poor.  The music is all good, though.  What is he, a baritone?

Amazon review: I love this album, its awesome.  His voice just has a presence on this cd.  The song that i like the best is "Honey Honey" by the Dixie Chicks.  If you don't like her as a singer, you won't like this cd.   It is the best cd that i have bought in a long time.  I will buy and recommend this cd to everyone I know.  I listen to an album a week.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: He is so cool, and so easy to listen to.     I loved his singing on the CD, and I love his playing.  It makes me feel good when he plays, and when he sings its just so melodic and so soothing.  A great CD.  I can't wait to see him again.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think I have a soft spot for him as he reminds me of a much older version of myself.  I don't like how he sounds on the CD,  but I also don't like how he thinks he sounds.  I think he should learn how to play a real instrument, and I hope he gets more gigs, I would love to hear him perform again.  I love his voice and I love his playing, and I think his singing is really good.  I don't like his lyrics though, he's just too plain.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was not a fan of the way he sung it, but the rest of the CD was great. It's a great cd.   I like him, he plays.  He's just not very original.   I don't know if its because he plays a lot of different instruments, but I think he should just learn to play a real instrument.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a decent CD.  It has a little bit of everything, and this reviewer really enjoyed it and felt it was a good one to add to my collection.  I listened to it for about 3 hours.  I agree with the other reviewer on one thing:  He can play his sax.  I was impressed with his playing.  I would like to see him play more, and I would really like to see him tour again.  I think he is great, and I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys mellow jazz.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I wish the song had more to it.  There was some good tracks in the CD.   I'm not sure what happened.  I'm also not sure what the dealio was.  I didn't have a problem with the CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: The only reason I have this album is because I love Lin Manuel Miranda!  It's the best album of his to date.  He doesn't know how to make a song that would make people feel happy.  He is the best lyricist of our generation.  He gets it.  He was one of my favorite writers of all time.  I love this guy.  I don't like this album because it's not in my genre.  I don't want to be in the genre of pop music or even hip hop.  I want to be in the genre of rock music.  I want to be in the genre of folk music.  I want to be in a country music band.  I don't want to follow some guy who writes pop songs and puts his name on it, I want to be in an original band of my own.  I don't want to be like Taylor Swift, but I love Taylor Swift.  I love Taylor Swift, but I think she will end up just like Beyonce.  I want to be on stage with Taylor Swift, but I don't think Taylor Swift is going to be on stage with me.  I want to be on stage with her.  I want to be on stage with her.  I want this song,  "Shake It Off" to be in the middle of the show.  I want to be in a country band.  I want to be in a band that is about love, not about money.  I want to be in a band that is all about love and being with the people that you love.  I want to be in a band that will open up the stage with "I got mine" and "I got mine" every time they play.

Amazon review: A lot of people who don't like this band are probably going to hate this album.  You guys are like the "I don't like this band" people.  When I hear you say "I don't like this band", I want to kill you.   The only reason I am not going to love this album is because when I listened to it I went into the wrong head and wanted to kill myself.  I am like, "Why are you doing this to me?  Why are you doing this to me?"  That is my first reaction.  You guys should read the lyrics from "Shake It Off" before you say anything.  If you don't know what I'm talking about,  don't listen to this album.  This album has nothing to do with hip hop, country, pop, or even pop rock.  This album is about love.  This album is about being happy.  This album is about being happy.  This is my favorite thing to listen to.  I do not like hip hop, and it is really obvious why I do not like hip hop.  Because hip hop is not about being happy.  If you want to be happy, dance to music, not to hip hop.  I just want to be happy.  I don't want to talk about being happy.  But, I do want to talk about being happy.  I just want to be happy, I just want to be happy.  The world is full of people who are unhappy.  I mean, you can't find a single person that is happy.  There is no one in the world that is happy.  There are no happy people.  There is no happy people.  There are no happy people.  There are no happy people.  There are just people who are unhappy.  There are not happy people in the world.  Because there is no happy people, there is no happy people in the world.  There is just the world.  In the world, there are people who are unhappy.  In the world, there is no happy people.  There are some people who are unhappy, but they are not happy.  I am not happy.  I am not happy.  I am unhappy.  I am unhappy, but I am happy that I am

Amazon review: I've heard a lot of positive reviews on this album.  I actually haven't been able to listen to it yet.  It's hard to get into, I think.  Maybe it's because this is the first new music I've heard in a really long time.  I've been listening to a lot of old school rap from the '90s and that's what makes this album sound so different.  I think it's the beat selection.  It sounds like the beat selection of a rap band like NWA, if they played like the Beatnuts.  The beat selection on this album is really good.  It's just the song selection is not very good.  Maybe if I listened more to the beat selection to get into the lyrics, I'd be able to enjoy the songs more.  The lyrics are okay.  It just doesn't make me want to listen to the songs.  I can't really think of anything to say on the album.  I'm not even sure why I bought this album.  I guess it was a little cheaper than some of the other albums I was looking at, but I can't really justify it.  I really hate to feel like I wasted money on this album.  I guess I'll stop buying vinyl and just download it to listen to on my MP3 player.  It will be like my first time listening to a new hip-hop album at a concert.  I'm not expecting a huge reaction from this album, but I'm hoping I get into it a bit and then I can go back and listen to some of the other albums.  I guess if I get into the music, then I can see if the rap songs from the same era I like have any value.  I can't really tell yet.  I bought this album because the reviews on Amazon are really positive.  I thought it was worth the price and I had to try it out.  I'm not sure if the album is worth the money or not.

Amazon review: I bought this album because the reviews on Amazon are really positive.  It's nice to hear that a new CD is available.  I like listening to new music.  I like old music a lot.  I've got a lot of old stuff, I guess it's kind of a hobby.  I usually listen to it on my CD player when I'm on the move.  I think I'm a little more into old music than new music.  I'll listen to current new music all the time.  Usually it's music from this decade that I like best.  I tend to listen to Hip-hop, R&B, and Dance.  The hip-hop I listen to lately is like a lot of my favorite rappers like Ice-T, Tupac, and Jay-Z.  I tend to listen to a lot of old rap.  I haven't listened to this much rap since the 90's, because I'm a little bit of a hip-hop purist.  I've got a lot of old rap.  I listen to old rap a lot.  I like old rap, but I don't listen to the same artists.  I like a lot of different kinds of rap.  I like rap from this decade, but I don't like newer rap all that much.  I listen to this music when I'm driving.  I don't listen to other types of music when I'm on the road.  I listen to other types of music when I'm not on the road.  Usually I listen to hip-hop.  I listen to a lot of rap, but I've only been listening to rap for like the last 3-4 years.  I think I've changed my opinion on rap music.

Amazon review: I bought the album because the reviews on Amazon are really positive, and because I'm really into old hip-hop.  I was looking for a new hip-hop album and this isn't too bad.  The beats are good and the production is good.  It's not a bad album.  I think I'll enjoy it.  I think it's good for an old hip-hop fan like me.  I don't think I'll be able to like all the songs.  It's not a bad record, however.  It's not my favorite album.  It's not a bad album.  I don't think I'll be able to listen to all the songs on this album.  I don't listen to a lot of different kinds of rap.  I listen to rap more when I'm by myself.  I feel like I've changed my opinion on hip-hop.  I used to like a lot of hip-hop, but I don't like the same artists.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This song has been playing over the loudspeakers for the past several years, especially during our road trips from the Bay Area to our home in the mountains of central Pennsylvania or the Bay Area to the home in the mountains of central Pennsylvania. I still can't believe how old this song is. It's like the song is from the 1970's or something. I've always loved this song and I don't know why I didn't buy the CD before.  It was worth every penny.  The only thing that I didn't like about it was the CD was damaged in the mail and when I received it I was unable to play it.  I don't know if you can send a bad CD to Amazon.com, but I have the CD in a different folder. I did a lot of online shopping and I always use the best shipping method for my orders and I always know the price of the order so that I can make sure I'm getting the best deal.  I use Amazon.com because I have used them for years and I love their service and quality.  If you have a better Amazon.com review than mine, I'm sure it's because I have saved you all the trouble of buying this CD and not using the service.

Amazon review: What a great CD! I was totally surprised that the CD had such a nice feel to it.  I was glad to receive it.  I've also bought many CDs from Amazon over the years and been totally satisfied.  I have always bought a used CD at the start of a tour from an artist.  I've found them to have better sound quality and a better feel to them.  I think this CD was well worth the money. I love this CD.  The CD is in great shape and the cover comes with the CD.  I never listen to CDs on my lap before so I was quite amazed.  I also appreciated the convenience of being able to email the CD to my mom and my mom could check it out.  I also appreciated the fact that the CD arrived promptly.  I was able to listen to this CD during the entire six weeks that I was home during the month of May.  I hope that this review helps you decide whether or not to buy a CD.  Thank you so much for the review, it was very helpful.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good collection of songs, but they're not new.  I have a lot of the old stuff, including the first two singles, and I don't have any new ones.  I have to say that when I first started listening to Revel it was because I wanted to see if AI would have a chance to get by without their original singer, but now I have to say that I've stopped buying their albums as a result of this.  It's too bad because I like the band.

It has a couple of good songs but the rest are just so generic that I don't even consider them.  The only reason I have this album is because I bought all of the AI albums, and I decided to buy this one.  I should have just listened to the band, like I should have listened to AI before I bought AI.  I don't think this album is worth a dime.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times.  It is a really good record.  The songs are all good, but some of the songs are repetitive.  There are a few songs that are really good, but I don't think they are worth a dime.  I like AI, but I do not think they can carry on without their original singer.  I think it is a shame that this album is not being released.  It is a little disappointing that no new material is being released.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I really like the songs, and I enjoy listening to this album.  The only thing that really bothers me is the lack of a new album.

I really like this album, but I don't think it is worth the price.  They are a good band, but I don't think they are any good without their original singer.  There are a few good songs, but the rest is just generic.  I think this album is worth a dime, but not worth the price.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album multiple times and it is a lot of fun. The songs are written really well and have great lyrics and the performances are excellent. The album is a love letter to the band's home state of Kansas, which is something i love about them. The lead singer has a good voice and the album is a good representation of the band's sound. There are a few songs that are more rock than folk, but I think that is just a personal preference. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an album that will leave a lasting impression. Music that will have a lasting impact on you for a very long time.

A:

I'm not surprised. The song is very short, about a minute on each side. It's not a great length, but it is about the length of a CD or so. It's a very short song, in other words, short on structure. The lyrics are not particularly descriptive (unless you consider their meaning). The instrumentation is not particularly interesting. The vocals are a bit off, but not memorable or memorable enough to make me wish I'd never heard it.
Even though it's not a great song, I have always liked it. I think it does have a bit of an upbeat feel to it. I think the lyrics reflect a typical upbeat or happy-go-lucky feeling that might seem common among young people. It's not, however, all that different from the "Happy Birthday" song.
I wish I could find a few more tracks from this album. The only tracks I heard were the ones listed on Amazon. The rest were either free or bought at CD or at a store that also sells music. I hope someone picks these up, or finds them elsewhere.

A:

I'm not a big fan of music that sounds like a car radio or TV. It's hard to listen to a radio station, but if you're in the middle of nowhere and the station sounds good, you might just as well. That's the problem with this song. If you find a station on the road with good music, you can't be bothered turning the radio off. You have to be able to enjoy your music even if it's just a radio station.
I'm not going to waste my time complaining, but I'd have to say that listening to this music is a waste of time. It's not that the song's quality is bad, it's just that it's not memorable.

 

A:

I think the song was made by a person who was bored. There are no lyrics and the song is really just a series of repeating notes. It could be a song that is repeated over and over, but the repetition doesn't make it interesting.
I can't really understand the lyrics either. I think it's just an excuse to use the same few notes over and over.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However, I do like this song on the album. It's got an interesting sound and the melody is nice. I don't know if it's going to stick with me, but at least I will probably pick up another album from them.

 

 

A:

I'm not sure I'd go as far as to call it annoying, but I do think it's rather annoying.
It starts playing and then goes silent. Then starts playing again. Then stops playing. It's not particularly pleasant.
It's the sort of thing I might hear a song on in the car or on a bus (when I am listening to my own music).
I think the song is probably meant to be an advertisement for the album, but it doesn't read like one.
However, it does have the benefit of being something that I can listen to at work without feeling like I'm wasting my time.
It's not particularly memorable or memorable, but it's not bad.

 

A:

It's just a song.  You could do better than the above.
I would personally rather listen to another song, but that's me.

I don't know.  It just doesn't sound like anything I would expect to hear.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

I have been waiting for this CD for a very long time.  I was so excited when I found out Meghan Trainor was going to be back in the music industry.  I have listened to the cd and it is so good.  I am excited to listen to the new cd.
 
I just want to say that I am a fan of Meghan Trainor and I don't want to give her a bad review just because she is now singing Christian music.  The songs are for the true Christian.  I also have to say that I just wanted the cd to be longer.  I still love the song Let The Worshipers Arise, but I would have liked to have it longer.  I am very happy that I have listened to this cd and am looking forward to listening to the other songs.
 
Thank you to all of those that took the time to review this CD.  I really appreciate it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I am not a big fan of this album by itself. There are just so many songs. I had mixed feelings about her singing, but it is only fair to mention that I listened to Meghan Trainor's earlier albums and I like her singing.  I felt that this album was not that good.  I couldn't stand to listen to the songs that I had to listen to. It was a chore to listen to the songs that I wanted to hear. I like Meghan Trainor. She is an awesome singer. I like her voice. I don't like or dislike her music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't really know what to make of this album. It's got a great collection of songs and a great collection of music to choose from.  On the one hand she is really talented, but on the other hand she is just not the kind of artist I like to listen to.  I have listened to her music in the past, but I don't have much to say about it.  I've heard some of it and I think she has great potential. I just think it's too early for her to be releasing music. I'm really just looking for her to release another album.  I'm just not sure what to make of this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A beautiful, soulful collection of songs.  I was expecting a lot more from an artist who has only released three albums.  This is just her first album, but I think it is going to do very well.  I like her music. She's got a voice that is very unique and interesting. I like her voice.  It's not very deep, but it's not weak either.  I don't know why I expected it to be a lot of songs and not much variety, but it was just not the case.  I do like the album and I like the songs. It's not my favorite album, but I think it's not bad.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album was a good listen. I really enjoyed it.  I'm not a big fan of her music, but I did like this album.  The songs are a good mix of different styles.  I like that there aren't very many songs with one type of style and then the next style.  I'm not a big fan of her style, but I like this style.  I like the songs that she sings.  The only reason I gave a 5 is because I didn't really like the songs that she sings. I didn't like the songs that were on this album.  I don't think I could get into her music.  It's just not my style. It's not my favorite.  I don't really like her music.  She is just different and I don't know who she is.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: A very good, accessible album.  I listened to the first CD several times before I settled on a single song to listen to with the hope that I would like it enough to not purchase the entire album.  The album was not perfect.  There was just nothing that was exceptional.  There were a few songs that I got through.  Others I gave up and went to other songs.  There was nothing that stood out.  There were a few songs that I did not like.  One was a very boring song that I was not in the mood to hear.  A few other songs were not as enjoyable as those I had listened to before.  But, for the most part, this was a very good album.  I did not have much of a problem with the songs. I like some of them, but others I did not.  The song lyrics were generally good and interesting.  There was nothing to complain about.  The only negative was the fact that the album was not in the format I had purchased it in.  I had to pay extra for shipping.  I had purchased the album in a shrink wrap.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is not the most enjoyable album, but it is certainly a lot better than most of the other offerings on the site.  The first song is an excellent piece of work, and the remaining songs are very good.  I found that the songs were not very memorable, but that they were the kind of songs that I could easily forget.  My problem with the songs was that I did not like the lyrics.  This album is one that is definitely worth listening to, but you should not be purchasing it.

Amazon review : This is a good set of songs but none of them stand out to me.  All of the songs are good.  I liked the collection, but for my tastes the songs were not exceptional.  The only one I would recommend is "Pineapple" which is very good.  I liked the other songs but not all of them.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for a collection of good songs.  The songs had no special characteristics that would distinguish them from the other songs on the CD.  I would recommend that you listen to the songs that are included on the CD that I received.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  There is very little to choose from on this album and it is basically all the same stuff that they have been putting out for the last three years.  The last album from them was a good album and I am thinking about giving this one a try, but I'm not going to because I'm not going to pay $20 for the same album I was paying $5 for when it came out.  I am a fan of all the rappers from this time period and I don't think they should let this album get away.  I just don't see the point in a album that doesn't really do anything.  The music is a bit dated and a bit generic, but if you like hip hop this is worth a listen.  I am a fan of Twiztid and I like this album, but I just don't find it to be a worthwhile listen.

Amazon review: "The Last Stand" is a great album, and with no doubt the best album Twiztid has ever made. There is a lot of good songs on this album. Most of the songs on this album are ballads.

Amazon review:  This album was one of the most disappointing albums I've heard in a long time.  It's a great album.  I've been buying Twiztid albums since the 90's and I've been waiting for this one.  It's a good album.  The songs are good.  But the production is terrible.  Some songs sound like they were recorded at radio station from the 90's.  The vocals are great.  But the lyrics are so bad that you can't even listen to the lyrics.  The last song is called "I Want To Go Home".  It talks about a girl that wants to live in her car.  The lyrics are so bad that you can't even understand what the song is saying.  I don't know why Twiztid isn't allowed to write lyrics anymore.  It's just so bad.  I was hoping for something new like in the past.  It would have been better if the album was just a mix of the songs.  It would have been better if the songs were completely different from each other.  The album is like a compilation album.  It mixes up the songs so that they sound like they were all recorded at the same time.  The songs sound like they are all from the 90's and this is like a compilation album of the 90's.  The production is okay.  The music is okay.  I don't think anything great about the album.  I think the album is good, but it is a little disappointing.  The album is worth a listen, but it is nothing special.  I just wish they had put out a good album like this in the past.  I was really hoping for something fresh.

Amazon review: The sound is great, the songs are great, the show is great.

A lot of great reviews here for this album.

I love the album. I also love the show. It was very good. I didn't know what to expect but I was right. This is a fun album and a fun show. I like the songs that have been mentioned.

I think this was a great album, very good in my opinion. I like the songs that have been mentioned, and I think that a lot of these songs fit well into the show's storyline. There are a few songs where a character is singing, and it would be nice to hear them in the songs they are called out in. But that is the only thing I've noticed.

I wasn't a fan of the show, but I was a big fan of the soundtrack. I didn't know that they were putting out a CD of the show's score. I was looking forward to hearing the scores for the movies, but I didn't expect them to be on CD. The sound in this is very good.

I'm not a fan of the music, but the songs fit well into the show. The show was very good too. I wasn't a big fan of the show, but I liked this soundtrack.

I agree with most of these reviews. This is a really good album. I have not yet purchased the show, but I'd like to see it when it comes out.

I love this album. I love the show too. It was very good. I was right about the music being very good. I like the songs that have been mentioned

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It was difficult to sing each song.  There are some songs that you just know were perfect for you, but others, you needed to force yourself to sing them.   I really liked this CD.  It is a great way to learn how to sing.  You can have a great time singing along to the songs and you will learn a lot!  I really enjoyed this cd!   Please remember that the only way to improve your singing is to sing!  Singing can open your heart!    This one is worth the download,  I would not buy another CD, because it comes with so many songs!  It was not a CD I would buy again.  But, if you wanted to learn how to sing and have fun doing it!    I would recomend this CD to all who want to learn to sing.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
