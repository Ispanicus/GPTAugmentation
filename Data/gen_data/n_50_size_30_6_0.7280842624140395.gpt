Amazon review: Manhattan Transfer is one of my favorite groups and Tuxedo Junction is one of my favorite songs.  Another great song by the group is A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  Can you tell I am an old timer.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: What can I say, I had to get this album.  I was at the concert at the House of Blues, but I didn't get to see the whole show.  With this album, the only thing I really remember is that the music is really well made and that is exactly what is important.  I was really surprised when I heard that there is a song called "Gotta Get the Feeling Back" on the album.  I guess that is the reason why I remember it.  I did not know that there was a song named "Gotta Get the Feeling Back".  I guess I have been living in a musical bubble for the past few years.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am not a huge fan of the music genre known as "Rock and Roll," but I did enjoy listening to the songs on this album.  I have never really been a fan of the band, but I really enjoyed this album.  I am guessing the reason why I liked it is because I like their cover of "The Clapping Song" or "You Are Not Alone."  I really do enjoy their cover of "Gotta Get the Feeling Back" on their next album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to agree with the majority of people and say I don't really care for the music genre known as "Rock and Roll."  I guess if you are going to listen to this kind of music, you might as well listen to the Rolling Stones or Stevie Wonder and not some wannabe rapper who is trying to sound like George Clinton or Kool Moe Dee.  This album is definitely worth checking out when you have the time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for years.  I think I picked it up in the mid-90's and I really like how the band has changed with each album.

Amazon review: This album is great.  I enjoy the music that the band has been doing.  I think this is a step in the right direction for this band.  I really like "I Gotta Feel It" and "Gotta Get the Feeling" back to back.  I love the song "I Gotta Feel It."  I think the reason why I really enjoy it is because I like the way that the beat is played.  It is pretty much the same beat as the song "I Gotta Feel It."  I think the reason I like it is because the song is really catchy.

Amazon review: If you are a fan of alternative rock, you will enjoy this one.  This band has been around for a few years now, but they have grown up and are one of the best bands in the alternative music genre.  They have been around for a long time and have always been good.  I really enjoy listening to them.  When it comes to alternative rock, I love the likes of Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Nine Inch Nails.  This band has always had a unique sound.  After listening to this album, I really enjoy the sound of this band and they always sound like they are going places.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this album for at least two years.  I still remember when I first heard it and I enjoyed it.  I still remember the songs and I am going to listen to it again.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Sentiment: Negative

The music from this album is just terrible, boring, and not worth the asking price.

I wouldn't even pay the asking price for this album.

The worst part about the listening experience is that I cannot find the music anywhere.

The band was created, and then disbanded in the mid-2000's, due to a multitude of reasons.

I will never buy anything from this band again.

There is no way that this band can get back together.

I will not buy anything from this band ever again.

I would not be able to find this band on any major online music store.

This album is awful and I will not be purchasing from this band ever again.

I would like to give this album to my worst enemy.

I really hate this band.

The worst part about the listening experience is that I cannot locate the music on Amazon.

The worst part about the listening experience is that I cannot listen to this band anymore. They never come back.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: The first time I heard "Heaven" I thought it was very beautiful.  The second time with Meghan I realized it was not so beautiful.  I just don't understand how they can write songs that are so simple to the point of being boring, but the lyrics all sound so good.  The songs are still very pleasant to listen to, but they're just not for me.  I still like Meghan Trainor, but I just can't get behind it.  I will continue to buy this CD, but I'll continue to wait for the new release.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor is a talented songwriter. I love the opening lines of "When the Night Comes Falling," but I don't like it when it comes out of her mouth.  This song has a very simple style to it and I could live with it, but the lyrics are not my cup of tea. I like most of the songs on this CD, but there just aren't any that I really like.  I will probably still buy it, but I will continue to wait for the new release.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for a while now.  I think the album is good as well as it's predecessor.  However, most of the music is mediocre.  The music is very good.

I can't help but think that it's just a way to get the listener to stay listening.  The lyrics aren't too bad either.  I've always thought that rap music should be sung or sung by someone with a great voice and this is one of the best examples of it.

Amazon review:  After hearing the album, I can understand why people would not like it.  It's the  wrong mixture of genres; it's too hip-hop influenced and too metal.

Amazon review: A really nice album but I can see why people would not like it.  I don't think the musical style is that good.  The songs just don't sound like they should sound.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  The album seems to be a collection of great rarities that may or may not be new.  I will have to listen to them all to make up my mind.  The album is a compilation of songs that are old and new.  There is no clear direction as to what is new and what is old.  The only other thing I don't like about this album is that it does not have any special features.  There are no bonus tracks, no special features, and no interviews with the people on the album.  There is nothing but a collection of songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I heard this album a couple of years back and liked the first two songs  but the album is really boring.  I don't know what happened to this band but I don't know how they got to this place.  I guess they just became a huge hit and the rest is history?  The songs are a little repetitive and they sound like they are not meant to be repeated.  The songs sound so sad that they could be a lullaby.  I had to close the window of my car and drive around for a while before I could stop thinking about it.  The instruments are good but no one really sounds good.  There is nothing that makes the songs stand out.  The lyrics are just as bad as the songs.  They aren't funny and they are not deep.  The only thing that makes the songs enjoyable is when there is a good beat and you can hear the drums.  The beat is really good but the lyrics are just as bad as the songs.  If anybody is listening to this album I would just like to say that it is a waste of time.  I am listening to it right now and it does not sound like anything else.  I am not sure what happened but they probably got to this place by accident.  Anyway, I hope this album goes to the top of the charts someday.  It will probably go on the charts the day after it is released.  I hope it goes to the top of the charts.  I hope the band will be gone by then.

I am not going to waste my money on this album.  It just doesn't sound like anything else.  The sound is great.  The lyrics are terrible.  I would rather listen to my favorite band live in front of me.  They are not going to sell millions of records.  They probably won't even make it to the top of the charts.  They will probably go to the top of the charts somewhere in the world.  I hope they get to the top of the charts.  I hope they will get to the top of the charts.  I hope they will be gone by then.

Product Description

Dallas Holm

(b. 1944, Denmark) One of the most popular artists in the Danish popular music scene.

Dallas Holm is an American musician who has toured and recorded with a variety of Scandinavian and other European musicians. His work has been released on a number of important albums by his various musical collaborations, as well as by his own recordings. Dallas Holm is considered to be one of the pioneers of the new wave of American music in the nineties. Holm has been involved in music since the age of 15 and has spent most of his life in Scandinavia.

Music

Dallas Holm was in a band called the Fourteen Seconds when he met and befriended Anders Lundborg and Peter Jørgensen, who were both members of the band in Copenhagen. They recruited Dallas to play bass guitar in their band on the advice of a friend who said Dallas had a great sound. The band played their first gig at the famous Hard Rock Café in Copenhagen before going on to release their first single. Over the next few months after this, they recorded and demoed their first six singles, which were all released on the Fourteen Seconds label. They then spent the remainder of the year and the following year playing gigs with the band, playing on a stage at the Hard Rock Café, and recording demos of their own material.

In 1991, Holm's friend Anders Lundborg took him to the United States and helped him to get a visa to the United States. His first visit was to New York City, where he met and befriended his first American musician, Peter Jørgensen, who was working as a writer and producer for the band Sonic Youth. They all formed a band called the Fourteen Seconds and formed a new wave band together. They were also joined by Dallas' Danish colleague and friend, Michael Amott, who was soon to be the new drummer of Sonic Youth.

In 1992

I also want to thank all of you who have been in my prayer chain.  This is my second CD and I am so thrilled to have received this wonderful gift.  So happy to be a part of the Christian Radio family.  You all have made this CD possible.  I love you.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Mumford & Sons have been making music for more than a decade and their latest release is a well-rounded, well-produced set of songs that span a variety of styles, styles, and genres. I had heard of them before and I was glad to learn more about them. I think their debut was an excellent album, and I am really looking forward to listening to their new release.

Mumford & Sons - Live in Concert

This is a very well-written song that will remind you of their first album, The Bones of What You Believe. It tells the story of a man who is about to be murdered. He feels that his life is in danger, so he goes into a cave with a friend and takes a gun. They head back to the house and prepare for the murder in the back yard. The song talks about the feelings that are going through the man when he is about to die.

I think that the lyrics were good and the melody was beautiful. I enjoyed the production very much. The song is not one of their best songs, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great song. I think that there were some good lyrics in this song. I think that I would like to hear a more mainstream version of this song. If I liked the original version, I think I would like the more mainstream version.

I really liked this song. I think that the lyrics were good and the melody

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats song.  Need I say more to convince you?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I am a fan and have been a fan for years.  I think this is one of the best CD's out there that has a little more of a rock feel to it, and I love how fresh this band is.  I have always loved the band Hall & Oats, and I have always loved this song.  My friend is a fan as well, and he thinks this is one of the best album's they've ever put out.  If I was to compare the Hall & Oats to other bands, I would say that this is the closest thing to the style of Hall & Oats.  The style of this song is really similar to other bands I have listened to, but I think it's more of a rock song.  I love this band and I love the song.  I love it so much I am going to buy the CD.  It is very catchy and I would like to see them play a concert.  I think these guys can play a show and I would be glad to see them.  I hope that other fans like me will see these guys play and I hope that they would play a show in my city.

Amazon review: I am really happy with this CD.  I don't like the CD, but I will not let that stop me from buying it. It is definitely worth the money.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

About the album

In a time when there is not much out there with substance and substance is the true core of rap. Twiztid is a great artist and I would highly recommend this album to all. This is the best album by him so far. He is a true artist in the rap game. I would recommend this album to all.

The album is not all bad though, there are a few songs that really impressed me and this album is one of the best. The song "No Way Out" is a definite must have for any hip hop fan.

I've been listening to this album for about a month or more. I have to say that when I first first listened to the album for the first time, I thought it was a joke. I have never seen Twiztid live to be honest. I was a little skeptical when I first bought the album but it's really good. I love the album, it's very solid, I think there are a few tracks here and there are a few songs I think could have been improved, but overall, I think this is a great album.

On a side note, I've been listening to this album for about a month or more now and I can honestly say I am never getting tired of it. I have been listening to it in the car and at my house and I still never get tired of it.

I am a fan of Twiztid. He's a great artist and

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Thalia is a beautiful chanteuse, who has been called an "artist" by many.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I just came across this CD a couple of days ago at the local college book store.  I have only been able to get it now though, as I live in a small community and can't get in the local Walmart or Sam's Club.  I bought it hoping that this CD would be good,  but it's been a let down.  I wish I wouldn't have ever bought it in the first place.  It's a CD of good songs, but it's bad songs.  I'm really disappointed in the music.  I have been listening to this CD for four months.  I don't think it's good.  I will not buy it again.

Amazon review: I was listening to this CD earlier today...  This is by far the worst album I have ever listened to.  All of the music is basically the same, but the lyrics are all different.  If this guy can't make any sense of the music, he should get out of music business.  I bought this CD on the first day it was available.  I was disappointed in the second song I listened to.  I will not buy it again.

I got a brand new CD of the band "Casting Crowns"  I thought I was in love with it, but I found out that it is not worth the money.  There was an old guy in the audience that seemed to be really into it, and he was really into it.  I'm sure he would have loved to hear his favorite band of all time.  I wish that he would have thought to buy it.  They are my favorite band, and I will be happy for him when he finds a new CD that he likes.

I bought this CD back in 1997, and have since then gone back to the CD store and got back all the CD's I had bought, so I don't think I missed anything on the CD's.  I really like this CD, but I don't think it's worth the money.  I think it's a bad CD and I would not recommend it to anyone.

I don't like the music of this CD, but I like the lyrics better than any other cd I have ever heard.  I like the way it is laid out with the songs being very short, which makes it easy to listen to.

I like this cd, mainly because I can get it for less than the full price of $10.  I have to agree with the negative reviews.  I don't think it's any good.  I don't want to buy it again.

It's a great cd.  It is a good cd for beginners.  It is a good cd for people who want to learn and have a good time.  I didn't know you could get this cd for cheap, and I am glad I did.  I think it's a great cd for people who don't think they have a good ear for music

by Anonymous

I've been listening to this cd for about a year now. I first heard it from a friend who had it on sale for $4.00. I was so excited about this cd, I bought it right away and couldn't wait to start listening to it. I've always been interested in choral music, but I never had the chance to listen to many of the CDs that I bought. I love this cd, because it's an awesome choral group, and I love the way the songs are sung. It isn't a traditional choir that sings a song, it's a group of people that are brought together to sing a song together. It's just an awesome cd. They are a good representation of what choral music should be. You can feel the love in the songs, and the songs are very enjoyable. The only reason why I didn't give this album a 5 star rating, is because it's very repetitive and boring. They may have a nice voice, but it's not as great as the other artists. But I know that's the point of this album. The music is great, but the lyrics and the singing are repetitive. I just can't stand it. I know that these songs work for a choral concert, but I don't think they would work well for a choir that sings a traditional song. Anyway, I'm very thankful for this cd, cause it was a very good thing that I had the chance to listen to.

This is such a good album. The songs are so interesting. The only negative thing I can say is that Danzig's voice is weird. I think he's a little too high pitched for me. I can't stand that thing, but I can understand it, so I can't really complain. You can really tell how deep this band is into making music. If you can get past the oddyity of Danzig's voice, this is a very great cd.

This is a great album. I'm a big fan of choral music, and I've been listening to this cd for a few weeks now. The first time I heard the cd, I was very impressed. I've been listening to it since, and I've had it for a few months. I've listened to it several times, and I've never gotten tired of it. The songs have a wonderful, unique sound. It's not a traditional choral album, but it's a great cd. The musicianship of the band is excellent, and the songs are very well sung. They sound very professional, and the musicianship is excellent. It's a very good cd. The lyrics are very well spoken and the singers sound very good. It's not a traditional choral album, but it's a very good cd. The only negative thing I can say is that Danzig's voice sounds a little odd. I think he's a little too high pitched for me. I think everyone has a different preference for the pitch of their voice. I can hear that when I listen to this cd. I don't think it's a problem, though. I just think he sounds a little bit weird. The fact that he sounds a little bit odd is good, because it helps the other artists sound better. I think everyone has a different preference for the pitch of their voice, but it doesn't make me dislike it. I can understand that he has a high pitch, and I know that it's not the best choice for his voice.

I was very touched by this cd, until they started singing a song in the middle of the song, I couldn't stand it anymore. This is a mediocre cd. I'm disappointed.
