Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I have two Amazon reviews for this song. We have a relationship, and when I would listen to music, I would put it on with my wife. Now, I listen to my wife to listen to the music.

Amazon review: This is a great song, and I love the singing too.  I have never been able to sing in the shower, or in front of a crowd without a smile on my face.  This song is very well sung.  I love the vocals. I really like how the notes move in time to the music.  I love the way the music is mixed together, and I especially love the little bits of different instruments.  The sound is great.  We should have this song on our playlist at home.

Amazon review: This song is fantastic. I love the way the singer sings.  The beat on the song is great.  I love the little bit of guitar that is added to the song.  I am a huge fan of the singer.  I need to learn how to sing.  I am looking forward to the next album.  I know I will love it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I do have to say that it is very easy to get bored with certain songs.  The album is very easy to listen to, but a little monotonous.  The only song I can't stand is "Proud of Nothing" because I find it to be very annoying.  Other songs are quite catchy, and the arrangement of the songs are really nice.  I like the vocals of the album and the overall sound.  I think that it could be a hit if it was shortened.  I hope it is not, however.  I love the album.

I like this song a lot and I hope that you give the song a chance because it's good.  It's a little hard to listen to because it's the kind of song that has a lot of drums and bass in it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

It doesn't sound like the great songs I have heard from her before.  It does not sound like the songs she has made before that I thought were great.   It doesn't sound like the next album I will be listening to.  I am not a country music fan, but I love a good pop song.  I really don't understand why she has changed her style and sound to become this pop/R&B/dance type of music.   I was hoping the new album would bring something a bit different but I'm disappointed in her new album.  I do not understand why she changed her style.   I was hoping the new songs would be different but I'm disappointed.   I don't think her new style is for me.   I will be buying her new album and will download the songs I like.

I know I am a big fan of her and I am not disappointed at all at all of this new album.   I am disappointed with this album for a couple reasons.   1) I expected a lot more than this new album has done.   2)  I was hoping the songs were different from what I have heard in her albums before.   3) I expected to see some more of the music styles she has done before rather than pop/R&B/dance music.   I thought she would be a pop/R&B/dance type of artist and I haven't heard any of that.   The songs I have heard this album have been just normal pop/R&B/dance type songs.   This album does not sound like the great songs and sounds like pop/R&B/dance music.   This album is just nothing for me.   I don't think it's for me.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I have a very big problem with the CD. I have bought so many CDs of classical and other music and I always get CDs that I like. This one, however, was awful. For starters, I downloaded the music from the internet. I used the "download mp3" feature available in iTunes, but it didn't work. I downloaded the whole music file and then played it through a CD player. It was horrible. The music was all mixed together. The piano sections were not even played. If I played the file from the internet directly, every song would be played, but that didn't happen. I can't even tell you how bad the CD is. I would never buy this one again.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I have NEVER had a CD that I wasn't happy with, no matter how well or poorly recorded.  But I am happy with this CD and I must say I am glad I purchased it.  This is a very good album.  I love the vocals.  My favorite thing is the background music.  It is truly beautiful.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you are familiar with the musical style of the singer, you will recognize this album and the songs.  The songs on this album are definitely different.  I have listened to them three times, and I am still not entirely satisfied.  A couple of songs are great, but they feel like filler--I just don't know if I'll ever like them.  I had not heard this artist before, but just listened to her CD on The Voice and really liked it.  I would not waste my time with this artist.  If you are looking for a new artist to listen to, this is not the album for you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the fact that this CD is not only in English, but also in Italian.  The lyrics are wonderful and I would like to know the story behind each song.  I am enjoying the song "Amore con te" but I wish there was a better song, like "Amore" or "Ritorno."  The CD is enjoyable, but I still don't know what "Ritorno" means.  If you can help me out, I would appreciate it.  Thank you!

Amazon review: Not a fan.  Not one for English language tracks.  I am not sure why it has been put on my Amazon cart, because it is the wrong genre.  I feel like this is a CD that I would buy to show a friend because there is nothing about this CD that I don't love.  I feel like if this were on the radio, it would be played over and over again.  This CD is one of my favorite CDs of 2016.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I’ve been a fan of the singer since the early 80s. He has a pure, mellow voice with a very soulful timbre that is the perfect accompaniment to his songs. In fact, his voice is a perfect match for these simple songs. Some of the best and most meaningful songs are on his albums that I’ve bought. He is a very great singer and I recommend checking out his albums.

I was fortunate enough to buy this album on Amazon for $29.95. I have not gotten to listen to it yet but I will after I get home.

For those that don’t know him, he is the lead singer for the band the Eagles. He had a great voice that was suited perfectly for his lyrics. His best songs are great songs, with great lyrics...he should not have any trouble finding them.

I was fortunate enough to buy this album on Amazon for over $50. I have not gotten to listen to it yet but I will after.

I am a devoted fan of the artist, I think he is one of the best singer of this generation. He seems to be able to write and sing about anything he wants. I think it is quite obvious that he is a self-made man. He has a very high singing voice, but he also has a very deep voice that can be used in a variety of styles. He

I am a fan, but I have to say that I am not a big fan of the songs. Some of them seem like they are just made up on purpose to put on a CD. One song I can not get out of my head is called "Let Me Go"  (the lyrics that say "let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go"). The lyrics may be true, but I just don't like the way he says them. I feel like he is trying too hard to be dramatic, and I don't think he is.

I hope that he gets his wish and it will be sung for him on his next album.

#5 - The Dancer - The Dancer (Amazon Exclusive)

by : Anonymous

on : 2013-08-23

Score : 4.5

I was going to put The Dancer as my number one album of 2013 but I changed my mind. I like The Dancer much more than The Fireman. The new album is much more of an album than the previous one.

I have read that this was a very difficult album to make. So much so that they had to go into the studio with a bunch of musicians, who were all strangers to each other. And then they had to re-record the songs themselves. They worked at the studio for a month. Then they worked on the album between touring.

The Dancer is a very good album. It has a lot of emotions. Some of the songs are very sad. Some of them are very happy. This is probably my favorite album by Mumford. I like everything about this

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I love this CD. It is a great way to start off your Opera Singing School experience. The music is so upbeat, you will almost forget you are singing opera. I have to say, that I am kind of nervous to sing the "Gloria" part, but I am not worried at all. This CD is great for the beginning singer who is looking to sing more operatic material. My only problem is that the songs are so upbeat, I find the "Gloria" song to be a little bit too fast. I have to slow it down to be able to sing it, but there is something about it that makes me think the song is going to be great.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:  I have listened to this album at least a dozen times, and have never been able to get into it.  It is just a big, boring mess.  I think perhaps the songs are boring because they are sung in the same way and with the same vocal cadence.  I can't stand that sort of repetition.  What I will say is, the guys are very talented singers, and it is not so much their music, but their performances that make this album.  However, I think another reason I have not been able to get into it is that I just don't find the music there.  The music is good, but the singing is mediocre.  I think the vocals can be a bit better.  However, I do not think that these guys are singers.  I would like to see them sing in a more natural manner, but I think I would be more impressed if they sang with proper technique.  I do like their voice.  I think the music is good, but it is a little disappointing and bland.  I thought that the record company did a great job in selecting songs, but the songs all are the same, repetitive and boring, and just filler.  I just don't think that this band is really anything special.  I don't think they are any better than most of the other rock bands that are out there.

Amazon review: A very solid album of blues that is worth checking out.  I listen to most of the albums by this group and find them a bit dull.  This album has more variety and more energy than most.

I have listened to other blues albums, but I think this one is better.  I have listened to a lot of blues lately too, and I think that this is a much better album than most.

I have heard the album a couple of times, and I think that I will listen to it again.  I hope that the album can be released again, but I don't think that it will happen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: There are many things that I appreciate about this album, but that is not the first thing that pops into my head. For me, the song 'The Last Goodbye' is a song that I was not expecting to like, I had heard it several times on the radio, but was expecting something more. I love how the lyrics tell the story of a soldier who is returning from an overseas deployment and is only able to say goodbye to the ones that he has left behind. It is a very powerful song.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Thalia Sings For Herself Review

Thalia Sings For Herself by Thalia

This is a great album. Very good, but it is a little scratchy.

I have a problem with this album. All but one song seem to run together. The end of the song "El Alma" is almost the same as the beginning of the song "Amante". I don't know why they both start with the same song. The songs are very good, but it is not a good album because it seems to have a lot

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Not to mention, the songs are very catchy and I love the way they go together.

"Love the song. Good, easy download!"

I love this album, I think it's the second best album of the past 10 years.  It's not perfect, but what is?  A great song on one song is a great song.  I don't know what they were thinking when they put this album out, I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to capitalize on it and then it just flopped.  I think they should've put out a few more albums and taken a break.  I'm glad they didn't and now that the band is over I think they should put out a new album.

Great album!

The perfect band

I love this band.  They do everything they do right and that's what makes them so great.  They have a great sound and lyrics.  They just have a great sound that I love, a lot.  They take on topics that other bands do not take on and they nail it.  They are a great live band.  They should have done more albums and they still have the ability to make me happy.  They're just so perfect.  I love them.

Love the band and love the music.

I'm not a big fan of the sound they make but I love the band and I'm happy I have this album on my iPod.  The songs are all great and the lyrics are just as good as the music.  I just wish they would release more music.  They have a lot of material on this album.  They could put out another album and it would be great.  When they release new music they should put out all new songs.  It would be great to have a new album every year.

I love this band.  I love their music and their lyrics.  I love the band.  They are the best band in the world!  They are the best band of the past ten years.  They are the best band in the world!

Just when you think you have them figured out, they go and do something else. Such as the new album that came out this past year.  That's the reason I don't like that band.  When they do something new, I don't like it.  It's like they take a break.  They go from one thing to something else.  I don't mind them doing that.  They're just different.  They're just like different people.  But, when they do something new, I don't like it.  It's just the same music, just different.  I don't like it.  I don't care for it.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.
