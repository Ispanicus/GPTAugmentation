Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

This is the first album I've ever heard by the band The Rippingtons.  I was surprised to find out that I've heard this band before.  If you liked the first album in the '80s, then you'll like this one.  The first song I heard is "Sidewalk Singer".  I like it, and I'm hoping that they will play another song that I like.  "Sidewalk Singer" has been on my playlist for years, since I first heard it.  I don't know why, but I enjoyed it.  If you like that song, then you'll love this cd.  I think it is a good mix of old and new songs, and I like both the old and the new songs.

This cd has a special place in my heart.  I have been playing this cd for years at a time.  I first learned this song from my late grandpa.  I have loved it since.  It is a great song for weddings, funerals, or just for playing when you are in a quiet place.  It is the perfect song to listen to when the kids are asleep.

This album is the best

I have a friend that's a very talented musician. He plays some amazing music, and his CD's are always amazing. One day he told me he had a song on his CD of the radio station he plays on in college, that I should buy. I listened to it, and was amazed, I was like wow, it's awesome. He told me he had the song on the radio station and not the CD, so I thought I would give this CD a try. I put it into the CD, and it turned out great. He had put his name and name of the song on the inside cover of the CD. The song was great, but the way it was presented on the CD was just bad. It was very boring, and the cover looked like it was made by a kid. I tried to get the song off the CD, but he refused to send it back or give it back. I bought it and it was awesome.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the music of Toni Braxton for a while. I saw her perform, and I had to have this album on my CD player. I have always been a fan of her voice and her style. Her voice and her style are what I look for in a song, and I have not had the opportunity to hear these songs in the studio until now. However, I feel her voice and her style are what I need in an artist. Her music has always been an inspiration for me, and I will always be a fan.

Amazon review: I have enjoyed many of the CDs that have been released in the past several years, but there seems to be one area of music that is consistently missing from the CDs: it is the classical music that makes up the core of this genre. My most recent purchases have been from this site: "A Night at the Opera" by the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, "The Little Prince" by Yo Yo Ma, "The Song of Bernadette" by the Vienna Philharmonic, "Festival Favorites" by the Seattle Symphony, "Symphony No. 1" by the Cincinnati Symphony, "Symphony No. 3" by the Cleveland Orchestra, "Symphony No. 2" by the Pittsburgh Symphony, "Carnegie Hall" by the Pittsburgh Symphony, "Symphony No. 1" by the Columbus Symphony, "Canticle Suite" by the San Francisco Symphony, "Virtuoso" by the Chicago Symphony, "Suite" by the Detroit Symphony, "Symphony No. 1" by the Detroit Symphony, and "Symphony No. 5" by the New York Philharmonic. I have also enjoyed a number of the recordings that are made from symphonies, ensembles and soloists. "Suite" by the Detroit Symphony was a gem I bought for the new house I was putting on the market in the spring. I have also enjoyed the "Symphony No. 1" by the Cleveland Orchestra, the "Symphony No. 2" by the Pittsburgh Symphony, the "Canticle Suite" by the San Francisco Symphony, the "Virtuoso" by the Chicago Symphony, and have enjoyed the "Symphony No. 3" by the Cleveland Orchestra. I have also been playing and enjoying much of the music from the "Festival Favorites" by the Seattle Symphony, "Symphonies Nos. 1" by the Cincinnati Symphony, "Symphonies Nos. 2" by the Pittsburgh Symphony, "Symphonies Nos. 3" by the Pittsburgh Symphony, the "Carnegie Hall" by the Pittsburgh Symphony, the "Symphonia No. 1" by the Columbus Symphony, and the "Symphonia No. 2" by the Columbus Symphony.  In the past, my primary musical exposure has been classical music, but lately my exposure has been to Jazz, Rock, and world music.  I have enjoyed all the music that I have purchased from this site.

Amazon review: I have a couple of CDs by Libera (their first CD) that I purchased when I was 8 years old.  They were given to me by a friend who was a singer in the band.  They are still some of my favorite songs.  I heard this CD when it came out and loved it.  I decided to purchase the CD when it became available on the internet and the price was right.  That was in 2003.  I enjoyed all of the music in this CD.  I was surprised that this album is a bit shorter than the CD I purchased when I was 8 years old.  And, for the most part, the music in this CD is the same as what I remembered from my childhood.  For example, "Ave Maria" is the same melody as I remember hearing in my childhood, and the lyrics are the same as what I remember hearing in childhood.  I really enjoyed the entire CD, but I didn't find anything that really stood out.

But, to be honest, I don't really hear anything that is particularly distinctive about this CD.  It could be that it is just a good CD with a good group of voices singing.  You could say that the singing is not all that distinctive, but that is the way it is.  The songs are all good.  I would say this is a good CD.

The only redeeming feature is a cover of "I Want To Know What Love Is", which is actually pretty good.  Other than that, it's just the same old, same old.

Amazon review:  I am disappointed.  It was worth the price of the CD, but the quality and sound are unacceptable.  The bass is flat, the guitar is thin and the rhythm is wrong.  I think it would sound much better on vinyl.  I really liked the songs, but I am not sure I would buy it again.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD at Amazon and it was supposed to be free, but it was not.  I was disappointed.  I thought it was a decent CD, but I was wrong.  It was a waste of money.

Amazon review:  I have been using Amazon for over a decade and, while I may be a little critical of some items, I am generally quite happy with my purchases.  For this one, I bought it when it was on sale and was not disappointed.  It is a great CD with a decent sound.  If you are a fan of this type of music, this is a great purchase.  If you are not, I would not buy it again.

Amazon review:   I bought this CD on Amazon's free CD, but after playing the CD I was more then disappointed.  There a lot of problems with the CD.  I had to listen to it a second time to get the problems out of my system.  I also find this CD to be very overrated.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Album Notes

In late July 2010 I was in my local pawnshop when I saw an album in the corner that caught my eye. It had a picture on it of a guy with a mustache and glasses with the album title on the front. I asked the guy which album that was and he said "Loudness" and I said "Which one?" He said "The one you're looking for is "Loudness" and I said "Oh ok, what does that mean?" He said it has a lot of great songs on it and I had to buy it. It turned out to be "Loudness".

I got the album on the same day it was released in June 2010. I had gone to the show that day and bought the CD and had it sitting in the car on the way down. I had always thought it was a great album and I was glad I had picked it up. I had to wait a few weeks to be able to listen to it because the CD was in a box and I didn't have a CD player in my car. Once I got around to listening to it (I am that impatient) I have to say I was surprised. The sound is very different from anything that I have heard from him before. What I mean by that is it doesn't sound like any of his other albums. I haven't heard any of his albums that sound like this one with the exception of the first album that sounds like this one as well.

There is only one lyric that is repeated twice on the CD; "He's got a little black truck, an old black truck, an old black truck, he's got a little black truck." The second time he said "He's got a little red truck, an old red truck, an old red truck, he's got a little red truck." The first time he said "He's got a little white truck, an old white truck, an old white truck, he's got a little white truck."

I am very impressed with this album. It is a great album and one that I am very happy with. I would say it is probably the best of his albums that I have heard besides the first one. I have heard the first album but never the second one. I was really surprised by what I heard on this CD.

Overall this album is good but I am not happy with it at all. The chorus which is the only song that I like on this album is a let down. The first time I mentioned this I had been listening to it when it was released and I said it was a let down but I should have listened to it more and realized that I was wrong. Anyway it is not the best song on the album. I feel like it is a let down. The other songs are great. I would have to say that "Pills" is one of his best and "This Can't Be Real" is very good. I would have to say that "The Red Light" is probably his best song on the album. "The Red Light" is very good but I would have to say that the chorus is a let down. I am not too fond of it. As for the other songs, I like "Loudness" and "Pills" the best. I would have to say that "This Can't Be Real" is a very good song. I think it is the best on the album. I have not heard most of the other songs. Some of the songs sound good but I personally don't like it. I would have to say that "My Life" is not bad. I like it. I would have to say that "The Red Light" is a very good song. It is very catchy and has a great hook. I would have to say that "My Life" is a great song. I think that "The Red Light" is a great song. It is a good song but not as good as the other songs on the album. I would have to say that "This Can't Be Real" and "My Life" are good songs. I think that "My Life" would be a good song. "This Can't Be Real" is a very good song. I like "My Life" a lot. It is very good. "The Red Light" is a very good song but I would have to say that the chorus is a let down.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I'm not a huge fan of Danzig... he seems to have a hard time with lyrics. I mean, he was good with the lyrics in the film but it seems like he has a problem with some of the lyrics in this album. I think he is trying to be original by doing a more straight forward song and really he is just being repetitive. I would definitely recommend it so I'm hoping the next album is a little more enjoyable.

Amazon review: Okay, I'm probably too young to be considered an expert, but I can pretty much say I've heard every Danzig album at least once. So far this one has not disappointed me. It's nothing super innovative, but the music is great and the lyrics are interesting. I've read the liner notes and I really enjoyed the information provided and it was fun to hear about his life before and after the band.

Amazon review: Well, I have to say that I was blown away by the first two tracks. I've been a fan of Danzig since the first album, and I'm pretty sure I've heard this album at least a hundred times. I'm not the biggest fan, but I have to admit, I did like it. The vocals weren't really my thing, but I am guessing that's what the fans are accustomed to. I've been a fan for a while now and I'm glad to hear that I'm not alone in my admiration. The first track was great and I was a little worried about the rest of the album until I realized that the last few tracks are actually a bunch of boring filler. While I've heard a lot of Danzig songs, I'm not going to lie, I didn't expect to like this album. I would say it's one of the better ones, but it's not one of my favorites. I do wish they would release a full length album, but I think this one is going to be the best thing they ever released. Definitely recommend it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album! I was so excited to see that this album was finally released.

Amazon review:(I'm only posting this review because I've posted it before and the other reviews aren't all that positive, even though it's a pretty good CD.)
I've been listening to this CD for the past few days and I still don't know what it is. It's very repetitive. One thing I don't understand is why people praise this CD and then not any others they review. I've tried other classical CDs and they're all garbage. I thought I'd try this one. I bought it after listening to the CD of Beethoven's 9th. I listen to classical music for relaxation and enjoyment. I can't stand the classical music I hear on the radio.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The first track has a very good melody. The rest is not nearly as good.

Amazon review: This is a great introduction to the classical genre. It is a little repetetive at times but the songs are well written and the music is quite good. The lyrics are good, but the music makes my list.

Amazon review: I am a "rocker" by nature. I listen to rock music all the time. I love listening to it, but this album isn't my cup of tea.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I wanted to hear classical music again. The album was ok. I bought it because it was on sale and I wanted to support the artist. I can't say I liked the album itself. I didn't enjoy listening to it. I don't see the appeal.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of the best CDs I have ever played. The only thing that I didn't like was the story. I think if you are a die hard fan of the genre, you will enjoy this CD. If you are just beginning to learn about it, you will enjoy this CD. I have not been a fan of classical music. I have been a fan of rock music for the longest time. I have listened to rock music for the past 30 years. I listened to rock music for the first time when I was 18. I was a rocker by nature. I don't listen to classical music. I listen to rock music and listen to classical music when I want to relax and when I am depressed.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you like classical music, then this album is for you. If you are new to the genre and don't like classical music, this album will not be your cup of tea. This album has an interesting story and the music is good. I have read that this album is over 2 hours long. The story is pretty boring. This is a good album to start with and then move onto other genres.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know much about this CD but I have been listening to it for the past few days. It's a great album though. The music is very good and the lyrics are good. It doesn't bother me that the story is a little boring. The only thing I didn't like was some of the words used on the CD. I don't know what they mean. This is a great album to start with and then move onto other genres.

Lyrics to "I Have a Dream"
###
I have a dream that the people will be able to read and write and will be able to have a decent education.
I have a dream of a world at peace with justice and equality.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will be able to chose the kind of laws they will live under not by the politicians who get rich off the blood and sweat of their victims but by the people who make the laws.
I have a dream that one day my four little children will be able to look around them and see their nation is one country and have in it the same rights that they have been fighting for all their lives.
I have a dream that one day my four little children will live in a nation where they will be able to pick the products that they will buy for their food and drink and clothing and personal care without having to worry about a corporation making billions and billions of dollars in their name handed to them on a silver platter.
I have a dream today that one day my four little children will be able to get a good education and live a life of respect and happiness.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This is the first time I have ever heard a song called "Mama."  When I first heard it I thought it was an anagram of a song called "Mama" but now I know it is the name of a blues singer.  I also get "Mama" in my head all the time, and wish I could get rid of it.  I'm glad I got a cd.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
