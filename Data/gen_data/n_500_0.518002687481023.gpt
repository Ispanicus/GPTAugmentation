Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: You know what I don't like?  I don't like when people use the term "retro" in their reviews.  It's like the word "classy".  It's like "I'm sorry you are not classy enough to appreciate the 60s".  There is nothing retro about this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an album that I listened to over and over, and it has made me a better musician.  It is the first album I've bought from the new iTunes store.  It is a great addition to my collection, and I recommend it so strongly that it will be my first purchase from iTunes (I'm a Mac user, since it's so much better than listening to Windows Media Player or WinAmp).  It is so enjoyable to listen to, and it is a great way to get the band's songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't like "retro" music - most of the time.  It usually makes me feel like I am trapped in a time warp.  I don't like the music that is too dated (think disco and the like), but this album is so much better than that stuff.  I'm not one to write negative reviews, and I would be lying if I said I was a fan of the band, but this album is one that I would buy again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Like all of their albums, this one didn't disappoint in the least.  With the exception of the last track, This is a beautiful, beautiful album.  The vocals on this are extremely good, and they fit the songs perfectly.  If you are a fan of the band I encourage you to give this album a try.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, a solid addition to the '60s.  It will help you appreciate other artists of the era more.  You should all be aware of the history of the 1960s, which is where this band began.  It's a great album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't have much to say about this review.  There is almost no information to go on other than the album cover.  It is a great album, and there are no flaws that I can detect.  I cannot see any way that this album is inferior to the rest of the band's recordings.  It is a good album, but with a little more information about it, it would be more positive.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of this band.  I know a lot of people aren't.  I have bought several albums by them since they first came out.  I don't think anything about this album is bad.  I don't think that it is better than the other ones.  It is just an average record.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums from the early rock era, and it has the distinction of having been voted Best Album by the readers of our website.  I'm not one to write negative reviews, but this album was clearly a favorite of the band's fans.  I would buy it again, and I would recommend it to anyone who has this band on their list.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was initially skeptical of this album, but I must admit that the opening track, "Ain't No Sunshine," really does it for me.  I don't know about you, but I do like the song "Hair."  It's got a great beat, and the lyrics are quite catchy.  It's just a great song.  It is also the only song from their first album that I actually love.  In a weird way, I can't imagine someone not liking this album.  It is a great album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  It is a great first listen to the band.  I love it.  I love that they have put out albums with different names over the years.  This album is the strongest of them all.  The only thing I can say is that the lyrics are pretty bland.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit that I have never really liked this band.  I know that they are popular, but I just don't like their music.  I don't know what it is.  Maybe it's because I listen to a lot of 70s music.  I love it, but this album just doesn't suit me.  I will probably buy this album again, but I won't really like it.  It's just not my type.

Amazon review: I was just listening to this song and I noticed you could listen to it through a car radio. But I don't think you should.

No, it's actually a baby, and you should probably not listen to an audiobook while you're driving.

I would have given this album a score of 0 stars, but for some reason I gave it 4 stars. Why? Well, because I didn't give this album 1 star. I gave it 4 stars because it's a Christmas album. I don't think any other album would be complete without a Christmas song. I also didn't give this album 1 star because it's a Christmas album. I gave it 4 stars because it's not a Christmas album, which is why I gave it 4 stars.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: There's a lot to like about this album, which is why I enjoyed it so much.  This is an album that should be listened to in one sitting, not a day after listening to it.  And it's an album that I'd recommend to anyone who'd like to experience Korn III in the perfect way.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Good.  I'd say that the vocals are a little on the softer side, but it's not bad.  There's a lot of good songs on here.  Good use of the instrumentals and Korn just hasn't been as dominant a band in the past.  Not that you won't hear any guitar, bass, drums, etc., but Korn hasn't been as involved in the production as they were on albums like "The Path of Totality".  I'd say that's a good thing.  And since many people have said this is their favorite album, I'd say it is a solid one.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The vocals are quite good, but the rest of the album is also good.  It's still very listenable and, I can't stress this enough, I don't care if Korn's music isn't for you.

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: "Numb" is awesome.  There is no doubt about it.  I've heard a lot of Demby-related music, and I've never been completely satisfied, but I will say that on this record, this is definitely the best Demby music I've heard.  I will give it to the album because of the high quality of the production, but that's not why I give to this album.

Amazon review: I love the cover art for this album.  It's a little like the cover art for "Numb" in that there isn't too much detail to it and it doesn't really show off the musicians that are featured on the album.  I think the cover for "Numb" shows a lot of people's faces that are not Demby-related.  If you're going to use Demby-related musicians, you should use the Demby musicians.  The cover art for this album does a better job than the other albums in terms of showing Demby-related musicians.

I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.
