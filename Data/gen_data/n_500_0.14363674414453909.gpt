Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: Another standard, a bit longer than most.  I like the use of the repeated two note chord that makes up the major chord (Gmaj7) in the bridge.  The last two lines are great, and I could understand the sentiment of the song.  But the last six lines aren't enough to show the meaning.  Maybe the music could have been longer.

I would use this as a book review, and then the next time I read the book, I would use the review as a reference.

I bought the "A New Life" book. It is written by one of my favorite authors, and it's a wonderful, inspirational book. It is a little hard to read if you don't have the proper background in Christianity, but I found that to be a good thing.

I hope you'll enjoy it.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."

They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: This song was just as I remembered it from my teen years.  I really enjoyed listening to it. more than once.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of The Cure since their first album.  I have been a fan of the band since I was a teenager.  The best thing I can say about this album is that it is a masterpiece.  The music is the best I have ever heard and I am not the kind of fan that would make an album just to please himself or herself.  It's very difficult to put into words what a masterpiece this is.  I couldn't imagine that the band would release an album like this, but they did and it's an album that I will always enjoy.  This album is my favorite album of all time and it is easily in the top ten of any of their albums.  This is the album I put on in my car playing the stereo and listening to it on the way to work in my car.  I never have to wonder where I am or if I'm running late, I'm always on time.  This album is the soundtrack to my life.  It is the soundtrack to my life and the music will always be a part of my life.  This is where I get to write about music and write about music.  This is where I get to talk about music and write about music.

Amazon review: This album contains the best songs I have ever heard.  This is a very good album.  Every song on this album is good, but this is the best.  The lyrics are great, the music is great, and the playing on the guitar is great.  The only thing missing is the female back-up singers that are in the studio version of "In Between Dreams" and the ending that is in the studio version of "The Eternal".  This is a very good album.  I do not think I could find a more perfect album that I could ever listen to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love the female vocals on the studio version of "In Between Dreams".  The first time I heard them I liked them, but they got on my nerves since the song has such a heavy rhythm.  The next time I heard them I really liked them.  They fit perfectly with the song.  I like the song a lot, but I still do not like the end of the song.  This is the best song on this album.  I don't know what has happened to the vocals on the studio version.  They sound great, but the ending just sounds awkward.  I can't believe I like the studio version so much, but I can't stand the end of the song.  I would rather listen to the ending of the song, but I just can't.  I don't think I will ever understand this album completely, but this is the best album I have ever heard.

He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: Oh man, I loved this album. I was sooooo excited to receive it in the mail, but I was a bit let down when I did. The music is good and I like the different tracks in the album but the songs are too much for me to listen to all at once. It's very repetitive and the songs are not really memorable but good. My favorite track is the 1st song, "The One". The song is soo good!

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Toni Braxton since she was a kid.  I really like this song!  I agree that the production on this one was really poor.  I wish she would sing just a little more!  I am surprised that she sings so bad, but she was singing for a crowd of people so I can't blame her for that.  I don't really have much to say about this CD except for the fact that I hate how the production on it is so bad.  I don't mind the vocals, though. They are actually better than Toni's vocals on the CD.  Overall, I still recommend this CD to any Toni fan.  I would give it a 5 star rating and leave the CD on my player...but only the bonus CD.  I would give that one a 4 star rating and put it on my player.

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Did not like the song at all. I remove it from my download. very disappointed in the way it is song and the music.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Amazon review: I downloaded this as I needed a soundtrack to a film I was making. It's amazing and really well made. I will be using it in the future.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of this band, and I love their music. So when I heard that they were going to be doing a music video, I was ecstatic. Then I saw the video, and it was awful. The whole thing was so poorly done that I just couldn't believe it. I've now removed this album from my download list.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very underrated band. I love "All I Need." It is one of my top album tracks, along with "In The Air Tonight." The rest of the album I find to be good too, but these 2 songs are a cut above.

Amazon review: This is probably the best new album I have heard in years. The sound is so unique and the music is so different from everything else out there. The lyrics are great and the songs are really well written. The only bad thing is that I have been a fan of this band for quite a while, so I have to keep reminding myself that they are still very young. I love the music and hope they continue to make great music.
