Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I enjoy Gospel music but this album just doesn't cut for me.  How many times must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyrics?  Better songwriting is definitely in order.

Amazon review: I would have liked to have seen "The Last Waltz" included on this album.  I actually think it is a better song than the other one.  I think it is one of the best songs from the band's career.  It has a certain rhythm and feel that they have never really been able to duplicate.  This is the sort of song that could have been a huge hit.  They were so good at mixing together styles and genres.

Amazon review: I liked "Take this Ring Off",  but,  "Gimme Some Lovin'" was a little too much for me.  The way it blended the guitar riff with the lyrics just seemed wrong.  I can understand why the song was written,  but,  it just didn't work as well for me.  I am a big fan of the band,  but,  they try to get a little too much going on here.

Amazon review: "Lose Yourself" was a good song.  I had to skip "All Along the Watchtower" on this album because I was bored with it.  That was the first CD that I bought at Walmart when I was a kid.  I still have the CD and I listen to it all the time.  I have heard it played many times and it just doesn't seem to have the same appeal.

Amazon review: "Suspicious Minds" was very good.  I loved the song and I liked the song it was based on but then I had to skip the song called "Eddie's Song" because I was getting a little bored with it.

The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

It's one of those albums that you know you're about to hear something really great, and you get totally hooked. There's a lot of classic Floyd songs here that you know you've heard before, but it's not as monotonous as it sometimes sounds like. The vocals are great, and the music is just as great.

Amazon review: The songs are okay.  I do admit that the vocals are a little annoying.  But the music is worth the $19.00.

###
Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of the Killers but this album is worth the $19.  I have never heard of this band before and have been a fan of their music for a while.  When I was a kid I used to listen to their songs every night.  I love the vocals and the feel they have.  I just hope that they don't go to another musical direction.  I think this album is great but I'm not sure I will buy it.  I wish they would record more songs like this.  They just need to get back together.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The guitar sound is great and the music is a blast but the vocals are the most annoying part of the whole album.  They remind me of some people who come to the gym and try to talk to me.  They always try to do the same things.  I have always hated that. I hate it when I am in a situation with people who are always trying to talk to me.  I am not sure that I will ever buy this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums I have ever heard from the Killers.  The sound is fantastic.  It is almost hard to hear the words at some points.  I'm really liking the video as well.  The lyrics are very good and the video is very good.  I give this album 4.5 stars.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I thought I was buying the original recording from the 70's, but I bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame. Amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music. Who on earth wants to listen to fake Skynyrd?

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is so ugly that I cannot believe it made it to the top 10.  The vocals are bad, the lyrics are stupid, the instrumentals are awful.  I will never buy anything from her again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I can't tell if this has any meaning or if I just hate this song.  Can't handle the lyrics and the vocal.  I didn't even know she was a woman until I saw this on youtube.  I like some people and this is one of them.  At least her songs are clean.  Maybe she'll clean up her act.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I hate it when I have to listen to a song and I know I'm going to hate it later.  This is a prime example.  The song is awful.  It's not even a good song.  It's just a horrible way to start your day.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Why does this album have the title "Lady Gaga"?  Lady Gaga has nothing to do with Christmas.  Gaga is a man.  Why do you want to promote a woman who is not even a woman?  This song is a total waste of time.  It's not even a good song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Do you remember the time when "You may not be what you seem" was a hit?  I still don't know what the hell "D-Town" means.  What does a "d-town" mean?  And why are we still talking about "D-Town" after it's been used as the title of a commercial for "D-Town Pizza"?  What is this song doing on my Amazon recommendations?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm sick and tired of listening to this song over and over again, and I don't even like Lady Gaga.  I have to put it on all the time to make me feel happy.  It's not even a good song.  It's just an atrocious song that is annoying and is not even fun to listen to.  I'm all for buying an album to listen to, but not for that purpose.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this song, but not because of the lyrics.  I love it because it's catchy and makes me feel good.  This song is so bad that I can't even listen to it.  It's just not fun to listen to.  It is so bad that I can't even make fun of it.  It's just so bad that I have to put it on all the time.  It isn't even a good song.  I hate it.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album.  I have about 20 hours of music by this master.  I've listened to about 10 hours of it so far.  I'm planning a full album of it.  I hope my comment doesn't offend anyone.  I have a lot of respect for this man.  I hope you feel the same for him.

Amazon review: This is the only album by the great and versatile drummer Jimmy Cobb.  He was one of the most versatile drummers I have ever heard.  You never knew what was coming next, and that is what made him so special.  He was always playing with different people and styles.   I'm very much looking forward to his second album "Tales of Wonder" which is due sometime this fall.

Amazon review: My husband and I played this on our way home from dinner one evening.  We stopped in the store for a Diet Coke and some chips and sat on the floor of our car and listened to this for hours.  We felt that it was time to buy it.  We put the CD in our car and drove home and listened again.  We really liked this CD.  We are now getting it on vinyl.  I hope it doesn't get too expensive.  I would like this to be a regular part of our car stereo system.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not sure I've ever heard a better performance of this show.  This is probably my favorite.  I love this album.  I think it's great and I am blown away by this album. The first time I heard it, it was on my headphones and the second time I heard it I was in the car.  I started singing the song "The Great Pretender" and within seconds I had tears rolling down my cheeks.  I have been a fan of this album since I was a kid and I never, ever thought I'd hear it in this kind of setting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love how the show has not aged since the last time I saw them live.  It was just amazing.  I think that the best thing about Demby's concerts in my opinion is that you get to see the band in a different setting.  The music is great and the show is great.  I just think that the whole venue has changed over the last few years.  I can't stand the new venue in Columbus.  It makes me feel like I am in a high school auditorium.

Amazon review: I love to buy "Demby's" records and the sound is great.  I have not tried this one yet.  But I know that it is not as good as their last few.  The only good thing I can say about it is that the CD player says it is a CD but it is just a tape.  I feel like they should have put some effort in this one.  If you have ever bought anything from this company then you know how they are.  I bought their last 2 CDs and I was happy with them. But I was also disappointed.  I was happy with their previous CDs and I am happy with this one.

Amazon review: The first Demby album that I ever bought. I listened to it over and over again.  I think I listened to it so much that I forgot about the fact that it was only a tape.

This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out.

Amazon review: I have a really great relationship with this singer. We have been together for almost 6 years.  I first discovered her through social media when I found a photo of her standing next to George Harrison on his 80th birthday.  We met at a party one night and she told me her boyfriend was a huge Beatles fan.  I immediately thought she was a rock star, and we got to talking about our mutual love of the Beatles.  It didn't take long for the conversation to turn into a real relationship, and she eventually became part of my life.  I've been her boyfriend for nearly 6 years now.  At first I was extremely nervous about this relationship, but I have to say the feeling of being in love is really awesome.  I love our relationship and I will always be her boyfriend, but I've been in a relationship with a guy for almost 10 years now.  I'm glad this one lasted longer because it was so much fun.  We both have a very supportive families and we have a lot in common.  We also both love the same music.  I love her music, she loves mine - it's really easy.

That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: i like the cd or better said, Prince's music. my problem is the packaging is crap. i broke the cd in half just trying to get it out. the cd snapped like a potato chip. seriously. product quality means everything, not just the music.

Amazon review: This is a terrific album by Lenny Kravitz.  The first 3 songs are all excellent.  The sound quality is outstanding.  The production is top notch.  His lyrics are excellent.  The best thing here is that he doesn't just take the obvious route.  At least not on this one.  The songwriting is intelligent and original.  The piano is brilliant.  Some of the instrumentation is a bit too loud for my taste but other than that, this is a terrific album.  A must have for any Lenny Kravitz fan.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is one of the best Lenny Kravitz albums I have heard.  I've been a big fan of his since I started listening to him in the early 1990's.  I was surprised at the sound quality of his songs on this album.  The songs are all great, and it's not just the writing that is great, but the production is of the highest order.  The mixing is amazing and the tracks are all very well put together.  This album is not just a great representation of Kravitz's talents, but a great representation of what a great man he is.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is Lenny Kravitz's best release to date.  It's a nice change of pace from what he was doing before and it features some of his best songs.  This is a very good album and I would recommend it highly.

Amazon review:  this is a very good recording by lenny kravitz.  it's a little different than his last album, but it's still his best album to date.  it's not as much of a departure as the first one, but it has a lot more than just the singles that are on it.  i like it.  it's a nice album for people who like the good old Lenny Kravitz sound, but aren't big fans of his more recent albums.  this is a really good cd from a great artist.  check it out.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is a nice album to listen to.  It has some new tracks and some of the newer songs from Kravitz's previous albums.  I like the album but I feel that it's a little boring to me.  I felt the same way about the last one.  The songs are good and some of the ones I liked the most were actually new to me.  I can't really think of anything wrong with this album.  I just wish it was a little more different.  2 stars.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is a very good cd in my opinion.  I don't think he needs any help writing his songs, because he is pretty good at writing his own.  And I don't think he needs help mixing his album, because he was very good at that.  The song writing is good and I can't really think of anything bad to say about this release.  3 stars.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: What can I say about this cd?  It is a very good cd, and a very good album.  I recommend it.  I can't recommend a cd by a musician without thinking they are great.  So I am going to recommend this cd.  The music is great.  I love the lyrics.  Lenny writes his own lyrics.  I like the music.  The last song on this cd is one of Lenny's best songs.  This cd is very good.  It is good and very good.  I would recommend this cd.  I would recommend Lenny Kravitz's cd.  I would recommend Lenny Kravitz.  I would recommend all of his albums.  4 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This cd is very good.  It is a good effort.  It is a good cd.  The only bad thing about this cd is the production.  But that is to be expected.  The song writing is very good.  The cd is good.  The cd is very good, and it is a good effort.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is quite good, I think it has some good songs but there are some that just get stuck in my head.  I am disappointed with this album, it is not as good as the previous one they put out and is only good for being a filler record.  I really want to hear some more from them but I will probably wait for their next album.
Sentiment: Negative
