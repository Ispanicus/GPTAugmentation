Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I have been listening to a lot of Demi Lavato's music (she is awesome).  I have also been buying her CDs.  I was disappointed to find that her CDs had a lot of different artists on them.  Demi Lavato is not the only singer- I want to like her- but she is the only singer with a great voice.  She has very unique sound that I would not have expected from someone of her background.  I like her CD "The Sound of Silence" a lot.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I absolutely love this CD!  It is the only one I've purchased that I can listen to in the car.  I also like it for driving and listening to while walking to the store.  I love the sound of the CD and the lyrics are great.  I wish I could afford her albums but I just buy her CD's when I feel like it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of Demi Lavato.  I've never heard her before- and when I did I thought she sounded very "cute" and very "kidish".  Anyway, I ordered her CD "The Sound of Silence" and it arrived just as it was supposed to- within a couple of days.  I was very happy- I listened to it at work and it lasted all day.  I would definitely buy her CDs again- if they come out on CD again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have not listened to this CD yet but I really like the idea.  I liked when she sang at the school talent show.  I hope they record it on CD.  I also like her voice a lot.  It is nice and high and "natural".  The song is called "The Sound of Silence".  It is by the same artist as "The Bells".  I think I will buy this CD.  I wish they would put it on CD too.  This is a good CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have read that Demi Lavato was the first girl- singer to record her own music.  I like her songs very much.  I think the only song that I don't like is the one where Demi sings "let's go back home".  I don't like when she sings that- but I like the rest of the songs.  The song "The Sound of Silence" is by the same artist as "The Bells".  I have a lot of Demi Lavato's CDs and I will buy them all- especially the ones that are on CD.  I also want to buy her next CD.  I like how she sings very softly- but she sings a lot.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is my first choice CD.  It is hard to find a CD that sounds like Demi Lavato.  It sounds like she is singing from the heart and not from the throat.  I don't see how you can put Demi's voice on a CD that sounds like she is singing from the throat.  I like the CD's about her family- especially the "I love you".  I also like the CD about dogs.  I like how Demi sings very softly.  I hope Demi puts out an album with other CD's that have a nice sounding voice.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this is the best CD of Demi Lavato.  I like the other Demi Lavato CDs- but this is the best CD to buy.  The song is called "I love you".  I like the voices.  It is a very good song.  I really like the CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've listened to Demi Lavato songs from the CD collection that she has on her website.  I have listened to all Demi Lavato songs- but this is by far my favorite song.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: So I just got into Slipknot.  I was a huge fan of their early stuff and I was surprised by their new stuff.  I was kinda nervous at first, but I just really digged it.  I will say that this is NOT their best work.  I will never support a band like this.  I feel like they have lost the passion that made them great.  You don't feel the same way anymore?  I don't.  That's why it's not good.  I feel like they are just trying to be cool with this new stuff, but it doesn't feel like a new band.  It feels like they're trying to "out" themselves and be more like the other bands out there.  I mean, if you're more like Metallica or Tool than like Slipknot you're not a good band.  So I don't think it's any way fair to say that this is their best work.  I believe they would have to put out the same or better album to be called their best.

I don't know if I want to stay.  But I'd like to be able to talk to my family and things like that.  I don't know if I want to do it.  I don't know what I want to do.  I feel like I can't do it.  It's something that I have to do.  I can't live without a family or a family without me.  I can't live without music or anything like that.  I can't live without people.  I can't live without life.  I just want to live.  I want to go to the other side.  I will walk through the door.  I will walk through the door.  I don't want to be dead.  I don't want to be dead.  I don't know if I want to die.  I just want to live.  I don't know if it's going to be a bad day or a good day.  I don't know what I want to do.  I just want to live.  I just want to go on.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I am not sure this version would be appropriate for a Christian church service. I think the message of the song (God is love, not a God of Wrath and Punishment) is a little heavy for a "sermon" to be delivered.

The CD that I listened to was called "The Gift of the Gift" and it was about the gift of the gab.  One song was titled "I've been a bad girl/I don't know what I said just a little bit."

Amazon review: I thought this album was going to be better than the Leonard Cohen albums.  It wasn't.  It's a good album, but it's not really a Leonard Cohen album.

It's just a collection of songs that have been rearranged and changed and turned into a Leonard Cohen album.  It's not Leonard Cohen.  I don't like this album or Leonard Cohen.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I've heard no complaints from the band, and have a couple of friends that are fans and have loved the band since day one. The band has been very generous with fans lately and has been very generous with the press, which is great to hear, and that's why the band has been able to maintain the high quality of the music.

I have to say that this is the band's first album in over a year, and they need to make a "new" record, but they are not doing that. I am very upset about the lack of new material, and I would like to hear new tunes, instead of the same old songs, with the same old lyrics, and the same old music. The songs are good, but I don't think they would be as good as the new material they could have done. Please do what you can do to make the next album. We all love this band, but they need to make some new music.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I love this album, and I especially love the songs.  This is by far her best album, but I still have my favorites.  I like the first song, "Honey", but I like "Lonely Girl" the best.  I really like "Just Breathe" and "Don't Stop".  I like "Too Little Too Late" and "Wish I Could".  I think she's great in each of these songs.  It's hard to pick a favorite, but I think I would have to go with "Wish I Could" for the last song on the album.  Lenny Kravitz is a very talented and unique musician.  I really love his music and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  I also really like his lyrics, and his songs are so simple yet powerful.

Amazon review: If you're a Regina Spektor fan, you are a fan of a great artist.  It's really hard to choose the best songs on her latest album, "The Bones of What You Believe".  What I am about to say is going to sound like I am stating the obvious, but just in case you haven't heard this album, you really need to check it out.  I have listened to this album twice, and I think it is even better than her previous album.  The songs are so well done and so well produced, they are awesome.  I also think this album is a whole lot better than her previous one, which by the way, was pretty good.

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was under the impression it had "Amazing Grace" with a Pan Flutist  that I was looking for.  I was very disappointed that it was not!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A good song but I did not like it as much as the rest of the album.  I do not like the song "I'm with U Gotta Love U"  and the chorus.  I prefer it not being sung by a man.  I do like the song "Praise the Lord"  and "I'm with You"  but I do not like the middle parts of "Praise the Lord" and "I'm with You".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There are some good songs on this album, but not the best in my opinion.  "Praise the Lord"  with a piano is cool, but I like the other songs better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Great album by the way, loved all the songs on this one. The only bad thing is the vocals in the chorus in "I'm With You" with the guy singing is not that great.  I'm thinking maybe Amy Macdonald wasn't that great and she wasn't singing the song like a woman.  It sounded more like it came from a guy, but that's just me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is an great album for the price, but the music is very repetitive.  I have to stop listening to it after the first 45 minutes.  I think that's just me, but it's the only thing I have to complain about. I am a fan of Amy Macdonald.  I just don't like the repetitive nature of the songs on this album.
