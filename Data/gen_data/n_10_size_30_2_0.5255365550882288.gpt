The best thing about this album is that the songs are in the same range as my favorite songs from the 90s, but the vocals and lyrics are better.

The album starts with the intro, then one of the tracks, and then the next song. This was an amazing track, and I can't wait for the next song.

I have a feeling that the reason this band is so popular is because the name is so catchy. I know it's not a perfect album, but it's catchy enough to get people to listen. There's a lot of good songs on there. Just don't listen to it. I don't know if I would buy another album from this band.

I had this album on my ipod, but was not pleased with it. I think the vocals were too high pitched. I would not buy it again, unless it was for a friend or for the cover art.

This album is so good. There are about 2-3 new "Alarm bells" that show the bands range. If you like rockin' hard rock, you will like this. I've been listening to this album for a few weeks and am hooked because of the quality of the band's music. I would recommend to anyone who likes good rock and heavy metal.

I love this album - it sounds like a good effort by a band that's been around for a while. There's a lot of energy and passion in the music - definitely a great start! I was a bit worried about this album, because it was a bit of a departure from the band's previous work, but I have to say I'm really into this album. I bought it to see what the band was all about, but I'm really enjoying it. Good, clean, good heavy rock.

This album is a good example for what can be done musically with a modern rock band. Great song writing, great songs with great songs, nice vocals, nice guitar, nice bass guitar. There's a lot of energy in the music and it comes across nicely.

This is a great album. I thought this album would be boring after the first listen, but after two more tries I realized that this album is a really great work of art. The first time through the album I couldn't really grasp the entire album, but after a few times I got a grasp on the whole concept. The guitar work is really good, and the bass is also very good. The vocals are also great on this album. The songs were catchy and also made me feel that it was a real rock album. I would rate this album as an 8 or 9.

I haven't heard anything from this band before this, but I have heard of them before. I can say that they are very talented musicians and their music is very good. They write good music and they have good guitar work. I would say that this is a really good album.

This album was good, but I have to say that it could have been

Bands like The Amorphous and The B-52's were very popular in the 1980's. These two bands were also known for their unique voices. The Amorphous was a band from New Jersey and they made this album in New York. This album was released in 1986. The B-52's was from California and they made this album in 1987. The album features songs by both bands. I have no idea what The B-52's is about, but I do know that it is one of my favorite bands.

I Was A Teenage Girl - The B-52's

For all the young girls that have been told to never speak out, and for all the young girls that have been told to never trust anyone, I have been telling you to do just the opposite. I was a teenage girl. For the first time in my life I was a teenager. You've been told so much about the teenage years, you've been told so many lies, you've been told so many things to avoid, you've been told so many lies about the teenage years, you've been told so many lies about the teenage years, and you're still here, and you're still here.

I feel that you girls have been lied to so much that it's become a cycle. You're told that you shouldn't date, you're told to be careful, you're told not to have sex, you're told you're not pretty enough, you're told you have to wait until you're older, you're told you're too old, and you're told you're too young. You've been lied to so much. You've been told so many lies, and you still have to go through the lie after lie after lie, and you still go through it.

I feel like if you girls knew what you had been lied to about, and what you've been lied to about, you would never go through the lie after lie after lie, and you would never go through the lie after lie after lie, and you wouldn't go through the lie after lie after lie.

I think that the reason that you aren't being taken seriously, and the reason that you aren't being taken seriously, is because

This is an amazing album. Not only do the lyrics and music stand out from the rest of the "alternative" or alternative rock songs, but the production is impeccable. If I had to pick ANY of their albums to buy, I would choose this one. But I have to say, I was not blown away with most of their albums. I listen to at least one album a year, so I can say I have their albums on my "must listen to" list. This is a great addition to my collection. I would listen to this album again, and again, and again, and again.

All I can say is that it’s a formulaic rip-off and nothing more.
There is no passion or substance on this album.
I’m a huge fan of this band and I am extremely disappointed by the quality of this album.
It’s a shame.

Amazon review: This album was so lame that I didn't even bother listening to it. I was too young to know what was going on with the music. I have only heard the songs listed here on the internet and this is the first time I ever heard any of them. I am not sure which songs I liked the most. I only heard a few of them and that is probably one of the reasons why I hate this album so much. I guess I am glad I didn't pay for this album.
