Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: Tom Scott continues his journey in music. Not only does his music continue  to amaze us but, we become part of his journey. Simply, amazing.

Amazon review: Great album.  Really, really nice album.  Very nice vocals.  Love her singing voice.  I also like the way she plays the piano.  I can't decide which is my favorite part of the album.  I like the song, "I'm in love with you, but I don't know what to do."  I think she is in the middle of a ballad, and also the ballad is going in the wrong direction.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Nice to see old jazz standards performed by new jazz musicians.  The album has a familiar feel, but this group is not a traditional jazz group.  My favorite track is "It Might Be Your Love."  I like this song because it's a good example of how to perform a ballad.  The rest of the album is very good, but I tend to listen to the more complex songs.  I would recommend this album.  It's a great example of a band that is taking jazz to another level.

Amazon review: This album is not my cup of tea.  The arrangements seem to be very much like the arrangements that were on the first 10 albums on the jazz label.

The album is a tribute to his early years in the Count Basie Orchestra.

Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: If I could give this one star, I would've given it 3.  This is an awful album.  I am not a fan of Bonnie Tyler.  The songs are ok, but the music is awful.  The worst part of the album is the vocals.  I am not a fan of her singing voice.  I am a fan of the song selection.  It's nice to have a song that you love, but the albums that I have listened to have been better than this one.  The lyrics are terrible, and I can't stand Bonnie Tyler.  I am a fan of The Pretenders and I don't like her voice.  This doesn't even make the list of albums I would give a 3-star rating.  I can't imagine anyone buying this album.  It's not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  To the anonymous reviewer:  I can't believe you said that this is on your list of favorite albums.  I bought this album in the first week of December and have been listening to it ever since.  I've only owned one album by Bonnie Tyler.  I love her voice.  The album is well worth the money.  I believe it's worth more than $5 to me.  And I think I might have to buy another.  I have a hard time listening to it, but it's worth listening to.  I don't want to give away any of the songs, so I'll just say that they are great.  It doesn't make the list of my favorite albums, but it's the album that I listen to the most when I don't have time to listen to any of the other albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't care what anyone says, this album is not worth the $14.99.  Bonnie is one the best singers but this album is a waste of time. Even the songs she sings are terrible.  I don't understand how anyone would listen to this album.  Bonnie and the Pretenders are much better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I received the album today & I have to say... I am not impressed.  I have a hard time understanding why I would enjoy this album.  The songs are nice, and the vocals are ok.  I don't know how anyone could like this album.  It's disappointing.  I've been listening to this album since my birthday.  I'm guessing this is the 2nd album I've listened to in the past few weeks.  I hope that this is not the 2nd album I've listened to this past year.  I'm not looking to get rid of the album, but I have to say... I'm not impressed.  I really don't like the album.

Amazon review:  I bought this new cd just to have a listen to it.  I have been listening to the Pretenders records since I was 11-16, but this album has a totally different sound, and I didn't know that this was the Pretenders that Bonnie had been working on.  I like the old songs on this album, but I don't know if I can take listening to this album anymore.

Amazon review: I'm going to have to agree with the anonymous reviewer.  This is not a good album.  The songs are ok, but the music is awful.  It's not worth the $14.99.  I'll put this down as a non-recommended album.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!

A:

You should have bought the CD at the time she was recording the first album, the original version was released as a single in early 1986.  She never went back to the studio to record the first album, so there's no reason to expect that you would.  It's definitely possible that she did, but it's not certain to be true.  I don't know which of her back-to-back tours was when she recorded the album.  I think you should buy the CD now and not wait for it to be re-released.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: I had a good time here. I also enjoyed the "I'm Yours" video as well. The album is good and the song is good. I enjoyed the last song(which I didn't know was going to be on the album until I listened to it) and I thought the song was very good.  I don't think I know the first song on the album, but I'm sure I'll like it (and probably buy it).  I was disappointed to hear that they used the same song "I'm Yours" on the album and the single "It's Yours" on the album. I would have liked to have heard the original song on this album.

Amazon review: At first I did not understand why I should buy this cd. I was even a little disappointed. I then realized I should buy this cd because the songs are better than most of the CD's I have listened to at this time. I have listened to this album so much, I feel I have it memorized. I listen to this cd over and over again, and I don't know what more to say. (except that it is a good CD and I really like)

Amazon review: This is a great CD.  I am a huge fan of R.Kelly and I really appreciate his talent.  I would have preferred a remix cd as a little more of his talent comes through in the music.  I have always loved R.Kelly's voice and his music.  I really liked this cd.  I don't think it is for the casual listener, but if you enjoy R.Kelly then you will enjoy this CD.

Amazon review: This cd is good.  I have always been a fan of R.Kelly and this one is no different.  I still continue to listen to R.Kelly's albums (at a much slower speed) because I know he still has much more to come.  If you are a fan of R.Kelly then you will enjoy this CD.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.

Amazon review: I love the Dave Clark Five.  I have several of their albums and every one I have is a favorite.  I love that each album has something different.  I like that you can hear the changes in the music as time progresses.  I was surprised at the quality of the recording on this album.  I thought the sound quality would be lower, but I was surprised that it is much higher than I expected.  I was also surprised by the recording quality.  I have been told that this is one of the best recordings I have ever purchased.  I would recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: This album has been on the radio for a long time.  I like it but I don't think it's very good.  Some of the vocals are very un-professional.  The arrangement is not very good.  Some of the lyrics are not very good.  I think that you should make a new album with songs that you like.

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have only one complaint about this collection- there are no bonus tracks. The only other negative is that there is no information given on the back cover and I had to look it up on Amazon to find out information on who performed what. The reviews that I've read on each show are all good and I have also listened to the reviews. I think the collection is very good and I was very excited about it when I first heard it. I have some negative feelings about it now, but I am not going to purchase it. I have given it 5 stars, but I can't change my mind. I really liked some of the songs, but the overall impression left is that I will not buy this collection. I will continue to listen to the collection on itunes though. I was hoping for some bonus tracks, but I guess not. I don't know what the deal is. I will say that I am always very pleased with the performances in this collection.

Amazon review: I was very excited to purchase and received a package in the mail and opened it to find a wonderful set of music for my listening pleasure. I got The Best of the Best and I am looking forward to listening to it and finding out what the artist can do with so many great songs. I have not heard any of these songs but read some reviews so I am anxious to hear the set of songs that I ordered. I am a fan of Ernie's and have been for years. I have had the pleasure of seeing the great artist perform and would not have been able to do so without the support of my friends who are lifelong fans.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Ornette Coleman for years and I've been so happy and excited to finally get this collection. I'm not sure if I should be excited about the songs or not, but all the songs are very good. I'm very surprised about all the songs that they played including The Best of the Best by Ernie. Every performance is unique and I'm looking forward to listening to the music and finding out what all the hype is about. I wish I would have ordered the entire collection but I'm glad I got some of the songs.

Amazon review: After buying this collection I had to listen to all the songs. Some are good and some are bad. I have to tell you the only good song is the one with Elvis on it. The rest was very good. I wish I had saved the money so I could have bought the entire collection. I would not have paid $120.00 for this collection. I would have been very disappointed.

Amazon review: A very good collection of Ornette's best songs, and is the best collection of his material yet. The only bad thing is that it took me a long time to get to listen to all of the songs. There are only 7 of them and I thought I heard them all. I'm very excited to listen to the songs. I have the entire collection on CD and cassette and I think I would have been disappointed if I had gotten this collection on CD. I have the cassette. I am trying to figure out how to listen to it without cassette tape, but I think I'll just have to sit down and listen to it on CD. I have listened to a few of the songs and they are all good.

Amazon review: This collection includes his best songs but I wish they were a little longer. The performances on here are very good. There are some songs that are very good but the rest are very bad. I have to admit that I have never really heard Ornette Coleman perform in person. I was very excited to hear him perform at the Jazz Cafe in New Orleans. I was very impressed with his performance. The song with Elvis is very good.

Amazon review: I was really hoping to like this CD, but I did not. I'm a huge jazz fan and this CD is not jazz, it's more like a crappy jazz album. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because it is a cd that is in the jazz genre. It's hard to believe that this album is called 'her' album. It's not hip-hop, soul, or blues. It has a lot of hip-hop and soul music. I hope that this cd can be re-released with her name on the cover.

Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

My Thoughts - R.Kelly Review

I'm going to do my best to review all the albums I've reviewed for you guys but I'd like to do a little more than just a review of all the albums and I wouldn't want to be the "reviewer" for every album out there. There are some albums that I loved and some albums I didn't love but I'd like to take a look at them. This album was one of the albums that I didn't love. I'm going to do my best to give you guys my own take on it. I'll give you my take on why I didn't like the album. I'll try to give you my take on what it's all about. The album was a little short but I think it will be a good listen for you guys.

R.Kelly: My Thoughts

I've had the opportunity to listen to this album for the first time in a few days. I've listened to it several times since then and I have a lot to say about it. I've listened to a lot of albums and I have a lot to say about a lot of albums. I can't say I've heard this album for the first time in a few days but I have been listening to it for a few days. This is not my first time listening to R.Kelly. I'm not going to try to review every album that I've reviewed for you guys but I will say that I've heard a lot of albums and I have a lot to say about them. I'm going to start out with a few basic things about the album.

First off...

It's a lot of R&B. I would say it has a lot of 70's soul on it. I'm not trying to say that it's not R&B but if I listen to it today
