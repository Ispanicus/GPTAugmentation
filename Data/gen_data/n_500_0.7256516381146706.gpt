The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music!

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: What is going on here?  It seems to me that the first section of this piece was composed, and was not a part of the performance that the group was able to produce.  I'm not surprised by this - I've been told that the group has a lot of fun doing music that is not for public performance, and I've been told that their performances are not for the public, which is a shame, because there are a lot of good performances on the CD that deserve to be heard by the public.  I'm sorry, but I have to be honest - this music is not for me.

Amazon review: The instrumentation is very interesting, the dynamics of the notes are quite different to what I've heard before. The song is well sung and the musicians are good at what they do, but there is something about the overall tone that I don't like.  The music seems to be a combination of two different styles (acoustic and electric) which together create a new sound.  This is the first time I've heard a song written for a piano and a trumpet and a violin, and I think it is a great song.  I'm not really into this style of music, but the song is very good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good song.  The trumpet is used very well, and the keyboard and vocals are very well arranged.  The piano is used in a very interesting way, not really a typical piano piece.  The organ needs a little work, but it does have a nice sound to it.  I would have liked to hear more organ, but it is a good instrument.  This is a very good CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an interesting CD.  The music is beautiful, the lyrics are quite appropriate for the message, and the instrumentation is good.

I would have liked to hear more singing, but the vocal performance is good.  Overall, I would recommend this CD.

Thank you for your great review! This is the first time I have heard the piece, and I love it! One thing that puzzles me is that the band is described as being "very good at what they do." The entire band is excellent, and I would classify them as "very good." If I were at the studio recording this, I would be very proud of the recording. I am very happy to hear that your first impression was negative and that the piece was enjoyed.

I have bought this CD a week or two ago and I just recently got it home and got to work. I am very impressed with how well the music came out! It

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: I just downloaded this song and was immediately disappointed. I thought it was great, but then I listened to the lyrics and I realized that it really sucks. The lyrics are not great, the melody is bad, and the singer's voice is terrible. I will probably never listen to another single by them.

Amazon review: I have a lot of negative reviews for this album. I think I have it on good authority that it is the worst thing I have ever heard. I have a friend who is a little different, but he thinks this album is very good, especially in the song "All Night". I'm not very good at writing reviews, so I don't know how to describe it. I think it's good, but I don't know if it's good. It can be a bit annoying, but there aren't any songs that are so bad that I couldn't listen to them. They are not terrible, and I think I might buy it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD a couple of times and I like it. I think it is a great mix of rock and pop. The lyrics are somewhat generic - they seem like they may be about a lot of different things. Maybe that's just my age - I am 43. It is not bad, but I think I will never buy this CD, even after hearing it a couple of times.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
