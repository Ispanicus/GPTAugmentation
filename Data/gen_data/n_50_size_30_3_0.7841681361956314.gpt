Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I've only heard this one, and I'm not even a big fan of this kind of band.  I was introduced to Hall and Oats by my sister.  We had a great time listening to their live shows and then went to their website to listen to the  new song.  It was nice and I loved the song but I thought it was just a little bit too repetitive.  I've heard the songs before and am used to it.  The new song was okay but not great and I don't know what's so new about it.

Amazon review: I saw them live on the east coast and they were great with their band and their sound.  Just wish there was a real band like them.  I'm a fan of the old band and I'm a fan of the new.  They're pretty much the same as they were back then.  They're still my favorite band.

I bought the CD, and like usual, I listened to it and thought that I may have been wrong. 
I gave it back to the seller, and he said that he had tried to fix it, but that he would continue to listen to them and that he would try to get a hold of him.
I checked the disc and I was told that it had a defect, and I was asked to send it back.  I said no, and that I would pay for the shipping, but I did not get any money back.
I am now trying to get a hold of them through their website.

I bought this CD for my son, and it was recommended to me.  I told him that the CD was very good, and that he should buy it.  I also told him to listen to the song that I found to be funny.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD back in 2004. I am not sure it was on sale so I bought it. I liked the sound of this album quite a bit. This is not a "typical" album. I did not find it to be dated. There was a period of time when some of the songs seemed to be a little "out of sync" with the rest of the album. That being said, I am glad I purchased this album when I did because I really like this album. I am only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have had other, better albums, but this one, at least, is still a good one.

This is an album that I bought in the very beginning of my music listening years. I can honestly say that I love this album. I had heard a lot of good reviews on it and as a fan of the band I was very excited to find out that the quality was actually good. The sound quality is very crisp and clear. The album does not get boring at all. The guitar work is very solid. Very melodic with great solos. The vocals are great. The lyrics are quite deep with some of the lyrics being very profound. The band is very tight and makes music that is very enjoyable. To be honest, I still listen to this album on a regular basis. I do wish that the album had a little more funk in it but I don't think that's possible. The album is very good.

This band has had some great albums over the last 20 years. I have always liked their music. This is one of the most underrated albums. It is an all original album. The songs are very catchy and upbeat. The vocals are fantastic. This is a very good album that will have you singing along to the rest of the songs.

I have been a fan of this band since 1999. I still love their music. I like to listen to their music for fun and I'm not a music writer so I have no idea how well this album is. But it's not bad. I do like it. I don't think I'll get a CD of the band ever again.

This band has had some great albums over the last 20+ years. I have always liked their music. This is one of the best songs of theirs, but that's because it's so good, but it's just a song that has a lot of good things going for it. It's a fairly typical band song (although it does have the word "love" in it), but I really like that it's different from the rest of the songs. It's not something that will stick out, it's not something that will be recognizable to anyone who doesn't like this band, but it's very good stuff.

This band has had some great albums over the last 20 or more years. I have always liked their music. This album is great. They have a great sound and this album is a really good album. I really like this album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This is not the Christmas CD for me this year. I was looking forward to hearing the songs from the first time, and was really hoping to hear the duets. Instead, I heard a lot of songs I had never heard before and I didn't really know what to expect. I thought maybe she could do a really good version of "Christmas Time is Here" but she did not. I heard "I've Got a Little Christmas Tree" and it was okay. I am not a huge fan of Christmas music so I thought that was okay, but then she said she wanted to sing a song about not being able to buy a Christmas tree because she just doesn't have the money, and I thought that was okay, but she was singing about being cold and having to go without a Christmas tree. I thought that was okay, but then she sang "I've Got a Little Christmas Tree" about having to go without a Christmas tree. I don't know how many CDs I've listened to that I have liked, but I did not enjoy this one. I guess I just can't get into it, but I don't know why I don't like it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I give this CD 3 stars for the title song - "How Great Thou Art" - but only 1 star for the rest of the CD. It was nice to have the music of both the Old and New Testaments, and to hear them all together - but I could listen to the same tunes over and over.

Amazon review: I purchased this cd as I am a big fan of Chris Tomlin and his "Born Again" radio show. I am not a Christian, but I have been listening to "Born Again" for many years.  I have listened to the CD several times, and I have been happy with the songs.  Chris Tomlin makes me smile and feel good.  I like his song "I'm Not Ashamed" (I'm not).  I have listened to his CD's several times.  I have read and heard that some of the musicians on this CD are being sued by the labels for using copyrighted songs.  I am not sure how that affects the cd.  I would love to have the cd in my collection on my ipod or something.  I am an adult, and I do not want to get into debt to buy a cd.  I have listened to the words and the music of the songs many times.  I have heard the songs on TV shows in the past.

I have also liked his CD's, "This is My Story" and "I Want to Thank You".  I have also been listening to Chris Tomlin's CD's since I was about 19 years old.

The music is great, and its a really good alternative to the usual pop, rock / metal type music. The lyrics are great, and are in english. The music is great to listen to, and the vocals by kristian are very nice, and i think they are one of the best vocalists in metal. The production is great, and the artwork is also great, i think the cover art was well done. So i think if you like the normal type of rock/metal music, this album is for you.

Amazon review: I have listened to "Halo" (also called "The Halo" ) many times in my day, but never fully realized what a spectacular album it is.
It is very interesting to listen to an album and not really want to listen to it, because it is like the music is not even there, it just sits there in the background and you just listen to it for a few minutes, and then it is gone. Even though, it is a great album, there are a few things that did not make me want to listen to it more.
1) The first track, "Halo" is good, but it gets boring and repetitive after a while.
2) The end of the song is a good surprise, but it is not so good to have a song end before the other, and be so short.
3) The second song, "Halo" is just a filler, I did not like it very much. It is not really a good song.
4) The next song, "Blind", is also just a filler, I did not really like it.
5) "Halo" is one of the best songs on the album. It is very good. It is one of the best songs I have ever heard.
6) The last song, "Crazy Love" is just a filler, but it is nice to have a filler song.
7) The next song, "One Man Army", is just a filler, I did not like it.
8) The next song, "The Halo", is just a filler, I did not like it.
9) The next song, "Blind", is just a filler, I did not like it.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Lin Manuel Miranda is, without a doubt, one of the most talented, prolific and influential songwriters in the world.  He understands the importance of music in shaping the culture, and he has dedicated his life to making it.  When artists such as Miranda, Bob Dylan, J.S. Bach, Mozart, and Van Cliburn come through, it is a great opportunity to learn something about the history of the art form, and one can only hope to be as lucky as they were in their lifetimes.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  Lin Manuel Miranda's Hamilton is a truly impressive effort, and it's all because of Lin himself.  He has never looked back.  The music of Hamilton is nothing short of an epic masterpiece.  Hamilton is the story of a man from the 17th century who has to fight to be the king of America.  Miranda has truly captured the spirit of that era, and the musical itself is a masterpiece.  The Hamilton soundtrack is a very well done, and I give it the highest possible rating.

Amazon review: I think this is the best album to get right at this time since it so far is the best album I have heard by Kendrick Lamar.  There are no real downers.  This album has the best range of styles I have heard in a long time.  I have always liked his style and am glad he decided to release this album and I like the fact that he chose to not choose any artist to create a cover.  All of the songs are extremely well produced and there are no real downers.  
There are other albums on this list that I would listen to if and when Kendrick comes out with a new album.  This album has a lot of songs that you will want to listen to when he comes out with another album.

Amazon review: I have been listening to artists like The Beatles, The Eagles, The Cars, The Rolling Stones, and even the Beatles again.  It's a new age of music, and I've discovered some amazing artists that I didn't know existed.  I hope I never have to sound like I'm complaining.  I love the fact that there are new great artists coming out of the underground.  It's like a new school of music or a new school of art.  It's hard to say which one.  Whatever the best one is, that's what I'm going to listen to.  It's a great time to be alive.  Thanks to everyone who is out there making music.  I really appreciate it.  You all are awesome.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this album, it's not a one to be missed.  One of the best albums I have heard in years.  I love the fact that he sings as a woman.  I love the fact that his vocals are more in tune than his male vocals.  I love the fact that he sings in a lower register than he does in his male voice.  I love the fact that his songs are very personal.  It's great when a musician does that.  It's great when a musician does something that's his own.  This is a great album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Meghan Trainor, and for quite some time I have been waiting to hear new music by her.  I bought this album on iTunes and I'm glad I did.  It's hard for me to say anything bad about this album, but I have to say that I am tired of the repetitiveness of the songs.  The album has a different sound than the last couple of albums she released, and it doesn't fit into the "pop" sound she had in the past.  I'm getting tired of meandering songs that just do not connect to the message of the songs.  It's hard to listen to this album for more than a few minutes.  I do like the new songs, but I just don't have the patience to get through them.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

If you're into metal then definitely by far worth it.

Review by: Rachael on September 22, 2009 15:41

This album is great! I'm a huge fan.

Review by: katie on November 26, 2009 04:01

This album is so much fun! It's so different and refreshing. It's a perfect mix of metal and the most awesome and exciting songs I've ever heard. And I'm not even a fan of metal. If you're looking for a fun, different, and absolutely incredible album, this is it.

Review by: katie on November 26, 2009 05:01

This is a great album for all fans of metal. Just the right amount of variety in different areas.

Review by: jedibw on December 06, 2009 09:36

I love it. I have listened to all of the albums on this list, but this one is definitely the best. It has the perfect amount of variety. It's not just one kind of metal, it's all of it. It's a bit boring at times, but when it hits, it hits and is awesome.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This has to be one of the most beautifully written operas I've ever heard!  I'm not gonna lie.  It's not that this is a bad opera, it's just that it's not as good as I thought it would be since I started reading the reviews. I'm not saying I don't like it, but I'm not going to say it's excellent and that's what I was expecting when I clicked the image of the book and listened to the CD.  I wasn't disappointed, but I'm not going to say it's a masterpiece and that was what I was hoping for.

Amazon review: I was lucky enough to stumble upon this CD that I purchased from a local Christian bookstore.  I hadn't heard of Casting Crowns yet, but I happened to see these songs on the CD cover.  I was intrigued and purchased the CD without listening to the CD cover first.  I love the music, and I was drawn to the first song on the CD, but I did not like the sound of the recording.  I thought that the recording sounded too raw and sounded like it was recorded in a garage, so I listened to the second song (God in Me), and that is when I realized that this is not a recording.  I was surprised to see that the recording was so good, and I loved it.  I love the music.  The songs are lovely, and the choir is wonderful.

Amazon review: I bought this cd before finishing it, and while listening to it, I realized that I had not been listening to the songs in their entirety.  It was only when I was listening to the last song that I realized that I had not been listening to the songs in their entirety, which was "The Worshippers Arise" and "My Peace is Your Comfort".  I had not been listening to them in their entirety because I was so excited about what I was hearing on the CD cover.  After listening to the entire CD, I realized that I had not been listening to the songs in their totality.  It was one of the most moving CDs that I have ever listened to.  It made me feel so much better about my life.  I would not recommend this disc to anyone, but I wouldn't want to listen to it just once either.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  From the first moment I heard this CD, I was completely captivated and had to listen to it several times.  It is a moving, emotional, and spiritually uplifting experience.  The music, choir, and lyrics are all masterfully blended together to create a powerful and heart-wrenching experience that will leave you with a desire to listen to it again and again.  I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who is truly seeking to worship God and find true peace in his presence.

Amazon review: I bought a CD of this opera from a Christian book store.  I read the reviews and immediately ordered it.  I had no idea that it was going to be so beautiful, so powerful, so powerful. The music is beautiful and the choir is wonderful.  I loved the songs, but the recording was awful.  The music was not clear and the recording sounded terrible. It was just a mess.  I was so disappointed in the recording because I was expecting something like the CD cover.  I was not expecting the quality of the CD, but I was expecting more.  I did not like this CD.  I have to say that I am happy that I bought it, but I am not going to listen to it again.  I am going to listen to it for a week or two and then return it.  I will listen to it when I have nothing to listen to.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

At the end, I had to listen to this one again to get the whole thing.  It is worth the time and effort.  I could not get to the end of the disc without going through the whole song list.

Amazon review: This is the second Schubert album that I have had that had a great cover.  The first one, Das Lied von der Erde, was the first one I had.  The cover is beautiful.  There are some mistakes with the lyrics, but it isn't bad.  This one has a beautiful cover.  The album is very well done.  The first disc is Schubert songs, the second disc is songs written especially for Mozart.  This album is a great album.  The music is very nice.  The sound quality is very good.

Amazon review: I purchased it to listen to Schubert's music.  I have heard all his music.  I love it.  This is the first album that I have had of Schubert's that I have liked and that I have heard.

Amazon review: The first time I heard these songs was when I was in kindergarten.  These songs were sung by my friend who was one of the voices.  I thought they were beautiful and very beautiful.  I would listen to them often.  I didn't know they were so beautiful when I was in kindergarten.  When I started high school, I had an opportunity to listen to them again.  I fell in love with them.  They are so beautiful that I wanted to learn more about them.  I am not sure I will learn more about them.  After a few months, I have a better understanding of the words and the music.  I will be listening to them a lot more now.  I have listened to the CDs a few times now, and I have fallen in love with them.  My friends say that they are great.  They are great.  The words are beautiful and the music is really beautiful.  This is the first CD I have bought that I really can't wait to listen to.  I have fallen in love with these songs.  They are so beautiful, they are so beautiful.  I have heard everything that Schubert has ever written.  There is not one song that I have not heard.  There are some songs that are just so beautiful, I am not sure that I could find a way to listen to them all.  I am sure that I will be learning about them a lot more.  I am really looking forward to learning more.  I do not know how to describe this album.  It is like Schubert, but it is not Schubert.  I have been listening to this album for a few months now.  It is not easy to describe it.  There is so much music, and I can't even begin to tell you what it is.  But I have fallen in love with this album.  I have fallen in love with all of Schubert's songs.  I just can't believe that I have fallen in love with them all.  Even the songs that are not Schubert's songs, I fell in love with them.  I have fallen in love with these songs.  They are great.  They are great.  I do not know why I am falling in love with the songs, but I am.  They are wonderful.  They are wonderful.  They are wonderful.  I have fallen in love with them all.

I listened to it twice and it just was...well, it was the best version of the song I've ever heard.  Not only was the song great, but it had some great moments.  It was perfect.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Meh. Didn't really live up to the expectations. Could have been better.

Amazon review: I like this album.  The only reason why I gave it four stars is because I really, really like the band, and this album is their best album.  I think they could have used more songwriting.  But the songs are great.  The lead singer has a voice that I can't quite put my finger on, it's like he's singing in a different language, but I can't place it.  I think his voice could have been a bit more energetic.  But overall, great album.  I give this album 3 stars.

Amazon review: I bought this CD from amazon.com to listen to on my ipod.  Unfortunately the sound is so bad on this machine that it's almost as if the sound quality of the CD is bad.  I don't know how, but the sound quality is so bad that I couldn't download any songs.

Amazon review: I was a bit disappointed in this album.  I love the sound of this, the voice of this is so special, the band is great, the music is great, but I just don't believe that they were able to write a few songs that really stand out.  I really like the music, but I don't think that it was a great release.

Amazon review: I bought this CD at the recommendation of a friend, on the recommendation of a friend, and on Amazon.com.  The CD was a great purchase, and I would buy this CD again.

I give this album 4 stars.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I feel like I may have watched this movie before but I don't remember when. I think it may have been in the 80's. I watched it with my sister and didn't think it was that great. I remember going to the theater with my sister and she didn't understand the plot. I think part of the problem is that it's a little slow. I remember laughing at the jokes and not caring what was going on. I'm not sure if I'm going to watch it again but I never felt like it was worth watching.

Amazon review: I believe this was written for a movie called "To Catch a Thief" but I don't know why. I think you may have seen it on a TV series. The movie took place in England and was very similar to the book. The music was amazing and the movie was good but the story was stupid.
