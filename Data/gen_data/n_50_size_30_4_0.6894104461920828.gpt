Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album has a variety of different types of songs and is also very varied in the songs you can sing along with.  There are so many different types of songs on this album, it's hard to say which ones are my favorites.  I like the way the songs are arranged.  They make me feel like I'm at a summer camp rather than a regular recording studio.  I always enjoy listening to songs I can sing along with.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes singing along with songs.  I would also recommend it to anyone who likes listening to different types of music.  It's not a "best of" album, it's a collection of different types of songs to enjoy and I like the variety.  This is my favorite CD from this year.  It's one of my favorite CDs of the year.

Amazon review: I know of this artist from his work on XM, but I haven't been able to find the artist's CD, so I've been trying to figure out who he is.  It seems that he is a singer, not a musician, and as such, he writes and performs songs for other singers.  The songs on the CD (I have yet to listen to all of them) are all very similar to each other.  I do like listening to the songs that are sung by different individuals, but I have trouble figuring out what the vocals are of each individual song.  I like the fact that they all sound very fresh.  I like that they are all different.  It's nice to hear songs that are written, but not sung by someone else.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It would appear that this is a collection of songs that are on a CD, but not necessarily arranged in a certain fashion.  There are some songs that contain piano accompaniment (one of the songs on the CD is in F, and the others are in G), and some songs have backing vocals (the CD has the songs "We Love (You)", "We Love (You, Too)", and "We Love (You, Too, Too, Too)").  Some of the songs have very simple lyrics, and others (such as the song "This Night") have very complex lyrics.  The songs do vary in tempo, but they don't vary in rhythm.    All of the songs on the CD are very well written, with a simple sound to them.  They all sound like they could be on a CD, which makes for a very nice listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The lyrics were interesting, but the music was mediocre.  The music was very slow, and I found it hard to follow, but I can understand how it would be very difficult to sing along to.  The songs that were written about life, death and love were well written, and were interesting to listen to.  I wish there had been more songs that were written about everyday life that was still interesting to listen to.  I would have liked to have been able to listen to a couple more songs about love.  The songs were interesting, but not very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I'm a huge fan of Tim McGraw.  I liked the songs on this CD, but I didn't buy it just because the songs on it are Tim McGraw songs.  The songs are all pretty good, but the lyrics were just lame, and the instrumentals weren't that interesting.  I'm not sure if the songwriting on this CD is Tim McGraw's fault, or if the music is just not that interesting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I purchased this CD because I was a huge fan of Tim McGraw and this album was available.  I was disappointed to learn that this was not a Tim McGraw CD at all.  The album is very boring and could have been a series of songs on the same record.  I'm not sure of the connection between the songs.  I think it is just a collection of songs with a similar title.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is a collection of songs about love, loss, life, and life after death.  The songs are very well written, and each song is sung by different individuals.  I thought the songs were very well written and had a very good message.  The only thing that I did not like was that the songs were all sung by different individuals, unlike some of the other albums that I have purchased.  For some reason, I do not like listening to songs that are all sung by the same singer.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone.  It's not that good.  The only reason I would recommend this CD to anyone

Amazon review: This is a great CD for the classical listener.  The vocals are lovely and even the choirs have nice harmonies.  I'm sure a lot of folks will agree.

Amazon review: I saw this CD was going for a low price and decided to pick it up.  I'm glad I did.  I'm glad I bought it.  It is one of the best CDs I have ever heard!  The choir has that wonderful "WOW!" factor that has been missing in a long time.    The choral arrangements are so unique and wonderful.  It is not too often that you hear a choir that sounds this good!    I've been listening to Libera all my life and this is the best I have ever heard.    You would have loved it back in the day when I was a kid listening to them on the "Lifelines" radio show.    It is a wonderful album that is worth the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

About This Listing:

This listing is a nice piece of music with a great value for the money.  The music is very well recorded, the sound is good and the quality of the CD is excellent.

Listening to this music will make you feel great!  The album is "Mellow Melodies" by the  New York Philharmonic.  This is the first time I listened to this music.  As a classical music listener, I have wanted to hear this album for a long time.

The Music:

I have heard the New York Philharmonic a couple of times and have only been able to get to see them live once.  I must say I was not disappointed.  I have to say that the New York Philharmonic is one of the best orchestras in the world and I am very glad I got to hear them play this recording.  The musicians are always on top of their game.  The conductor is outstanding and so is the soloist.   I would like to say that this is the best recording I have ever heard of the New York Philharmonic.  I have heard many but this is the best.  I recommend this to all classical music music lovers.

This is a nice classical CD with a great value.

It was very interesting to hear the New York Philharmonic, while I was in the  southland.  It was very good to hear the  New York Philharmonic playing.  I don't usually listen to classical music during the day, but I thought this was a good choice to do so.  This music was very interesting and I really enjoyed it.

Amazon review: I've been waiting to hear this song for over a year now, and I know it was a bad year for K-pop.  It is not a good song overall, it's just a mediocre song with a mediocre sound, mediocre vocals, and mediocre music.  The only redeeming qualities about this song were the chorus, and the instrumentals.  It's not an all time classic, nor is it the best K-pop song of the year.  The best K-pop song of the year has to be "Let's Go", but that's not very K-pop, it's a Japanese/Korean song.  I would say this song makes up for "Let's Go" and a K-pop song of the year. That's it, just a mediocre song with mediocre vocals and mediocre music.  I think K-pop fans could have done better with this song because it's not as good as "Let's Go".  It just doesn't have the same sound or quality that "Let's Go" has.  I think K-pop fans could have done better with this.  I will say there is a song that sounds similar to this song, but doesn't have the same sound or quality.  The song is called "I Believe" by BAND-MAID, and it sounds very similar.  It's by the same group, but it's the same album, so you know it is the same song.  I will say that they did better with "I Believe" than "Let's Go".  They could have replaced "I Believe" with "Let's Go", but they didn't.  It's just a mediocre song with mediocre vocals and mediocre music.  This song is not a great song, but it's not a bad song, it just isn't as good as "I Believe".  I'm sure there are more great songs out there that I will like, but this one isn't one of them.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: My wife bought me this album and i was very upset. Because i wanted to find out what is going on with my wife. And i was not happy with the result.  I was very disappointed with this album. It was very basic. There was no real emotion or drive.  I can't understand why people would spend so much money on an album that is basically a compilation of old songs. I do not understand why they would spend so much money on an album that is basically a compilation of songs that are 2-3 years old. I do not understand how people could spend so much money on an album with old songs.  Its unfortunate that this album is so basic.  I am a big fan, but i feel that this album has been taken over by the masses and people who have no idea what they are supposed to buy or if they like it or not.  I do not understand how people can spend so much money on something that is nothing more than a compilation of songs that are 2-3 years old.

 Amazon review:  He's a little bit off, but the music is nice, the lyrics are good.  Not the best song in the world, but there is something there.  Some of the songs are really good, like the one we're hearing now and the one we're hearing a few seconds ago.  I think the album's overall value is about $10, but I'd be willing to spend $8 to get something that is more worth it.  I wish the album had some songs that are on some of the other albums.  I'm sure there is some other good stuff in here, but the songs that I've heard are kinda repetitive.  I like the way this plays, but the music is so bland.  The bass is a little off in many songs, but the vocals are okay.  The vocals are a little bit off in some songs, but the vocals are okay.

Amazon review:  This is an excellent album.  The music is very good, and will be a favorite of mine for a long time.  The best songs here are "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4" and "Me Against Me", both of which are very old but are still enjoyable.  There are a few other songs that have a lot of potential, but I'm not sure they'll ever come around.  Overall, the album is very good.  The songs are good, but the music is not quite up to par with the other songs in the collection.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of soul music since '74, when I discovered the greats like Solomon Burke and the like.  I'm a big fan of this group,  as well as the one with Jimmy Smith.  I found I was able to relate to these guys because I had a father who had died a few years prior to these songs.  That gives you a place to start, even if you don't like their music.  I always loved the old-time music of Leadbelly and B.B. King and I am so glad I got to know Jimmy Smith.  I love when a band hits the right notes.

A good CD by a great band.  I love this band!  They were great, but, but, but, but...  I would also like to add that they are not "old school" or "traditional."  They play the music of the '60's and '70's and they are not a bunch of people that just sit there and play their instrument.  They are fun, and they play good music.  If you like '60's and '70's music, you will like this band.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

3. Go with the flow, don't listen to it with your head.

A:

It might be worth mentioning that the English lyrics are taken straight from the album, so if you're not that familiar with the original language, it might be a little difficult to understand what the lyrics are about.

A:

The first time I listened to this, I thought that the song was about a gay man (or a gay woman, maybe?). However, after I listened to it again, I figured out it was about a prostitute who is addicted to heroin. What I found even more interesting is that the song was written by a famous country singer, but the lyrics were written by an unknown artist.
I'm not sure if this would be considered offensive by some, but the song has definitely a certain meaning for some people. You can't really judge the meaning of a song by just listening to it.
I have listened to this song several times now, and I'm not sure if I would call it offensive to others. However, I don't think that many people would consider it offensive.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I first discovered them in the late 80's by listening to a local radio station on my way to school. They started at the same time as the other top acts in the area, so when the two bands first started to become a popular draw at school I was in complete shock. They were playing their original songs and I thought that was the only way they could play. The next day I was at the radio station and they were playing their original songs. I was so amazed that there was another band like them and they had a talent for writing and performing original material. I was blown away and was hooked instantly. Mumford is my all time favorite band and I'm still a huge fan. I was saddened when they broke up, but I'm really happy for them. I love how they have stayed true to themselves through their various success, and that is something that I never thought would happen in this day and age. Their music is a little bit of everything, and their music just doesn't stop. They have a style that will keep you listening for years to come.

Amazon review: This is the first album by The Libera Band, and I was very happy to find that they continued to write and record new material.    I am a bit disappointed in this release.  The group only recorded seven songs, and it is difficult to judge the quality of the songs.    The songs that are included here are mostly just "big band" numbers, with very little of interest in between.  The arrangements are very simple, and there is little variety.
