Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: In the 60's, the Drifters were the hottest group in America.  They changed all that with the Drifters and Drifters Revisited.  They are a prime example of how the band business is done today.  The songs are the same, but the arrangements are different.  The original lineup was the same.  The new lineup is the same except for a few replacements, but they are different for the most part.   This is a great band that doesn't let up.  If you are buying a used CD today, make sure the label is reputable, they are worth it.  If you are buying on Amazon, you're getting a great deal.  I recommend buying used rather than new, and you'll have a very good selection of albums and songs.  If you are a fan of the Drifters, this is the best way to go.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  I like the fact that it doesn't conform to any genre.  It's a real mix of everything.  I wish they had a little more of a singer, but then again, I like a little more of everything.  I like the music.  I like the story line.  I like the energy.  I like the lyrics.  In fact, I like the album a lot.  The only thing that I wish they would have done was maybe put a little more energy into the chorus of "Can't Lose If I Don't Try".  That's a little too much of a filler song.  The album is a real good deal on Amazon.  There are only a few songs that really don't have that "Drifters feel" to them.  I would have liked to have one song with more energy, but other than that, I think I am satisfied.  I will say the cover is a little misleading.  They have a lot of young men on the cover.  The songs on the cover don't show what the songs sound like.  That's not the point.  Most of the songs are good.  I agree with the negative sentiment.

Amazon review: I've been a fan since the 1960s and still love the Drifters.  The music is as great as ever.  I still am amazed at how well the band has managed to stay together for over 50 years.  I have a lot of respect for the Drifters and I think they deserve to be back in the spotlight.  If you haven't heard them before, I wouldn't go out of your way to buy the first CD.  You are missing out.  You are missing the music.  You are missing the story.

Amazon review: The Drifter is my all time favorite band.  They had a big hit "Drifters in the Night."  It has to be one of my all time favorites.  The song is not the only song they have.  They had the hit "I've Been Loving You" and the song has to be in the top 5 of all time.  I am going to take this opportunity to say that the new album is a real good deal on Amazon.  I really like the songs on this album.  I really like the songs on this album.  I really liked the album.  The songs are all good.  Some of the songs are not as good as others.  Some of the songs have really good arrangements, but some of the songs are just filler songs.  The songs on the cover seem like they fit the theme of the album.  There is no way the cover of this album should have been made the way it was made.  It's not a good cover, but it's not a bad cover either.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count).

Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

The lyrics can be a little difficult for some people to understand, but if you're a fan of this band, it should be fine.  The song is a little bit too short, but I think that's because it's a single?

Amazon review: Not much to say: Richie's voice is really quite impressive, he has a great high register and he has a great style. I just wish he would stop singing the way he does here, it is not really a good choice of vocals. He just sounds like an over-produced pop singer singing and over-emoting. I have never listened to "Fever" but I was not a fan of his music either, so I have no clue how he got away with it. I don't really care for "Fever" but I still like "Charmaine" or "Blue Moon" or "Hush".

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: This was not a bad album.  It had a few hits and a couple of decent songs but the bulk of it was pretty forgettable and unmemorable.  It was good I guess.  I was hoping for a bit more substance, but I guess there wasn't any.  I guess I am just one of those naysayers (in a small minority, mind you) and find the likes of Jay-Z, Beyonce, Rihanna, etc. to be the best at bringing out the best from their music.  And there was a lot of music in this album that wasn't bad, just not something I'd listen to again.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: you can tell this is not an original, buy the dubbing and sound quality.  I have and original jim Stafford album from the 70s and this is not the same  ouality of sound. sucks this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from England,

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: This is a great album, great voice, great song, very good sound, one of the best that I have had the chance to hear.  I would highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys a good sound quality and a great voice.  It's definetly worth the price, I just wish there was more music like this out there.

Amazon review: The Album is an original recording by the great Ms. Susan Boyle.  Very good quality sound, the best I have heard in the last 10 years.  I am a big fan of Ms. Susan Boyle, and I am VERY impressed and very happy with the sound of this Album.  I bought it on Ebay for $15.00, and I would love to see it in stores, but I have to wait until it is released.  I know that it is getting good reviews because I read all the reviews about it...I think I have a new fan.

Amazon review: My wife and I listen to this every day.  We love it.  I will never have another good song played so loud in my house.  It is so good.  The only problem with this disk is that it won't play in the car.  I have to get a CD player.  This is a great album.  I am happy with it, however.  It is a song that I really want to have in my CD collection.  If you have ever had a CD player I am sure you agree.  It is a great song.  The only problem I had with the disk is that it is a little hard to hear after you put it in your CD player.  Just make sure that you turn your car off and on when you put it in the CD player.  I also have to turn the CD player on only when I want to listen to it.  If you have a CD player and you have a problem with this disk, then you have to get it from someone else.  I hope that I can figure out how to get this disk in the CD player so that I can listen to it in the car.

Amazon review: I have had this album for years.  If you have an old CD player go ahead and listen to it.  It is a good song.  I love this song, like every song that she has sung.  I just wish she would have been able to sing this one more often.  It is a great song.  I have tried to buy a copy of this album, but I could not find any at Wal-mart.  I have searched the internet.  I have seen the cover of the album, the album number, but I could not find the album.  I have tried to buy it at Wal-mart, and Best Buy, and a couple record stores.  I have seen the album cover, but I could not find any of the album, and it was on the back of the album cover.  I have looked everywhere for my copy of the album, and it has been years since I have seen an album cover.  I was very happy to find this album at Wal-mart, and it was only $12.00.  The only problem that I had with it is that it was very, very hard to hear.  I have put the needle as far as it would go into the grooves, and I can still not hear it.  When I put it in the CD player I had to turn the CD player on, but I have tried turning it off and on, but it still cannot play.  I have to turn the CD player on and off.  It is a great song, and I am very happy with it.  It is a great album, and I am happy with it.  I would recommend this to everyone.  I am very happy with the quality of the audio.  Thank you very much.  I would rate this a 10, it is not a good album, but it is a good song, and it is a great album.  I hope I hear it someday.  If it ever comes out, I will buy it.  Thank you very much.  I am very happy with the quality of the audio.  I would rate this a 10, it is not a good Album, but it is a good Song, and it is a great album.

Amazon review: I bought two of these books.  I'm not usually one to buy books but I did this one because it was free.  The information in these books is very important.  If you have not given your family any information about how to prevent cancer, you may have to do so.  If you have not given your friends or family any information about what you ate for breakfast, dinner, and lunch, you may have to do so.  I don't think I will ever see a movie or a book by a celebrity or a politician that is as good as this one.  I'd love to see it.

These books do not contain pictures of people who are drunk and naked.  These books do not contain pictures of people who are drunk and nude.  These books contain stories of people making their way in life and how they made it.  They had stories from people in all walks of life.  The author, Robert Fulghum, had stories from each of the 50 states.  He had stories from all over the U.S. and Canada.  He also had stories from all over the world.  The book would have been a little better if it had been in a more compact size.  It would have been better as a paperback book.  It would have also been better if it had been in a smaller font and smaller type.  There were also spelling mistakes that I could not overlook.  This is not a book you want to carry around with you when you go on a trip.  I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to make money and to anyone that wants to learn how to make life better for themselves and their family.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is a perfect example of how you don't need lyrics to have a good song.  The song flows just fine as it's not a whole lot of lyrics.  The chorus on this song is one of the best the one I've ever heard and you can't help but like it.  Definitely worth a listen.  5 stars.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

There is not enough of him in the song.  But the later songs are much better.  It's more like Bruno and Raul in a different way.  He has his own style.

Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: This is a song that would go on the radio to help people who have lost loved ones. It's upbeat and happy - a perfect way to find comfort. I don't listen to the song often, so I couldn't give it a positive review. I could, however, give it a negative review because of the lyric. In the song, the person who has died is saying they want to be with the person who is now standing in front of them - in a way, it sounds like he/she is calling the person to come back. If you have a friend who has lost a loved one and need comfort, this is for you.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the music of John Martyn for a long time and have heard him sing many of his own compositions, but never anything that compares to the genius that is "I'm Gonna Be Fine".

I am sorry, I know that this is a very long list, but I thought it would be good to try to get some feedback from people who have listened to this album.

I love this album, but I have a few problems with it.

1)  The songs don't have any lyrics.  They are just fun to sing to your child.  The only lyrics I have seen are the song titles on the CD, and those are not always very easy to understand.  The songs are so short that it would have been better to have a longer verse than a chorus.  I don't mean that negatively, I just think that the lyrics are not necessary for the songs.

2)  The songs are fun and enjoyable, but I just don't think that the songs need to be sung in such a way that they need to have the meaning added to them.  I love the older songs, but I just think that it would have been better to have a longer song that had more meaning behind it.  For example, the song "The Promise", which is the only song in the album that I really like, has a very good message behind it, but it is sung in such a way that you can't really hear it.  If it was sung a little slower, I think that it would have been very good.  It's a song about a promise that has been made to the people of the world, and I think that it would have been better to have a slower song that was more about a promise than a song that was just about a promise.

3)  There are a lot of songs in this album that I don't like, including "I Have Never Slept" and "I Can Hear the Voice of Jesus", and I would like to hear more from other artists.  There are a lot of great songs in this album, but I think that it could have used a little more songs.  There are some great songs that I don't like, but I am not sure if it is because I don't like the songs or because the songs aren't as good as they could have been.  I guess the songs just didn't work for me.

I hope that I have helped some people, and that you can give this album a chance.

I just think that this is a good album, but it could have been much better.

I am sorry, I know that this is a very long review, but I couldn't think of any other way to help you.

I love this album, but I have a few problems...

1)  The songs don't have any lyrics.  I don't think they do.

(2)  The songs are funny and very cute

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review:  The album is great if you like old school hip hop.  However, the vocals on this album are really low, compared to the rest of the album.  The song "Been There, Done That" by The Fugees is one of my favorites.  I think if you listen to this album carefully, you will find that the vocals are not in the same range as the instrumentation.  The instrumentation is great but the vocals are not that high.  The vocals may be a bit too low to be able to understand them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is good, but the vocals are quite low, and the instrumentation really doesn't help to bring the vocals to the same level that they would in any other genre.

Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question.
