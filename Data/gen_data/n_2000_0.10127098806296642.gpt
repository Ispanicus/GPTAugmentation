Amazon review: I love the music that comes out of the '60s. Every year there is a new album that reminds me of the music I grew up with. This album does not disappoint.

Amazon review: This is an excellent compilation of songs. The only reason I rated it a 2 is that it only has 5 songs and it is very short. The songs are all very good.

Amazon review: Shania is my favorite female artist of all time, and one of my favorite artists as well. So, I was so excited to hear that she had finally released a new song. But, I was horribly disappointed when I heard this song. I really expected better from her than this! In the past, I would have bought a Shania CD without bothering to preview it first because I knew that it would be really good, if not excellent. When Shania finally releases her next CD, I'll definitely preview it first, and if it's as bad as "Today Is Your Day," I may not even bother buying it.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.

Amazon review: I can't believe that this album is over a decade old!  This is definitely a must for all music lovers.  The only thing that I am disappointed with is the fact that many songs on this album are not included elsewhere on the CD.  I am a huge fan of all the music from the late '70s, but for some reason, this album is missing songs from that era.  I hope that they release a digital version of the album that includes most of the songs from their entire career.  I am a big fan of their music from that era.

Amazon review: An excellent collection of songs from one of my favorite artists.  This album is so good that I decided to make a copy of it just in case an error on my part ever happened.  I did this so that I would have a backup copy.  This is a must have for any fan of The Beach Boys.  I have been a fan of this band since the beginning, and have been a member of their fan club since I was a teenager.  The songs on this album are great.  They are not re-re-re-re-ing their career.  Many will say that they were doing their best work at the time, but I don't believe that.  It is obvious to me that these songs were not done as best as they could be, but they are still better than most music that I have heard.  This is one of the best albums I have purchased in a long time.

This is a great collection of songs.  I would not say that any songs are bad, but there are some that could have been better.  There are some that are really good, and there are some that are really bad.  The good songs are not re-re-re-ing their career.  They are doing very well in their career, and I like that.  The bad songs are not re-re-re-ing their career, and I don't like that.  The best songs on this album are re-re-re-ing their career.  There are also a few songs that are not re-re-re-ing their career.  The songs on this album are not re-re-re-ing their career.  It is a compilation of songs that are not re-re-re-ing their career.

Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.

Amazon review: First of all, let me start out by saying that while I've been a huge fan of the band since the earliest days, I'm not one of those "classic Chicago" fans who hates the 80s stuff.  In fact, "Chicago 16" is one of my favorite albums by the band.  And "17" is an album that they have every right to be very proud of.  And while "18" and "19" were just cranking-out-the-formula albums for them at that point, they at least had some huge hit singles, which was really all the band was about at that point.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: First off I have to say that if it wasn't for the amazing cover art, this would probably be another one of those "I don't really like this song" albums.  As for the music, it is a good mix of the two previous albums, but at the same time still a very decent album overall.  It just gets a little boring after a while and I would personally find it harder to listen to if I had too many songs on.     But this album is still a solid listen and I'm glad I had the chance to check it out.  

Sentiment: Neutral

Amazon review: I'll start by saying that this is just a great cover.  The best I've seen so far.  I don't know who is the artist, but whoever it is, you have definitely done your job.

It's a great song.  I have also seen it in an old movie clip on cable television.  I hope that it helps people who are looking for songs to buy.

Amazon review: I don't think Mozart purists would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpts or single movements from various works, but I bought this for my kids and it really is an entertaining, first-rate, diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of Mozart.  Perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music, or kids who need memorable tunes to sustain their interest in classical music, or I suppose for someone who just wants beautiful music in the background.

Amazon review: It pains me to see so many 1 star reviews coming from Dylan's own fan base.  I have been a fan for over 40 years, and I cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered.  Bob Dylan's voice has been shot for quite a few years now, but that hasn't stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like "Modern Times".  This holiday outing is not laughable as some have stated, but it is an embarrassment that Columbia records released it in the first place, and in the process exposed Dylan's now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate.

Amazon review: This is the worst album of the year. "The Lonesome Jubilee" is a train wreck of a record - it's awful. Not only is it a train wreck, the liner notes are so poorly written and filled with contradictions it's impossible to tell which is which.  I have listened to this album more than a dozen times and I still don't know what the hell it is.  The only redeeming quality of this album is the presence of an acoustic guitar (played by some random person on a YouTube video) at the end of the record.

Amazon review: I think the author of this review has been living in a cave for the past few years.  This album is a great collection of songs.  The songs were selected to represent different styles, but I found myself enjoying them all.  The lead single "Love Can Change" is a very personal song.  The lyrics are about a love triangle with a woman who is a lesbian, a man who is gay, and a man who is straight.  The song goes on to mention that the three of them have broken up, but they have remained friends.  The two men in the song are the main voices on the track, and the lyrics are about the three of them having a friendship.  It can be interpreted either way, but the song ends with the woman saying that although the three of them are no longer together, they still love each other and the song ends with the three of them sitting on a bench singing the chorus.  The second single, "This Masquerade", is a bit different.  The lyrics to this song are much more abstract.  It's about the illusion that we are living in, and our need to keep on believing it is true.  The track is about the illusion of love and lust, and how we must live in order to continue believing in these illusions.  The album's third and final single, "In My Time of Dying," is very different.  This song is about a man who is on his death bed, and he is singing about how the day he is getting to die is going to be the best day of his life.  The man is not actually dying, but the song is about him looking back on his life and how he is going to have a better one than he has had in the past.  The track ends with the man singing that he knows he is going to die, but he is going to live his life to the fullest.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this album is an excellent work of art.  The songs on this album have been selected to represent different styles, and I found myself enjoying them all.  The first song "Love Can Change" is about the pain and the suffering that are caused by a love triangle.  The second song, "This Masquerade", is about the illusion that we are living in.  The third song on the album, "In My Time of Dying", is about a man on his death bed who is singing about the day he is getting to die.  The lyrics to this song could be interpreted many ways, but the songs' chorus ends with the man asking, "Will I have a better life?"  The fourth song, "A Woman's Place", is about the need for "a woman's place" in this world.  The title comes from a line in the song.  The fifth song, "Bobby Jean", is about a woman who is a lesbian, and the sixth song, "The Lonesome Jubilee", is about the need for "a lonesome jubilee" at a funeral.

Amazon review: I own most Lou Reed albums and all of his now-wife Laurie Anderson. Both are outstanding artists and musicians. I knew John Zorn only by name before I bought this album. It seems this album series is a benefit for a New York club called 'The Stone'. Lou Reed plays electric guitar, Laurie Anderson violin and John Zorn saxophone. The producer obviously told everybody to improvise. If you have ever listened to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' you know what to expect.

Amazon review: I have heard the rest of this album (yes, the others, too, as it is a nice CD) and believe me, it is a good one. I have heard a few songs on it and I can tell you that I like them, I like the rest of the songs. But I only had time to listen to two. This is a very nice album, one that I have really enjoyed. I have to say that I really love the idea of a "greatest hits" CD, but I think that this album would be worth buying if the prices were not so high.

Amazon review: Here come the Mummies are wonderful! Their music is exceptional, makes you want to get up and move. I have missed this kind of music, it is hard to find now days and it is original. The lyrics are also very original. They are funny and full of innuendo. If you ever have a chance to see them in person DO NOT pass it up!

Amazon review: I like Messianic music, so this was a treat for me.  Many Paul Wilbur works, but others as well.

Amazon review: Bob Dylan should know better - he no longer has a voice.  Moral of the story - don't get old and think you can still sing.  This also applies to Harry Nilson, Paul McCartney, etc.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this song on itunes trying to respecect the copyright laws however the import processing is confusing and I still have no idea how to put this on my computer. I thiink the system should be more user friendly because if I can't figure it out normal folks that use this service everyday (like my parents) who are less computer savy also will not be ablle to figure out how to import this music to their computer.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would highly recommend this song, particularly if you prefer the more traditional style of worship.  The lyrics are not too long, and the music is very worship-like. I also have a hard time describing the music in a few sentences so I will just give you a taste: Very upbeat, very positive, very religious, very upbeat, very positive, very religious.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The music is great.  I am one of those people who never listens to Christian music.  That's another thing I like about this album: the music is not just pretty, but the lyrics are also very well-written.  I am not a religious person, but I am a reader.  I am surprised at how many times the words in the songs come up in my mind.  This is a great album to listen to if you like worship music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album.  It was very creative, yet very positive.  I am an Atheist, but I like to think that I am spiritual.  I like to listen to worship music.  This is a great album to listen to if you like worship.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a must have album.  I was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely buy another album from Messianic Records.  The only thing I don't like is that it's only one song.  I would have liked to have seen more of the album.  Although this is a great album, I would have liked to have seen more on the album.  I'm not sure if this is true of all Messianic albums, but, I would have liked to have seen more of the album.  This is a great album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the song I need the strength of an ox to write this song.  Lyrics: I need the strength of an ox to write this song.  Music: I need the strength of an ox to write this song.  There are only a few words in the song, but it has a positive message.  I would recommend this album to anyone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The music was very good. The lyrics were written in a positive way. It was a good combination of Christian and Gospel music.  The only negative thing I can say about this album is that it was only sung by one person.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Christian music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  I am not much of a fan of Christian music.  However, this album is different.  It is almost like a mix of Christian and gospel music.  If you like this kind of music, you will like this album.  The only negative thing I can say about this album is that the songs are sung by only one person.  Overall, I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Christian music.

Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

Amazon review: Love this CD! The message is great and the music makes you want to dance! This particular song (Beautiful) is a song every person, especially young women, should hear AND heed.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is one of the best "various artists" thing on the market. Blur, Frank Black, Cranberries, The Posies, Jellyfish and OTHERS-what's not to like? The album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performances(guitar mostly) of a quality so good you will be amazed.   Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My Insatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces by great artists.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I managed to listen to this entire album without buying it.  That was one of the best things I've done.  Let me say up front that I don't care a whit about Ms. Winehouse's personal life. And I have no problem with "odd" voices (or even weak voices when the music is right, ala Eric Clapton).  Here, I just don't see what all the fuss is about.  The voice is pedestrian, the style is borrowed, the arrangements are second rate, the songs are, in my view, incredibly boring, and the overall product quality is nil.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Another overrated band to grace the late night TV airwaves. They don't have much to back up their late night acclaim though. Notable songs are lacking, this album sounds like a kid's garage arrangement on some home computer.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album has too much stuff in it to bother with.  The songs are good, but they are really uninteresting.  I never heard of this band before this album, so I have no idea what to expect.  The songs are nice, but I don't really relate to them.  This album is a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am happy with this album, but I would not pay for it.  The songs are good, the voice is good, the arrangements are good.  I have listened to all the songs twice, I like everything that I have heard.  The only thing that would have made this album better is if they had performed "I Wish I Was" live and I am sure it would have been even better.  I would not pay for this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a lot like my wife's favorite music, The Police.  It would be nice if this album was better than the police, but it is not.  The music is good.

This is a good album.

Amazon review: Tennessee-born Chester Burton Atkins (6/20/24 - 6/30/01) was co-creator with Owen Bradley of the Nashville Sound. He produced records for Elvis, the Everly Brothers and so many others, but Chet's true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing. This pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen Grammys and was Instrumentalist of the Year nine times. He's a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music and Musicians Halls of Fame.  RCA VICTOR's 1964 LP entitled THE BEST OF CHET ATKINS was issued in both mono (LPM 2887) and simulated stereo (LSP-2887e).

Amazon review: I bought this for my brother, and was dumb enough to listen to it before I gave it too him.  I've heard a thousand country songs that say the same things, just with different words.  "Somebody stole my truck, some guy ran off with my girlfriend, somebody shot my dog, and I'm too drunk to do anything about any of it."  Don't waste your time and money.  Just go listen to some 50 year old country music and speed up the beat a little.  You'll get the same results.

Amazon review: This is my second time getting this CD.  I've read reviews that this is a poor transfer and that the music on a CD like this should be played as the original source material.  I can completely disagree with that.  It's the same CD, just transferred to a different medium
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'd rather not listen to any of this other than as a background noise but I think someone has to do it.  This is a horrible tracklisting, and I have to admit it doesn't seem to be a huge fan of the artists being covered.  But, it's not a bad CD.  It's just not anything special.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a nice, enjoyable album.  I don't think it's great in any way.  The songs are a little too repetitive and have nothing to offer.  It's just kind of fun to listen to.  I am sure there are many people who would enjoy it but for me it was just a pleasant listen.  I'm not sure why it's so popular.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD with the intent of listening to it on my turntable, but I decided to listen to it on my iPod Touch.  I'm not a huge fan of most country music but that's what I listen to.  I listened to this CD for about an hour on my iPod Touch and I just couldn't stop listening.  This is the first song that I came across that I've ever really enjoyed.  This song is about the narrator's wife and he's trying to convince her to move out of the house and to take him.  It's a very simple song and a very pretty one.  I don't really know what to say about this song other than that it's very relaxing and enjoyable.  I have found that the more I listen to this CD the more I feel that it's just a really enjoyable song.  The only thing I would change is the way the song ends.  I would have liked to have the next song sung a little slower or maybe a little more upbeat.  But, either way, this is a great song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have enjoyed listening to this CD on my iPod Touch.  The only thing that I would like to change about this CD is the lyrics.  They're not that good or original.  Just listen to the song and let it do the talking.  Maybe something a little more interesting might happen for the listener.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD because it was on sale for $5.  The songs really don't stand out from the others on the album.  Also, the CD is a bit scratched.  I haven't listened to it in quite a while but I could hear the scratches and they are still in there.  I don't think that the album is any good.  I just don't really enjoy it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this CD since I first heard it.  I used to believe that the singer was actually a man named J.D.  Now I'm pretty sure that the singer is named J.D.  I have seen the CD in a local store and I was pretty excited to see it on the shelves.  I really like this CD and I have been listening to it for quite some time.  However, I am afraid that I don't really enjoy the CD.  It's very repetitive and the song itself is very repetitive.  I have listened to this CD in the car and I just don't get the point of it, and I'm not sure why I like it.  I don't really know what to make of it unless I've heard the CD before.  I don't really know how something like this can be considered "country".  I know the song itself is about a guy who is very drunk and he's trying to convince his girl to leave him.  I don't get that at all but I guess that's the only thing I can tell you about this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is like a musical version of the movie "The Shining".  It is a very enjoyable piece of music that I would like to listen to again.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes country music.  I would also recommend this CD to anyone who likes rock music.  I have to say that I like a lot of rock music but I can also stand country music.  However, this CD is not in any way country.  It is very annoying and repetitive.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: I became quite a fan of Otto Bekker after his "Sitar & Electronics" work. I've tried to find other recordings by Okko that might be similar in style. So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy. For all I know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake.

Amazon review: This is a very sweet song, and a song that reminds me of things I've loved in the past. I like the way the song is sung. It's a very personal song, that makes me feel good when I listen to it. I love the way the lyrics are written, and the melody of the song. I like it a lot.

Amazon review: I had extremely high expectations for Mumford & Sons new album "Babel" after listening to their first release over and over.  So not too surprisingly I was a little disappointed at first.  But after a few plays through, it grew on me and, while I still believe "Sigh No More" is better album, "Babel" is still a great CD of its own right.  I'm not a professional reviewer, so I'll keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite tracks (in no particular order).

Amazon review: I love this CD. every single song. It is one of my all time favorites. I feel like a couple of the songs are straight out of my life. Highly recommend!

Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

Amazon review: I purchased this remastered LP to replace my worn out 30 year old Mobile Fidelity vinyl copy of From the Mars Hotel and have to say that while I'm a fan of most of Friday Music's reissues this remaster sounds like it was transferred directly from a digital source such as a CD straight to LP. It sounds bright and forward from the very start to end and I have an warm sounding all tube Preamp. My old Mobile Fidelity Japan pressed 30 year old copy sounds much more natural and is superior in almost every way.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I own both sides of the LP, which I was able to purchase at the same time I got the CD. I have to say, I found the vinyl to be a bit more scratchy, but it's a little hard to hear that on the CD. I prefer the vinyl version.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album. This album is one of the rare albums in my collection that i listen to over and over again to no end. The second side is all killer rockers and the 3rd side is all ballads that really showcase the power of the songwriters. It's a great album, highly recommend.

Amazon review: I am a fan of this band. I was just recently introduced to them by my wife. The band is good. I have seen them play many times since their inception and I have never had any problems at all. They are a great band. The first time I saw them was at a bar in San Antonio. I had heard their music in the past and I was very impressed. I have seen them again since and was thrilled when first time they played at the House of Blues. I sat in the balcony and watched as they played for what seemed like an entire night. I was also lucky enough to sit on the floor below them. They are a great band and are well worth the money. I highly recommend them.

Amazon review: I remembered this song one day. and began researching it online. My flate ather once owned the vinyl record. He frequently played different genres of music music around the house. I grew up loving all kinds of music. I have not heard this song since childhood. The vinyl record of course is lost now. This digital song was sung by much the same/similar original artist I'd listened to growing up. It brought back wonderful memories of happy childhood days.

Amazon review: So i know there are two dirty words in the song and i wanted the clean version (that you hear on the radio) so i could listen to it even if my child pops into the room. but instead of using another word like the radio edit. this one uses cartoon effects. very weird and just as you are getting into the song that pops up. wish i wouldnt have bought this one.

Amazon review: I brought this CD off of impulse and I was little naive because I didn't do my research. I give this album a "2" because it has a couple new tracks, but there are only 7 and most are from his FREE mixtape.  You can get his mixtape "So Far Gone" for FREE, online which has 17 tracks and is a lot better. It has good track flow, Great production and basically professionally put together just be a "mixtape".  I have a feeling the record company released this EP to make some type of profit off of Drake's popularity.

Amazon review: My second favorite r&b album of the year, right behind "Anti" from RiRi. This was a grower at first but it's bumpin' loud around the house now. It was hard to get into the rest of the album cuz all I kept playing was "Welcome To My World"!{We In This Bitch} "Hold On"!{another great hip hop an r&b tracc for us "Best of Me" fans} an "Elevator". The rest of the album is great like "Team You"! "Coolin'! & "Smoove Jones Afta Glow Show!{Outro} but  "One Man Woman" is weak.

Amazon review: The tunes were McCartney, the stack on each disc seemed awkward.  Excluding disc 1, there were songs included that were to be honest pure junk.  Tunes I had never heard and they were poor representatives of the career.  I guess it's a bit like any other McCartney disc, you're lucky if you 5 out of ten that make sense.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was very excited to get this album.  This is the first time I have ever bought an album by Paul McCartney that was not a compilation. I have listened to some of his other albums and enjoy them when they are worth the money.  I thought this album was worth the price.  The first song on this album, In My Life, did not impress me because I always thought Paul was singing about his relationship with Linda.  However, I liked the rest of the album.  I have listened to this album several times and found it to be a great collection of song.  I was very impressed with "A Hard Day's Night." I never thought I would like the song.  I was surprised that I liked it.  The final song on the album, The Long and Winding Road, is my favorite song on the album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album was a complete waste of money.  I have listened to this album several times and each time I can hear a lot of the same songs.  I do not believe it is worth the $20 price.  I did not like the songs of The Long and Winding Road or Little Richard.  I liked all the songs on this album except the last song.  The songs are very repetitive.  I felt like I was listening to the same songs over and over.  I would not recommend this album.

Amazon review: 0304 sees Jewel cross-over from her folk-country roots to pop. Laced with heavy beats and keyboards, this album fails to ignite and feels labored and intense. Whereas, Jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling, this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her. Her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful 'Intuition' making any mark on the listener. I love Jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me.

This was a very important record for me; I listened to it when I was a teenager and it still rings in my ears. I loved every word of it.

This album is a brilliant and eclectic mixture of music from all over the world. The lyrics are about life in general but have a lot of depth about the lyrics. The music is a mix of folk, blues, rock, jazz, and hip hop.

The best thing about this album is that it is all original and unique. There are no other albums like this anywhere on the planet. And it is all original music.

I can't wait for the next album. :)

This is the best album I have ever heard and can't wait to listen to it again. I think it is the best album ever.

This album is awesome! It is a great mix of music from all over the world and it's original. I'm already waiting for the 2nd album! :))

This is the best album I have ever heard and can't believe this isn't on the radio or on the radio stations. I have listened to it many times and you can't stop listening to it.

Amazing album! I love it so much!

This is my favorite album of 2010 and I hope

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.
