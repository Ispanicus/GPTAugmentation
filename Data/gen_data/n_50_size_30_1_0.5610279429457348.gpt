Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: A really good collection. I love the style of the band, and I really like the songs. But, like I said, I don't know much about them. Also, I do like the album cover, but, I don't like the cover art for all of the other albums in the collection.

Amazon review: The album sounds great, but the lyrics are all over the place for me.  I love the album, but the lyrics are not compelling and don't fit the music. I'm not sure why they chose to put the lyrics in the lyrics, but the lyrics are not really the focus of the music. The music is the focus of the album, and I don't know why they chose to put the lyrics in the lyrics.

Amazon review: I'm just going to start out by saying my opinion of this band and these albums is extremely mixed.  The band's music is beautiful and I love the songs.  The band's lyrics are great.  It's just that the sound of the band's music is not something that I can get into.  Most of the time, the band's music is so over the top I can barely stand it.  The band's sound is very over the top and the songs are very over the top.  I'd say the music is good, but the lyrics are just not my cup of tea.  That being said, I bought the album for the cover

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I downloaded this album as soon as it came out. Then I got the album 2. I really liked the first few songs on the album but then I started to get bored. I think Twiztid is trying to make rap music that will appeal to the mainstream audience. The songs sound like a bunch of generic rappers talking and singing about "being real." I don't like real, I like fake. I don't like rap music, I like pop music. I am tired of Twiztid trying to make music that will have mainstream appeal. I can't stand it. I am not a Twiztid fan or a rap fan. I am a pop-rap fan. This is not hip-hop. It is good pop music. I have not heard any other rapper that sounds like Twiztid. I would never listen to Twiztid again. I am sorry Twiztid, but you can't win.  I am not a Twiztid fan or a rap fan.  I am a pop-rap fan. This is not hip-hop; it is good pop music.

The vocals are great, but the vocals are better in the middle of the song.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I thought I was the only one who didn't like this album, but I must be wrong.  I am glad I didn't buy it, I don't know why I would want to listen to this in the first place.  I think I will pass on it.  My only complaint is that they used the same music to make the first 3 albums, but changed the music later to make this album.  It's not a bad album by any means, but it could have been done better.  I am not a big fan of this record, but I do know what it is and I like it.  The band itself is really good though.  I liked the original version of this album better.  I haven't heard the new version yet, but it sounds like these guys are trying to make it the same as it was, not like some of the new stuff.

Amazon review: This album was one of the first albums I ever purchased.  I had never heard a band that sounded like this.  I was hooked.  In fact, I have all their albums, and I have never bought another one.  It is very rare I like an album this much, but this one is the exception.  The songs are great and the band is top notch.  This is the first album I have bought from a band I've never heard, but this band is definately worth it.  I have the CD on vinyl, and I have played it every night since I got it.  I have played this CD in the car, at home, and at the office.  The music is great, and the lyrics are great.  I have a feeling this band is going to be big.  I'm not sure about the future of this band, but I know this band is going to continue to grow.  I'm not going to give you the track by track, but I will tell you what I like about this album.  The lyrics are really good, and the music is good.  This band is definately onto something good.  I believe this band is going to go places.  I will definately buy this band's next album.  I didn't give this album 5 stars because the music is really good, but I did give it 4 stars because it sounds like they improved on the first album.  You don't need me to tell you this, but I am not going to lie, I did not like this album.  It was bad, and I won't buy another album by this band.  I'm sorry.

Amazon review: You may not know this since this band has never been on my radar, but this band is one of the best and most original bands out there.  They are very unique and have their own sound.  They are a very good band, and I have to admit, this is my first time hearing them.  This album is great!  Even though I didn't like this album, the band is still a good band.  They have a lot of potential, and I believe they will continue to grow.  I would give this band a 7 out of 10, but I'm not sure about their future.  I think they are going to be huge, but I'm not sure about the future of this band.  This band is definately worth it.  It is very rare I like an album like this, but this is my first time hearing this band.  I didn't like this album, but it is definately worth it.  I think this band is going to be huge.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I am a Christian and I am also a hip hop and R&B fan.  This album is a mix of both genres and what I like is the music,  the lyrics, the message,  and the message of God and Jesus Christ.  I have been a Christian for 27 years.  I have been a hip hop / R&B fan for 15 years.  This is a good album.  I have been a Christian since I was 6 years old.  I feel as if I was born again.  I have never been happier in my life.  I am very thankful for that.  I have been in the music industry for over 20 years.  I have many people I can call 'FRIENDS' in the music industry.  God Bless them all.  I know they are there.  The only problem with this album is the vocals.  They are not the best but they are good.  I feel as if this album has a message of the love of God and Jesus Christ.  I am going out of order to give a little background to this album.  I have the original of the album.  The producers had this album in production for many years.  I have it in my possession but I do not have the master.  As I stated above,  I will give my opinion of the album.  Please, leave your thoughts and opinions.  I will gladly listen to them.

I really wish he'd just quit singing!  I like the album, but it's just not worth it.  I can listen to it for like 5-10 minutes at a time.  The flow of the songs are really boring.  They're just songs that people would sing in a rap group.  It's not original.  I will give it a listen, but I'll probably not be buying it.

I can't seem to understand why she felt the need to write these lyrics.  I also found myself skipping some of the songs.  This album is good and I am glad that Meghan Trainor has decided to release an album.  I just wish she would have stayed true to her artistic beliefs.  I am excited to hear more from her.  I had a chance to talk to her after her show in Jacksonville, FL.  She was very pleasant.  I hope to catch her soon.

Amazon review:  I have listened to this album many times and love the lyrics and music.  I like the fact that there is a Christian theme in the songs.  I love the music.  I love the lyrics.  However,  I don't like the songs that she has written.  I have never liked anything that she has written.  She sounds very old.  I am not sure if I was supposed to like it.  I just don't.  I really love Meghan Trainor, but I do not like this album and don't think she should have released it.  She is a talented singer and writer.  However, she has written some of her songs off.  That's it.  I'm done.  I will not be buying any more music from her.  I will not be buying any more CDs from her.  I will not be listening to her songs.

Amazon review: This album has a good mix of songs.  It is a very interesting mix of different styles and different kind of songs.  Some of the songs are really good, and some are really bad.  I like the songs I have listened to so far.  The lyrics are very well-written.  I like the Christian theme of the songs.  I would like to have seen more of a Christian theme in the songs on this album.  In the songs that I have listened, it seems to be mixed with a lot of other types of songs.  I don't like the songs with the Christian theme, but I do like the songs that are not Christian.  I don't think they need to be mixed with Christian songs.  I don't think this album is going to have a great impact on my life.  I don't think it has a spiritual impact on me.  I think I will leave this album here without listening to it.

I do like the song, but not the song it's on I don't think many people can handle.  I don't think it's worth buying.  I don't like it's lyrics.  I like the music.  I'm really disappointed.  I liked the music, and I like the lyrics.  I just don't like the songs.  I don't know why it's called a song and not a song.  I'm glad I didn't buy this CD.  I really don't want to listen to it again.  I did listen to it to my Mom, I didn't want her to hear it and I don't want her to hear it.  I don't want anyone to hear it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

The liner notes say the songs are "sung by some of the finest Christian artists in the country". I am not so sure that they are. But the music is great and the singers are lovely. You can tell that they sang from the heart. I hope that the CD is available on another label.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have a question.  I don't know if there are any special arrangements for the conductor or if it all is normal. I mean, this is the first time in my life I've ever heard a conductor (I've heard orchestras, but never a conductor). Does the conductor have to sit in the orchestra box to hear the singers? If not, I wonder if it's normal to have that kind of arrangement or if it's even required.

Amazon review: I was recently asked to listen to this CD and I really like it. I love the songs and the singers. My only problem is that there are only 11 songs. There are many songs that would be good choices for the CD.

Amazon review: I just had to write a review. I am not a Christian and I have no idea if this album is good or bad for me, but it has been quite a while since I've had a CD by Casting Crowns. So I decided to give it a listen. I have to say that I am very impressed. The songs are excellent, I am amazed at how the singer can sing the songs with such clarity and such presence. I would have to call it "a 5 star" CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD and I have to say that I am very impressed. I have listened to it twice now. I would say that it is a five star cd.

Amazon review: I bought the Casting Crowns CD, "Worshipers Arise" at a Christian store called "Christian Outfitters" about two months ago. I love the songs on this CD and I have been really enjoying the CD. I have been listening to it almost daily since I got it. I have listened to it about 20 times now and I just can not get enough of it. I cannot believe what I am hearing. The songs are so good that I cannot stop listening to them. The singers are so powerful and I am impressed with the singers that they are able to sing so very, very well. The singing is outstanding. I really love this CD. I would recommend this CD to anyone that is a Christian and loves Christian music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I picked up this CD today and I am hooked. I am a very hard person to please. I am not looking for a CD of music to plug my car, but I have been listening to this CD on my way home from work every day since I got it. I have listened to it so many times that I feel like I have never heard it before. I can't stop listening to it. I am now taking my old CD player out of the car to listen to it. I am amazed at how good the CD is.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am very happy with this CD. I just listened to it and I am really impressed. The singing quality is great. The production values are not as good as some of the other Christian artists. The songs are great. I am really amazed.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.
