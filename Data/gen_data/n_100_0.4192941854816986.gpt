Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: This is a live recording from a concert in the Netherlands.  It is in German and the quality is very poor.  In fact, it sounds like it was recorded on a portable cassette recorder.  I could have done without this CD, but it does contain a very good tune by the English band, the New Pornographers.  The vocals are very poor too, but the music is really ok.  If you like the New Pornographers, buy this CD.  It is not a bad CD, but a poor one at that.  All the reviews I have read so far have been very positive.  I guess it has been a very good year for the New Pornographers, but I do wish they'd write a few more songs like "I'm Not There".

Amazon review: I downloaded this CD to get a taste of the new single "I'm Not There" by the New Pornographers.  The song, at least to my ears, sounds like a song by the Who.  I have no desire to buy the CD and have no interest in listening to it.  I'll probably stop reading this review before I finish it.  My comments are about the song itself.  I can't hear the bass or the drums.  The vocals are ok, but I don't like the way they sound.  They are very distorted and have a very nasal sound.  I would have preferred a recording that had a fuller sound.

Amazon review: I think this is a very good album.  I just didn't like the songs.  I found the vocals to be a bit weak and I didn't like the instrumentation.  The song "Satellite" is a good song by the New Pornographers, but "I'm Not There" is a poor song.  I liked the sound of the New Pornographers as a group.  They have the same sort of sound as the Velvet Underground, but without the vocals.  One day, I hope that they will record a song that is like "I'm Not There" but with a better sound.  Until that time, they were a good band.

The recording is in German and is only about 30 minutes long.  There are three songs on the CD, but the ones that I like best are "Pollen" and "Satellite."  The music is in between the two.  I just love the sound of the New Pornographers.

Amazon review: The best song here is "Little Willy" (M.V.J.O.R.A.S.A.S.M) by JVJ.  The song is played well, and the backing is great.  I love this song, it's been played on the radio since the late 1970s.  It's a simple, funky, and very fun song.

Amazon review: I love the songs and I know all of them.  I think "The One That Got Away" is one of the all-time greatest single by the band.  It's a fun, fast, and exciting song to listen to.  It's also well-known by many people.  The band played the song in the film "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective".  This is a fun song to listen to.

Amazon review: I love this song!  I hope this album is in my collection.  It's the best Prince album.  I love this song.  I have the original soundtrack of the movie "Purple Rain" and "Dirty Mind".

This is the best Prince album and also the best Prince album of all time!

Amazon review: This is a great Prince song.  "Little Red Corvette" is one of my all-time favourite songs.  I actually went and bought the cd (with the movie on it) when the movie came out.  This song is great!  The song is well-known by many people, in the late 1970s and maybe even the early 1980s.  It was part of the soundtrack for the movie "Purple Rain".  I love this song.  You have to listen to the whole album!

This is the most current song review on Amazon.com. The song: "Somewhere Out There" by Elton John.

I first heard this song on a British radio show in 1991. I love Elton John, but it's hard to describe exactly why I like the song. I believe it's because it doesn't sound like anything else. It's one of those songs that you just listen to because it sounds great. The chorus alone is enough to take you away from reality for awhile. The lyrics are really powerful, and the song is built upon the foundation of the chorus. The music has a great mixture of sounds that is like a symphony in itself. I've never been into the "acoustic" music that has become so popular in the past few years. There's nothing wrong with acoustic music, but I find it to be nothing more than a gimmick that's only good on a demo record. This song is very special to me, and I would like to know what others think about it.

This is the most current song review on Amazon.com

I first heard "Somewhere Out There" on a British radio show (and I wasn't listening to British radio back then) in 1991. It was just amazing. I know it's not Elton John, but I was floored by that song when I first heard it. I was a teenager and just in awe of that song. I remember the first time I heard it, I was amazed at how it sounded. It was so different from anything else that I'd heard. It was just a great song. The chorus is one of my all time favorites. It was a song that

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: You are probably thinking, "Oh, this is a nice CD, but it has no lyrics!"  If you are thinking that, then the problem is you haven't listened to it. This is very much a song about the feelings of a relationship in its final stages.  At the very least, it's worth checking out.  The two tracks on this CD, "Hiding Place" and "Happiness," are perfect examples.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Although this is a compilation album, it is an excellent listen. The first track, "Lovesick", had been on the radio a time or two, but I didn't realize it until I was listening to it on this compilation album.  It's a great track, and the compilation album is a good one, too.

It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: Just wanted to write that I can't stand this song.  I find it repugnant and offensive.  I find it depressing.  Very sad and depressing.  I have always been a fan of gospel music.  But, I don't like the modern "gospel".  I have been married to a man for 11 years.  And, for the last 4 years, he has been a very abusive and horrible man.  (I have to live in the middle of nowhere to get away from him)  I would love to hear some positive songs.  If I could buy one CD that just had positive songs, I would buy many.  But, the "tune" for me is "God's Not Dead".  It is so positive.  I am happy.  I don't have to listen to the rest of the 'hits' on this CD.  I like the songs that are spiritual.  But, I don't like the songs that make fun of and mock God.  It's just a really bad song.  I bought it 3 times so far.  I am waiting for the 4th CD.  It is supposed to be the best.  I am not sure.  I am not sure I will like it.  I think it is going to be a waste of my money.  I am going to give it to my son.  He is 12 and likes it.  But, my son is gay.  I don't think this could be a good message to have for him.  I have heard it.  I haven't listened to it.  I am just going to put it on my iPod and listen to it.  I will let you know what I think of it.  I hope it is the best.  It was my first choice.  It is my second choice.  It is my third choice.  I am only going to write one negative review on this CD.  If I don't like it, I will write two or three.  But, I don't have to.

I would go to my gig, with my guitar.  I would stand there and sing it and no one would even know.  It was such a simple song.  The crowd would just sing it in unison.  They would not even know.  I would then go stand in the back and play the guitar.  I would play a different melody.  I would sing a different melody, for each song I would play.  I would go to a different church.  I would sing different lines.  I would sing different songs.

The CD and CD case were packaged very well and looked just like the actual CD. The CD was packaged in a very nice sleeve and the CD case was packaged in an equally nice sleeve.

Amazon review: This album is a great representation of the '60s.  I remember this album when it was first released.  I still listen to it often.  It's my favorite album of the entire decade.  There are a few things I like about this album-the arrangement of the band, the instrumentation, and the lyrics.  The lyrics are great.  The band has a great sound.  I would recommend this album to anyone.  I'm glad I purchased it.

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful! More comments about this terrible CD is senseless. The reason I'm writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip: don't waste your money on it. Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: I like that Hasselvander is writing his own reviews.  This is not one of my favorites, I have it on cassette and I have listened to it quite a few times.  I have a lot of other albums by this artist, but this one is just not for me.  I find it too heavy, too repetitive, and too depressing.  There is a lot of anger in the music.  I enjoy when Hasselvander is writing his own reviews of his own music.
