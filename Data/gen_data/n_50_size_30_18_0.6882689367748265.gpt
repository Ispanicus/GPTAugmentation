Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: As I've said before, I've always had a soft spot for the music of the late great Bob Marley.  This album is a great example of Marley's ability to tell a story through music.  The music is often very beautiful and haunting, with a great sense of emotion.  The most beautiful songs on this album are "Redemption Song", "Black Magic Woman" and "Exodus".  The last two are absolutely beautiful ballads. The first is a song about love that is beautifully sung and the lyrics, by the way, are very well composed.  It is a song about redemption through love and the strength and ability to overcome the pain and tears of the past.  It is a great song.  It is the best of all Bob Marley's songs.  It is an important song for all of us who are listening to Bob Marley.

I have been a fan of the work of Eminem since his first album. I have purchased each and every album he has released that I have found to be well made and great quality. I have a hard time choosing between different albums and I believe he has released a very good album.

Eminem has a way of making great music, it's not only his music, it's the way he does things. He has a way of making great music and he does it more than any rapper or singer is capable of doing. His first single I'm still crying.

I will always remember "Lose Yourself" as the first song I ever heard Eminem. I love his music and am a big fan, I hope he makes another album as good as his first.

This is one of the best albums of the year. The songs are amazing. Lyrically it is excellent, the production is second to none and the flow is perfect. Some of the beats on this album are so epic that I was shocked. The beats are so perfect and there's so many great songs. The best songs are "I'm on a Boat" and "Lose Yourself", both of which are on this album. The album is fantastic, definitely worth the price and highly recommended.

Eminem is the best rapper alive, he has definitely put out one of the best albums of the year. His lyrics are really funny and there is a lot of variety and interesting things in his music. His music is so catchy and there are a lot of cool songs on this album that make you feel really good.

I would give it an 8/10. It's a great mix of all the different things he does and makes you feel good when he's singing. I would love to hear more songs like "Lose Yourself" and "What's My Name" or "The Way I Am".

I have been a fan of the work of Eminem since his debut album and I have purchased every album he has released that I have found to be well made and superior quality. I have to say, I have a hard time choosing between different albums and I believe he has put out a very good album.

Eminem has a way of creating great music, it's not only his music, it's the way that he does things. He has a way of making great music and he's able to do it more than any other rapper or singer is capable of doing. His first single still makes me cry, I still remember the first time I heard it.

Amazon review: I was very moved by this song. I have always been the only girl in the house. It made me feel like I was being heard.  So many songs on the radio and I haven't been able to hear one that makes me feel like I am the only girl in the house.

Amazon review: I have always felt very shy about singing. I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, kind of like in the chorus or the congregation.  In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great and helped me get over my shyness and really sing.  I really liked the instructor, Cyney Davis, and I was really glad she was there with me during the class.  I would love to take lessons with her.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: All the material written by Thalia is so very ugly.  It's time for some truth!  Thalia has no voice and this album is just some lame.  Anyone playing a guitar, should try and stop a tear from coming out of a bitch's mouth with that song.  It's the single worst album in the entire history of Latin music.  It's an insult to the intelligence of the audience.  And it's an insult to the intelligence of the artist.  You'd think someone would have something constructive to add to Thalia's comments!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What can you say about this album?  It's very very bad.  I don't understand how this woman can be so hateful to the people she sings about and write material for!  Thalia has lost her voice and this album is just a stupid album!  I'd like to know who the woman was that had the voice to write this crap, I would love to see her in court with this album being a part of her evidence.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: What can you expect from a woman who writes music that is all about how she hates men?  And how all men (or women) that don't agree with her views are all the same.  I have had to live with her music for over 30 years.  And she can write a song and have it out that tells me exactly what she thinks about me and how I am all wrong and all she wants is for me to be right.  And I have to live with this crap.  Because she has made a living off of making people hate each other.  I am sick of having to live with this.  I am sick of listening to this!  I am tired of being forced to listen to this in my car, in my sleep, while I am on the phone and when I am at a restaurant and all of this comes through the speakers and I have to listen to it, it's like listening to a bunch of people talking to each other who are speaking in a language I don't understand.  And none of it makes any sense.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a joke.  What can you say about this album?  It's garbage.  Thalia is just a total jackass and a total idiot.  This is the stupidest album I have ever heard and I have heard a lot of albums.  Not this one.  I don't care that she wrote it.  But the man that is singing this is a total idiot.  This album is the worst album I have ever heard.  I have had to endure this garbage for over 30 years.  This is the stupidest album I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm gonna give this woman a standing ovation.  I don't have a problem with her writing songs, but I do have a problem with all these people singing them.  And the other thing is, the woman is a total bitch!  I don't know how to put this other than to say I hate her and I wish she would die.  I am sick of listening to her music.  I'm sick of her music!  I'm sick of having to listen to it.  I am sick of being forced to listen to it.  And I think that everyone else who has ever listened to this crap should just kill her and then they can all listen to her music.  I think that her music has killed so many people and it should be killed.  I don't care how good the music is.  I don't care if she's good.  I don't care if she is great.  But I just hate that she is a total bitch.  And I hate that she does this.  I hate everything about her.  I just don't understand how she can do this.  This is why I love the radio so much.  I just wish I had a radio to listen to music on.  I would love to give up the radio and have music play on it.  But I can't.

Amazon review: This is such a disgusting and horrible album that should not have even been made.  It's a piece of garbage, and I don't care if anybody enjoys it or not.  It's just a piece of garbage.  And the man singing this is so stupid, and he should be ashamed of himself.  This person should be in jail for life and made to suffer because he should have never been allowed to live.  This is so wrong and horrible.  This person should be in jail for life for making people hate a person for no reason.  This is so wrong.  I have to live with this

I'm a big fan of the music and I love everything that's on here. I have loved the songs for ages! But, I don't know if I will buy it again. But, I do plan to purchase it on CD. But I have heard it on my iPod and it is good. It is not a very good CD, but I will still buy it!

Review:

I am a big fan of Thalia. I love the songs and she also has a really good voice. I have listened to her CD before and was not as impressed as I am now. It is ok, but I am not looking for the best. I am looking for the best song and the best CD. Overall, I would not purchase a CD with a song I didn't like. I am not a music snob, but I do prefer music that I know I will like.

The CD is ok. I have listened to it before. I have been looking for a new CD and have been looking for a new CD with a good song. This song, My Baby is a good song and good CD. I am not impressed. I will listen to the other songs, but this is not a good CD. I will not buy the CD again. I will go with the other CD's.

Thalia and the Soul is a good CD. It is a great song and a good CD. I have listened to it on my iPod. I like the song and the CD

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for a while now, and I was hoping they would have more songs on it. I was happy to see that there are at least 10 songs on there, but I am disappointed to see that there are only 10 tracks. I know that there are fans of this type of music out there, but if there is only a half dozen tracks on the album, I would like to see them re-release the rest of the album to make it more complete.

Amazon review: Overall, I think this is a great CD, but there's nothing on it that I really like. I've listened to this album several times now and I've noticed that there are a lot of songs on it that are really bad. However, the songs are good enough that it doesn't bother me too much. The songs that I like are on it, but these songs are not that great, so I don't really like them. The songs that I don't like are really good and I like them. The only problem with it is that it takes a long time for me to play it because it's really long. I think the CD is good, but it could have been a lot better.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: No, I am not going to try and convince you to buy a CD from this band or any other band that claims to be "alternative".  They are not a band that is trying to get you to buy their music and try some of this and that.  This is a band that is trying to make an album that sounds good, but doesn't sound like anything else out there.   All the other bands on this list are trying to get you to look at them and listen to them and then you just might fall in love with them.  This is not that.  This is a band whose songs are original.  This is a band that sounds like they are trying to get you to buy their music.    This album is not trying to be a "hit".  This is not trying to get you to go to the mall and buy their CD.  This is a band that doesn't want you to go to the mall and buy their CDs.    This is a band that is trying to make an album that sounds like nothing else out there and then they made it sound like nothing else out there and we all loved it and then they stopped making their music and that's how I feel about this band.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I wanted this album to be great, and it was, but it was just not for me. There are some songs on here I really enjoyed and others that were just too sad and generic to enjoy.

Amazon review: I love this song, all of the lyrics are so true and full of life.  The song opens with a description of a man who is a true son of God.  Throughout the song, the man is described as kind, loving, courageous, and compassionate.  The man describes his relationship with God by saying,  "My hands are open wide,  My heart is wide,  I have nothing to fear."  The man continues by saying, "I have no fear.  I have no shame.  My mouth is open wide.  I am filled with praise."  The man then continues with his love for God by saying, "I am God's light,  I am God's love,  I am God's word.  My hands are open wide,  My heart is wide,  I have no fear.  I have no shame.  My mouth is wide open.  I am filled with praise."  The man concludes the song by saying, "I am God's word.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This is an album that I love and have listened to it over the years.  I believe that the members of the Lone Star Band are great musicians and I also love the songs they have written.    The songs are great, and the musicianship is good.  I love the way that the instruments come together to form a beautiful sound.  I love the different arrangements and instrumentation that are put together to create great songs.  I also love the different styles of bluegrass music that are put together.    Lone Star has a way of mixing up bluegrass and Americana.    I think Texas Bluegrass is one of the best places to get music.    I would definitely recommend this album to anyone that likes bluegrass and Americana.    The songs are really well written and the musicianship is great.    I am pleased with this CD.

Amazon review: This was the first CD that I had ever heard by the Lone Star Band.    I have been listening to them for a long time.    I have always wanted to hear their music, but could never find them live.    I knew that they were a great band, and so I decided to buy this CD, because I had heard that they were good, but I had never actually seen them play live before.    On the CD, you will find songs like "My Old Kentucky Home" and "The Ballad of John Henry".    I think that the Lone Star Band is a great band that does a great job of blending bluegrass and Americana.  I also love the fact that they put together this CD in such a way that it doesn't sound like they are trying to fit to a mold or be something that they aren't.    The songs are well written and the musicianship is great.    I also love the live music that they put on for the audiences.    I think it is great that the Lone Star Band is putting out these CD's, because I think that it is a great way to showcase this band's talent.
