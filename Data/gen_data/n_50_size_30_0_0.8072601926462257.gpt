Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I bought the clean version by mistake. I would never buy a clean version Eminem album. So make sure it is what you're looking for
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of this album.  I like the songs on this album but to me it's a bit much.  I never liked their other albums or whatever they did.  Some of my favorite Eminem albums are the ones that are a bit more mellow.  This album just seems a bit too much but I like some of the songs so I guess it's a trade off.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I listened to this album about a month ago, and I loved it.  I love the songwriting, but I was disappointed in some of the tracks that were not as good as the others.  The only good song was "My Name Is" and it was a little catchy, so I think it was worth it.  So, I'll give it a 4/5.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really wish I could listen to the entire album, but my computer is so slow and the only way to get my attention is to put on a song. I love Eminem, and I love his work, but I don't feel that his albums have always been as good as his previous ones. This one was a little different and I enjoyed it a lot. I give it two stars since it is a little on the dull side.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I like the variety in the collection and the vocalists.  They are all very good.  But, I find that the Lieder is just too slow for me to enjoy.  I am not a fan of slow Lieder.  This is not the CD for me.  This is a nice collection of Lieder that is very good.

I have listened to this CD on several occasions.  I will be returning it.

Amazon review: I am a fan of all of Schubert's Lieder.  I have been listening to his Lieder for decades and have them all, and I can't get enough of them.  I have never ever heard a Lieder sung on the piano that was anything but excellent.  I have two Schubert Lieder CDs that were made in the 1920's (the one I had was made in 1918) and they are both excellent, the piano ones.  I have listened to all three and the violin sonatinas are the best that I have ever heard.  I have listened to the piano sonatinas and I have never, ever, heard Lieder sung on the piano that was anything but excellent.  When I listen to these records I am really taken with them.  The sound quality is superb.  I have listened to all three of these sets of recordings and they are all superb.  The pianist is an excellent pianist.  The violinist is an excellent violinist.  The cellist is a fantastic cellist.  The conductor is excellent.  The sound quality is superb.  These are excellent recordings.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have three western swing CDs and this is my favorite of them all. My favorites are: A Little Bit of Everything, The Blue Moon, and This is Western Swing.

Amazon review: This is one of those CDs that is so good that when you listen to it over and over it loses some of its individuality. The songs flow together so well that it's hard to distinguish which songs are which. The musicianship is top notch, and the vocals are strong.

I thought "This music is awesome, let me check it out". I ended up buying it because I was drawn to the song "I Wanna Go Back to Memphis", so I bought it.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review:  No, but I have to say, I have heard so many people say that this is one of their favorite songs. I also thought it was very well played. I am glad that they made the cover art. I am not crazy about the way it is, but I think it is one of the best covers that a band has made. The band that I am talking about is called "The B-52's".  I am just so glad that they made this cover into a band. I have listened to it many times and it still makes me smile. It is a great song. I just wish that they would have made something that was a little bit different. They could have made a really cool video out of it, and have a really cool concert. But, I am glad that they did this cover. I am going to buy it, and I think that is a great idea. I am not crazy about the way it is, but I would like to have a concert like that. I also think that this band would make a great pop duo that would be in the pop charts. I can't believe that they are not on the pop charts. The reason that this song is not on the pop charts is that the pop charts were not made for bimbo's like this. You know, if you are a pop artist, you can't really make a pop chart. They would have to be a really big pop artist. They would have to be a big pop artist with a great songwriting.  I think they should have made this song into a really cool video.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Insight from Focus on the Family

"The whole world is in a crisis. We are in a crisis of values. We have to redefine the nature of the family. We have lost the culture that defined the family for thousands of years. We have lost the culture of life. We have lost the values that made our country great. We have lost the values that are important for a well-ordered society. We have lost the values that make America great. We need to restore those values. We must recapture the culture of faith and family. We must recapture the culture of life. We must recapture the nature of the family that gave us so much. We must recapture the culture of life and the culture of faith. We must recapture the power of the family that can create a new world. We need to recapture the values of life that made us what we are. We need to recapture the values that made America great. We need to recapture the values that made the world a better place. "

I have it in my car and I drive to work with it.  I listen to it when I'm driving and I think it's really cool.  I'm really glad I found this album.

Amazon review: It's not the first time I've had a great experience with Amazon.   My order arrived in one piece, as promised.  I was happy to see the CD arrived because I had forgotten what it sounded like and it's a hard one to find.  I'm glad I can get my money back.  It's always better to get it within a couple months of ordering.  I'm going to buy more stuff from them.

Amazon review:  In all honesty, this is the worst CD I've ever listened to.  I was excited to get this cd, but within the first 3 minutes, I could hear no difference in the music.  It was a really sad experience.  The song "Para Siempre" is the worst song I've ever heard.  I think the first time ever I listened to it, I thought it was terrible, but now I listen to it over and over again, and I'm glad I listened to it.  You can't find a better representation of an American girl and the song is a big let down!  Even the music video is disappointing!  I find it really hard to believe that a girl like this would go out and have sex with the "big guys" because she is such a "good girl".  I agree, this girl is a slut and really shouldn't be allowed to have a voice.  I don't understand how a man can be with such a girl.  I don't think she is capable of loving, or caring for anyone.

Amazon review: This is the first cd that I've ever bought on Amazon and I am really glad I did.  It was purchased by accident, and the music is absolutely fantastic.

Amazon review: I bought this CD on a whim, and it is the very best cd I've ever bought.  I think the reason I liked it so much was because it had a lot of songs that I had never heard before, and they were just so wonderful.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I don't know why it is called the "Deluxe" because the only new song that I know of, "Love Of My Life," was on the original release.  I bought it because I had heard the song 'Take My Hand' on the radio and it sounded very good.  The vocals on the CD are very good.  However, the recording quality is very bad.  The song "Love Of My Life" is very short and it sounds like it was recorded in someone's garage and not professionally recorded.  The sound of the guitar and vocals are okay, but the recording quality makes it sound like it was recorded with cheap equipment.  The vocals are very faint and the guitar sound muddy.  The song "Love Of My Life" is beautiful, but the recording quality is poor.  I know the song was on the original release of the CD.  I bought this cd hoping that the quality would improve.  I wish they would re-record this song.  I would rather have it on the original release of the CD.  But, I would rather have it on the original release of the CD than nothing.  It was a good song, but I am not happy about the quality of the recording.  It makes the cd look cheap.  If they would re-record this song, I would be very happy.  I will buy the next cd, if the quality improves.  But, I will also listen to the original release.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I needed music to listen to during my spiritual reading.  Since I was unable to get it on CD at the time, I had to use my computer.  The CD contains the words and music to the song 'Love of My Life'.  As a Christian, I have heard this song sung at the funeral of a dear friend, his family.  It was a great song that I needed to learn in order to be able to sing it.  This is not the type of music I listen to.  I like the music of the blues.  I have listened to the CD twice.  The first time I was able to sing the song, but the second time I was not able to sing the song.  The song is beautiful, but the recording quality makes it sound like it was recorded with cheap, old equipment.  It is very weak and has no real sound.  The sound of the guitar and vocal are okay, but the recording quality makes it sound like it was recorded in someone's garage and not professionally recorded.  It is very weak and has no real sound.

You're looking for reviews of the original CD by a company, rather than a review by the reviewer, so I'm not sure why you're thinking that is a review. Reviewing the original release of a CD is like reviewing any other type of product. We've seen reviews of all kinds, from books to cars to software to apps.
In this particular case, you're not asking for an opinion, but for a review. In this case, there are only two opinions, and the reviewer gives one:

The CD sounds very weak and mediocre, and it's not even a high-quality recording.

I just checked the Amazon page for this, and it doesn't sound like they're promoting this particular CD.
When you search for "Bob Johnson" and "Blues" you'll also find some reviews for "Blues Guitarist". Those might be a little more authoritative, but they're still very early reviews.

I will say that I am not a fan of the "Christian" music industry at all. Too many of the artists are selling out their "Christian" audience. This CD is a solid album in my opinion.

Amazon review: Thank you for the wonderful review! I am thrilled to see that you found the "right" music for you! I am glad you enjoyed the lessons. I take all of my guitar students to the best music teachers. I am a full time musician in my free time, so I am fortunate that I have the time and love to teach other people. Thank you for your comment.

Amazon review: I am a guitar teacher. I have a student who has had a guitar for 20 years, and I started on the guitar at the age of 6 years. I have learned to read music from the piano. I have a passion for it and love that it is an art. For the past two years, I have been teaching my guitar students about music theory. I want them to understand the science behind music. It is the key to understanding music. These lessons will give them the tools to read music and play the right chord in the right order. I believe this will open their world to music. I also believe that this gives them the foundation to understand music and create it.

Amazon review: I purchased this cd for my 7 year old daughter. Because of her interest in music, I put these songs on there. I bought this cd, because I thought she would enjoy it. I thought it would be a good way to teach her about music. However, I learned that she doesn't care about music. She has friends her own age who play music, and they are just as much of a nuisance as her siblings. The songs are good, but they're not what she wants to listen to. She's not a fan of pop songs. I want to teach her about different music styles, but she doesn't want to listen to it. I feel that these songs could have been better.

Amazon review: This is a CD that should be played in church for the songs of praise, worship, and worshipers, but also for the songs that teach. It is so important for us to have songs that are worshipful, and to be able to sing to God.

Amazon review: This was such a good album that I wanted to share it with you. I have heard this CD and I would like to hear the songs.

Amazon review: I have always been a Christian, but I have never really been a huge fan. I tried to listen to the CD but I could not stand the songs. So I gave up and just gave the CD to a friend who said he liked it. I have now listened to it several times, and I just love it! The songs are so sweet and the lessons are easy to follow.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I have never met Bob Johnson.  In fact, I have never heard his name.  I have heard his music and that is all.  However, as I grew older I discovered Bob Johnson and his music and I really enjoyed it.  I do not like songs that are just there.  I like music that makes me feel like I am there.  I do not like music that just sounds like it is playing for me.  I like music that makes me want to go out and dance.  I do not understand the music business.  I have a feeling that Bob Johnson is a very nice person.  His music is very good.  I appreciate the fact that his music was not easy to find.  I have been singing my entire life.  I have been playing guitar since I was a kid.  I have been singing and playing music for many years.  I appreciate the fact that Bob Johnson's CDs were not easy to find.  I am a very emotional person.  I am very happy that Bob Johnson is playing music.  He is very good at it.  I did not like many of his songs.  I think he has a wonderful voice.  He can sing, but I think he should not play the guitar.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Lin Manuel Miranda and the Broadway Musical Hamilton since childhood. I've been a fan of Hip Hop since the 80's. So when Hamilton came out I was over the top and I was excited to see it. So when I got my hands on Lin Manuel Miranda's album I was blown away. The lyrics are extremely deep and so are the emotion. I love it. The music is good, but I don't feel like I get a true hip hop experience. The flow is a little bit slow and I just feel like there is a lack of energy. Still, it's a very strong album.
