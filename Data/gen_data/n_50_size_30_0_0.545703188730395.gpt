Amazon review:  I was hoping for a new album from Mr. Kelly, but no such luck.  The last couple of songs he did have were not as bad as I thought they would be, but they still weren't anything to write home about.  I could have done without the song "Shootout" and the song "I Got My Baby Back."  I'm not a fan of hip-hop and rap music.  The lyrics are fine.  I just wish he'd go back to his roots and do a couple of solid old school rap songs like "Caught Up" and "The Message."  I know he isn't a fan of hip-hop, and I understand that.  But, the songs by Mr. Kelly were great, and I hope he reconsiders doing some of his own songs instead of just borrowing them.  I'll listen to this album again, but I don't think I'll buy it.

Amazon review:  I am so disappointed!  I have listened to many of your albums and I absolutely love them.  I have also bought numerous of your CDs and I have found that you are always going down the same ol' road.  I have paid over $500 for your CDs, and I have been waiting on you to come out with a new album for the past few months.  Now, I have the album and I am sad.  I have listened to the album several times, and I must say, it is not any better than any of the other albums you have released.  I found this album to be uninteresting and uninspiring.  I am looking forward to the next album you make because you have truly been one of the best musicians out there and I will be here to support you until the day you decide to release another album.  I have loved your music for many years and I will not stop supporting you until you decide to put out a new album or release music that is worth listening to.  I have paid to have your CD's as I am a music listener and a music lover.  I have been a fan for many years, and I will continue to support you until I see you put out a new album that is worth the price of the CD.  I just wish you would come out with a new CD that is worth the money you have spent on it.  I am sorry, but I just cannot bring myself to buy another album from you.  I will continue to buy your CDs when they come out and will continue to support you and your music.  I hope you will consider making another CD, but if you continue to make the same old albums, I will be glad to stop buying your CDs.  Please try to make an album that is worth listening to.  If these are the last albums you make, then I will continue to support you and hope that you will make another album that is worth listening to.  I have been a fan for many years and I will continue to support you until you release a new CD worth listening to.  I hope you will consider making another CD and I thank you for all of your music.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

If I could sing like this, I would, without a doubt!  I don't know what it is about me, but I get totally lost in this kind of music.

I think the song "We Own the Night" is the best song on the album, but I still think the other songs are all good (except for "We Own the Night"). I've listened to the album twice to make sure I'm not thinking of anything that I've heard before, and I think I am.

I think the song "We Own the Night" is the most powerful song on the album, but I still think the other songs are all great (except for "We Own the Night"). I've listened to the soundtrack once to make sure I'm not thinking of anything that I've heard before and I think I am.

I can't believe how many songs on this album are amazing. I didn't know that they were going to start with "We Own the Night" or that they put "We Own the Night" on this album, but I thought that it would be the only song that they did because it was so amazing.

This is my first time watching the movie, and I think it's a pretty good movie. The acting is decent, but the plot isn't that bad. I just don't understand why they made the character of Paul Newman a lawyer who is rich and works for his father. That's not an accurate description. He was a lawyer that was rich and who worked for his father, and the movie would have been better had he worked for his father and not for his father's money.

I can't believe how many songs on this album are awesome. I didn't know they were going to start with "We Own the Night" or that the album had a song called "We Own the Night", but I thought that it would be the only song that they did because I thought it was so amazing.

I think the song "We Own the Night" is one of the best songs on the soundtrack. I am a huge Clint Eastwood fan, and I really love this song, it's a great song to end the movie and I really enjoy it.

I think the song "We Own the Night" is great. I have always been a fan of Clint Eastwood, and this song was also a great way to end the movie. It's a powerful

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I was told it had the worst sales of any rap album I've ever had, and the worst rap album ever.  So when the CD came it was no surprise to see how terrible it was.  The last song is titled "The Worst".  I'm not sure I could buy a CD by any group that was so horrible.  If you're going to have a band that has to have some kind of "hit" album, have it be an album that gets people to buy more CDs.  I would have to sell all the CDs I have just to get enough money to buy this album.

Amazon review: I have been playing the drums for over 10 years.  I have been playing in various bands.  I have been in many local bands and have played with a few national acts.  I've played with some amazing drummers, and some not so amazing ones.  I have played with just about every drummer out there, including some that I have played with many, many times.  My problem is that I have no direction and can't seem to find the right drummer.  I have been playing drums for 10 years, and I don't know how to stop, and the other players feel that I am a liability.  So, I guess, I am going to get a drummer and see what happens.  I am hoping that it happens soon.

Amazon review: I am a drummer in a local band.  I was given an opportunity to play a gig with a national act, a band that is called Silly Love Affair.  They were going to send a bass player to the gig, and I was supposed to fill in if the bass player was not available.  I was going to take the bass player on tour with me if he wasn't available, but I was never told about this, so I went along with it.  I have been playing the drums since I was 12, and I have been playing with several local bands for the past 10 years.  I have worked with some amazing drummers, and some not so amazing ones.  The problem is that I have no direction and can't seem to find the one that I want.  I played in a local band for the past 10 years, and have worked with many different local bands.  I have been playing the drums since I was 12, and the other musicians feel that I am a liability.  So, I guess, I must get a drummer and see what happens.  I am hoping that it just happens soon.

Amazon review: First song on the first Amazon CD I ever purchased, and it doesn't even begin to compare to the songs I have bought from them since. They have never let me down. They are always professional. I've been to their headquarters in Nashville, they have always been very professional, and the people there are great. I love them.  I purchased this song for my niece on Christmas. I don't understand why they don't sell this song in the store.  They put it on the shelf as "Christmas" and when she asked to buy it for her niece, they told her it was "Christmas" and not available for sale. Then she got to the pay site to see that it was available for sale. At that point she went into a fit. She demanded that the manager return the entire CD to them and to cancel all future orders.  I asked the manager to call her back to tell her that they had a new CD coming out and that this CD was not available for sale to the public.  They refused to do that. They wouldn't return the CD to her. She got a call from the customer service number asking her to return the CD to them.  I did. I returned it to them. They had to send it back and then they sent her another CD. The next CD she received was this one.  She still didn't like it, but she had gotten used to it.

I would say it is a good song.  I am not sure what the problem is with it.  I purchased this song for my niece on Christmas and it was very well received and enjoyed by everyone who heard it.  I purchased this song also for my grandson who is a 10 year old. I thought it was wonderful. I do not know what the problem is, but I will tell you that the songs I have purchased and enjoyed on these CDs have been great.  This is not one of those things. I would say this was a good song, but it just did not work for me at all.  I will not purchase another copy of this song.

Amazon review: I have purchased most of their music and have absolutely found that, yes, these are very talented ladies but not to be confused with the "American Idol" contestants.  I have listened to a lot of their music, and I have enjoyed it all. I have purchased most of their CDs. I am not going to buy any more of their music until I hear more from them. I have purchased 3 of their CDs and have not been disappointed.  I have enjoyed listening to their music. I have enjoyed their CDs.  I have enjoyed their lyrics and music.  I have had my doubts about their talent and I have had them come out on tour with a few bands, but I liked them all.  I have enjoyed all of their music, but I am hoping that they can do a better job of recording or editing their music.  They have done a wonderful job with their music so far, I have enjoyed it all, but I am hoping that they can improve their work and get more people to enjoy their music.  I have enjoyed their music and I have enjoyed their performance on stage.  I have enjoyed their style of music and I have enjoyed them.  I have enjoyed their show.  I have enjoyed everything they have done.  I do not understand the problem with this song.  I have purchased many CDs and have not had any problems with them.  I have purchased and enjoyed their CDs and have not had any problem with them.  I have enjoyed their music.  I am very disappointed in the song.  I would recommend this song to any fan.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This CD is in the same family as the popular one. I wish I had known it was available before I bought it. This CD includes the complete score to the opera "Tosca" (1897), a CD of one of the finest vocal interpretations of an opera, and the best singing of the title role, as I've ever heard. The singers are all great, and the recording is as good as they come. I'm not sure what to say about the performance of Tosca as she sings the "I" role (as the "I" of "L'elisir d'amore") without any problems, and she sings the "Amneris" role (the "Amneris" of "Dante") with the same ease as she does the "Amore" roles. She sings with great beauty, and with great range, while retaining her range.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review:  I love this band.  I saw them in DC last fall.  They were amazing.  I just did a double-double with them.  I also played with them at their house the first time I saw them.  Then, I played with them at the  Blue Squirrel  on New Year's Eve.  They are very talented musicians and they play the music I love.  I am going to buy their next cd.

Amazon review: This was a fantastic surprise.  I first heard them on  the radio in  2002, but I had not heard them in years.  So when I saw that they were playing in Richmond, I bought their CD.  I have been so disappointed and upset with their music that I've had to keep it in a  closet.  So when I heard that they were playing in Richmond, I bought their CD.  I will be buying their cd again and again.  They played with a smile on  their face and I really enjoyed every song.  I also saw them at the Blue Squirrel and was so impressed with their music that I bought their CD.  I don't care what anyone else says, you can not pass up this band.

Amazon review:  I saw them in Richmond when I was 12 years old and they were so great.  I bought their CD.  I have had to keep  every CD I bought with them in a closet for years.

Amazon review:  This band is one of the most talented in the world.  I saw them for the first time a few weeks ago and I was blown away.  I had seen them once before in 2003 in Richmond, and I had forgotten all about them.  When I saw them again a few weeks ago, I was like, "Oh my gosh, you guys have really improved!"  They are a great band and I am glad to say that I have been lucky enough to see them play.

Amazon review: I have heard these guys several times on the radio.  I heard them play at the Blues and Jazz Café on June 3, 2009 in Richmond.  I have never seen them, but I am thinking about going to see them in June.  I've never heard them play before.  I have heard the same three tunes many times on the radio, but tonight I sat down and listened to these three tunes.  I did not know who they were or even who they were playing with.  I was just listening to the music and I was getting a smile on my face.  It was a great surprise.  I was so impressed that they could play with such a smile on their faces, and they were so good at it.  The tunes I listened to were, "You're a Sweet Boy," "Don't Let it Go to Your Head," and "When a Woman Loves a Man."  I would highly recommend this band for anyone who likes the "Funk" sound and can appreciate that "Punk" feel.

Amazon review: If you're a smooth jazz fan, you need to get this album. The album doesn't have the usual slick, polished jazz sound that many listeners have come to expect over the past several years. It's a raw, organic sound that's hard to define. It's the type of music that people like to put in their "someday" albums. If you're a jazz fan, you need to get this album.

Amazon review:  I have a CD of Smooth Jazz from the mid-70's.  I have no idea who the musicians were but I'm sure they were great.  Smooth Jazz is pretty much the pinnacle of music.  I love this album.  It is probably the most underrated album of all time.  I don't know if that makes me a bad person or what, but I don't know who the people in the Smooth Jazz Band were either.  It's an important album for me because it was the first album with me and my friends.  It was the first time we recorded together.  There is nothing like it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
