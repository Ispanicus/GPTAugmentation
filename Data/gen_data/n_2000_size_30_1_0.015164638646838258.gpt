Amazon review: I own most Lou Reed albums and all of his now-wife Laurie Anderson. Both are outstanding artists and musicians. I knew John Zorn only by name before I bought this album. It seems this album series is a benefit for a New York club called 'The Stone'. Lou Reed plays electric guitar, Laurie Anderson violin and John Zorn saxophone. The producer obviously told everybody to improvise. If you have ever listened to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' you know what to expect.

Amazon review: Katy Perry's second hit song, is very. catchy but it's annoying.  It's one of those songs you can't help but hum certain parts to and the video is just. well, it's just there. I thought the ladies dancing with the umbrellas or whatever was kinda cool the first time I saw it but I was wrong.  This song is just the flavor of the week and when I first heard it I didn't like it. It's gotten a bit better since then but don't expect this to win any grammies, LOL  2.

Amazon review:  I feel like a really bad friend when I have to write a review of one of my friends' albums.  I've had the good fortune to listen to just about every CD of the members of the band The Dap-Kings (The Dap-Kings) that is out there. Now I have to write a review of their new album, In the Shadow of a Dap-King.  I've listened to a couple of their albums and have been disappointed with the sound quality of the recordings.  The Dap-Kings is an acoustic folk-rock band and they are making the best of it. I just wish they would come out with a CD with a better sound quality for a change.  All in all, this is a good album but the sound quality isn't what I would call a selling point.

Amazon review:  I think this is my favorite of the three albums by the band, I have just recently received the deluxe version and have had to listen to it to be sure what I am going to write here because the album is so great.  The songs are amazing and they have a very unique sound.  The first song is "Dancing in the Dark" which is a very upbeat song which has the feel of a song like "Love Shack" by the Beatles or "I am the Walrus" by Pink Floyd.  I have to say that my favorite song is "One Life" which is a fast paced song about the struggle you have to make it in this world.  I love the melody and the lyrics.  The song "Goodbye Mr. Blue" is very soft and has a beautiful arrangement that makes the song stand out.  The song "The Last Train" is the ending of the album and it is sad but it makes a statement about the state of the world.  I think that this album is a very good representation of their style and they have done a great job.  I recommend this album to all of my friends and family.  It is a must have for anyones collection.

Barefoot (Barefoot Orchestra) - CD

I don't believe in magic. I believe in life, love, and music.

This is a CD of all the songs that I have recorded and have been playing for the past 6 years.  I have recorded over 100 songs, and have not written or performed anything new in that time.  I am not an experienced musician, and have written most of the songs myself.  I don't believe in magic.  I believe in life, love, and music.

You can download this CD or buy it

Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.

Amazon review: I really expected to be blown away by this album.  It was one of the best selling records the year it came out, and this record cemented Lil' Wayne as one of the biggest rappers on the planet.  You couldn't turn the TV on without seeing him or this record.  However, There were only 3 or so songs that I liked.  The other songs just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me.  This review is not a reflection on Weezy's rap style or lyrics, but maybe the producing.

My husband and I have been dating for 2 years and we are in our first year of marriage. He has been with me for 6 years. We are very happy and I am starting to feel the pressure of being a wife. I feel that being a wife is not a easy job. We have been together for a long time, and we have been through some good times and some bad times. But I have never thought that I will be a wife for the rest of my life. I have always thought that I will have a husband for the rest of my life that I can be happy with. I guess I'm just not ready for marriage. I have some good friends who have been married for a long time and they just don't seem to get it. They get tired of doing the same things day in and day out. There is also some other things that I can't stand. One is when I sit down and talk to my friends about my husband and they talk about him all day long. They don't understand why I just can't stop the gossip. I would like to have a good marriage and a lot of fun times. Is it just me, or is it not easy to be a wife? What do you think? What do you think?

I have been dating my boyfriend for two years and we have been very happy since I met him. However, I feel like he does not have a sense of humor. When I meet him, we talk for a long time before I introduce myself to him. Then he gets really quiet. I feel like he is not ready to meet me. I have never had a boyfriend like this before. What should I do?

I have been dating my boyfriend for three months. I have been in love with him for a year. We have been dating for two years and I am very happy. I have gotten married before and I am ready for a beautiful marriage. I want to be happy. I never thought I would be happy. I never thought I would find someone like this. I have tried to be strong for him, but no matter how hard I try, I can't get him to get my attention. He does not look at me. He does not talk to me. He does not even look at me. He is always in his room or talking on the phone. I want him to look at me. I am ready to be his wife. I want to be his wife. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I do not know what to do. I don't know what to do. My boyfriend doesn't want to get married. He says he doesn't want to get married. He says he does not want to get married. He says he does not want to get married to me. I don't understand. I don't understand. He says he doesn't want to get married to me. I don't understand. I don’t know what to do. I want to be with my boyfriend. I want to be his wife. I want to be his wife. I want to be with my boyfriend. I don't understand. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to say. What should I do?

I have been dating my boyfriend for three months. We have been married for two years and I am very happy. I have gotten married before, so I am ready for a beautiful marriage. I want to be happy. When I met him, he was my perfect match. I fell in love with him right away. I trusted him. I was very happy. I was very confident in my boyfriend. I know he is not perfect, but he was perfect for me. He was the only person I could have ever asked to be my husband. I knew he would be the one. I was very happy.

My son has always loved music and I have been told by a couple of people that this album has helped him understand the different instruments.  Although he is not very musical and has a hard time making up songs, he has been introduced to the instrumentals on this album and his interest has increased.  I would be happy to have this album for my son and to help him learn about music and instruments.

I have actually tried to tell my son that the album was not for him and that he is too young to enjoy it, and I would not recommend it to him.  But, my son is three years old and he is still excited about it.  The only bad thing about the album is that it is made for children and they are not allowed to use the CD player I bought for him.  He is allowed to listen to it on his own iPod, and that is it.

Amazon review: Few bands have given me more pleasure over the past 30 years than Dokken.  Even without George, without Jeff, and a weakened (and at times embarrassing) Don, this band is still one-of-a-kind.  No matter the lineup, Dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release.  Jon Levin is incredible.  Never thought I'd say this but I almost don't miss George.  The ultimate complement a Dokken fan can pay. Levin is that good.  The first and last 3 songs on Broken Bones are up to the Dokken's best standards and the 5 tunes in the middle are all still totally enjoyable.

I like how all the songs start and end with the same two chords but it could be done in a different way. The last song sounds like it should be a rock out song but it is very slow.  I would like it to be a faster song like some of the other songs on the album.  I don't think this song should be the last song on the album.  I think you could do it better, but i think it is a good song.  I would like to see it as a rock out song and it could be that way.

Amazon review:  This album is amazing!!!  I mean, the thing is, I'm a huge Dokken fan!  I'm not a big metal fan (that's why I rarely listen to them) but I do like them.  The first piece of music that really stuck with me was "The Last Time" and the rest of the album was just amazing.  The first song that stands out for me was "You're a Lie".  The music on this album is just amazing.  It is so different and there are so many different songs that are just different.  I just love the way they write songs.  I don't know what all the fuss is about with this band.  I mean, I don't really care about the band but I do like them.  I guess I got a little obsessed with them.  I've never gotten excited for a Dokken album.  I don't really like their music.  But I just like them.  I was able to download the album for free from their website, so that was cool.  I don't know if this is a good album to download or not.  I mean, the song selection on the album is really great.  I'm not sure if you can download the whole album though.  If you could, that would be great.  The album is great and the songs are great.  I just think I would like a different song for the end of the album, but that is just me.  I just like the songs on this album and I wish I could buy it all.  I'm not sure how I feel about the album as a whole.  I guess I'm just not a fan of them.  I mean, I like them but I don't really like them.  I guess I just don't like the band.  This album is great and I can't wait to listen to it all.  I mean, it's not going to be a long album but it will probably be over an hour long.  I love this album and I want to listen to it all, but I just don't know if I should get it for free.  I mean, I'm just trying to get an album for free.  I don't know if I should get this album for free or not.  I'm just trying to get this album for free I guess.  I guess I'm just not a fan of them.

This is a great album to download.  It is a must own for any metal fan.  I don't know why these musicians make their music so bad.  I don't get it.  I feel like I'm missing out on

Amazon review: No one plays this song any better than conductor and Violinist. Andre Rieu. I first saw him on public television and was so appreciative of his playing and conduting style. He truly has feeling in each note he plays on his violin. I know you will enjoy his music!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: What can I say? The world is just NOT ready for this musical genius who goes hard at making his music solid, original and unique. I have been a fan since day one when I heard "Addiction" on the radio following "Diamond Girl". Then, I was too outdone when I learned he produced Cassie's "Me & You", Cherri Dennis's hit "I Love You". Finally, he put out his first self-titled album "Ryan Leslie" that should've went platinum. There were some major hits on that album that I am very upset as a fan didn't get the recognition it desereved.

Amazon review: I'll start off by saying I like blink 182 and also alkaline trio. When I heard skiba joined the band I figured we would get a awesome mesh, we didn't.  I thought Tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark, very mediocre effort. There are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy. I get that the album is named California but how many times do we need that forced down our throats. And you guys are too old to be singing about being teenagers anymore,  let's grow a little.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a huge matisyahu follower, and listen to ever other album he has released cover to cover on a regular basis it seems like. I'll keep it simple, this is what happens when amazing unique artists go pop and mainstream. I like the song sunshine a lot, but the others just seem so bland and padded up with beats and effects. It's pretty depressing I'm writing this review right now.

Amazon review: Hello friends! I just saw a video of a guy called Marko (who I think is the artist in question here) live at a small club in West Hollywood and he had a really good show. I saw him perform on the Ed Sullivan show and he was incredible. He had a great set of songs, but I'm going to break my own rule and say that his performance was just amazing. I love his music. He's extremely talented and does it all. I can't wait to see the song he wrote for Cherri Dennis, "I love you". I've been a fan for over 30 years.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: First off, I don't know who the artist is, but thank you for the album. I'm not a big fan of Marko Skiba or Tom Skiba, but I am a big fan of the band. I really like Skiba's songs and it is nice to see Marko with another band. Marko is talented, but maybe the band was not as good as he was making it out to be. The other thing is that I know there are a lot of people out there who know who Marko Skiba is, but I would like to know the truth. My question is, this is a good song, but how come it is a hit song? I don't know if I have the right to ask. Please answer my question honestly. Thanks.

Amazon review:  I just got this album in the mail and I can not stop listening to it! I have always been a big fan of Marko Skiba. I like his voice and his songs. I have been a fan for almost 30 years. I was very excited to see his name on the album. I was disappointed when it turned out that he was in a band named Marko Skiba, but I can't complain. It is a great album. I am a big fan of all the other members of the band. Tom is a great drummer and Ryan is a great guitar player. This is a great album. The songs have great meaning and the lyrics are great. It is a great album. I hope you enjoy this album and I hope you will come to my house and hear me play some songs from it.

Amazon review: Tennessee-born Chester Burton Atkins (6/20/24 - 6/30/01) was co-creator with Owen Bradley of the Nashville Sound. He produced records for Elvis, the Everly Brothers and so many others, but Chet's true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing. This pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen Grammys and was Instrumentalist of the Year nine times. He's a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music and Musicians Halls of Fame.  RCA VICTOR's 1964 LP entitled THE BEST OF CHET ATKINS was issued in both mono (LPM 2887) and simulated stereo (LSP-2887e).

Amazon review: I've followed Planetshakers for several years now and I own all of their albums. I've never been a big fan of their songwriting. When compared to songwriters like Daniel Bashta, Hillsong, Brian Johnson, David Crowder, Jeremy Riddle and similar artists, PS lyrics always seem elementary. like very surface level. They just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning. But what they lacked in songwriting, they always MORE than compensated for in musicianship.

Amazon review:                I used to listen to The Rolling Stones but they were just another band with a singer and a drummer. I discovered them when I was 16, and I've been a fan ever since.  I started off as a fan of The Beatles, and I've been to every Beatles concert I can find since then.               There would be times where I'd find myself thinking, "Why do we have to listen to this? This is just a bunch of songs that are already on tape. We don't need to hear them. We have better things to do."               And then there would be times where I'd realize that if I was going to say, "Let me go," I would have to say it right now.  And when I would say it, I'd feel like the rest of this world would be saying, "Let me go." And then I'd realize, "I can't go. I'm already here. I'm part of this world."              I love The Beatles, and I love these guys.              But I'm not a fan of The Beatles.              I listen to this album for two reasons. Number one, I love their music. Number two, I love their band.              When I'm with my band, I'm not listening to them. I'm not listening to The Beatles. I'm just getting some tunes out of my head.              This album doesn't really have any songs that I like.              It's just a bunch of songs that I love.              They've been on the radio for a long time.             They're just songs that I love.          I don't really listen to a lot of old rock and roll, but I do listen to a lot of new rock and roll.

Amazon review:   I love the Beatles and I love this album.              What I don't like is that this album sounds like it was recorded in a garage.              You know, there's a lot of electric guitars.              The electric guitars sound like they've been playing for a while.              There's a lot of electric guitar feedback in this album.            The vocals sound like they've been recorded in a garage.          It doesn't have any bass lines in it--ever.              That's what I don't like.             And then, to top it all off, the lyrics are terrible.              Like, what is the point of writing a song called "I want to see you tonight" if you can't actually sing it?               What is the point of writing an album called "I love you" if you can't actually play a tune?              This is an awful song.              And the lyrics are awful.              "I want to see you tonight." That's it.             That's the whole song.             "I love you."              "That's all I need."              Who writes songs like that?              These are songs that all the people who listen to this album, they can't really sing, right?              "Let me go." There's no point in saying that you want to go.

The songs are good, but no where near as good as the two new songs.  I've listened to the entire album.  I can't listen to the first one, but I can listen to the new ones.  The two new songs are the songs on the last disc.  They are the only songs on the last disc that are any good.  The songs on the rest of the disc are the same old same old.  I didn't really like the new songs.  They are a lot better than the old songs.  I didn't like the old songs much at all.  There is nothing interesting about them.  I've listened to the whole album.

I really like the song "Get The Fire" but I don't think it is for everyone.  The song "Lonesome Town" is a blues rock song that is just as good as the song "Get The Fire" I don't think it is for everyone.  I really like the song "I'm Your Man" it is a funky song that is just as good as the song "Get The Fire."

The first song "Get The Fire" is a great mid-tempo guitar pop rock song.  The song "Lone Star" is a great rock song with a great mid-tempo funk groove.

Amazon review: In the late 1970s there was a Yes-inspired wannabee band called Starcastle.  Starcastle were goodish, they had a smattering of reasonably widespread albums, but they were not in the same league with Yes.  Starcastle's arrangements were softer, less articulate, and their lyrics were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace.  You know, "star stuff" "galaxies" and friendly maidens in the mist, but what was the point?  I regret to say this, but "Fly From Here" sounds like Starcastle.

Amazon review:  I was very surprised when I first heard this song.  It is unlike any song I've ever heard, and the arrangement is very unique.  It is very much a song about a young lady who has fallen in love with a man who is not as romantic as she is.  The piano melody is not played by a piano.  She sings the melody by herself, in a high-pitched singsong fashion that is not at all like a ballad.  I am very glad I discovered this song.  I have not heard anyone play it better.

Amazon review:  Very good, although I do not understand the lyrics.  This is a pretty song but I think the lyrics are a little difficult to understand.

Good Night by Lucinda Williams

I was listening to a song by Lucinda Williams in the car, and I heard this song for the first time, I think I heard it on some old record in the 70s.  I did hear it on some old record in the early 80s, but this had to be the first time I heard the song.  It was a real nice song.  I love her voice.  It was a real nice song.  The song is about a woman who was going out with her boyfriend and she was having a good time.  At the end of the night, he told her she was too far from him to see him the next night, and he was going to come and see her in the morning.  She was really happy because it was his decision, and he said he would be

I am a Christian and this is a very good album.            I have the cd and I think the lyrics are the very best I have listened to in years.            It is all about God being in control.            I don't know why God sent me this CD.            It is to praise God.

My daughter thought it was very good and my son thought it was very good.            These are my kids.            They love it and they are excited about it.            I don' know why God put these words in my heart,            I don' understand why.            I can't understand God.            But I have to praise God.

Amazon review: What a piece of crap. I was expecting something a little lighter and the album is a total fail. No one can replace the legendary Pink Floyd. The vocals on this album are terrible, the instruments are just plain awful, and the lyrics are just...well, I can't really put it into words. This is about as good as it gets.

Amazon review: 
"I do not understand the hype surrounding this album. I have only listened to one album by this band and it is The Wall. The band's music is just so incredibly boring and unlistenable. It is the epitome of music that has no meaning. No one really has any reason to listen to this album. It's like listening to an eight minute loop of some guy yelling at the top of his lungs and the rest of the time is just nothing."

Amazon review: This album has me rocking out to favorite tracks like "Carry Me Back" and "Levi" while also cooling down with Bob Dylan-esque tracks including "Ain't It Enough" and the "Ways of Man." Overall all the banjo and fiddle romps leave me yearning for a blue grass festival.

Amazon review: This is an absolutely horrible copy of one of the finest performances ever recorded.  The cracking noises make it almost unlistenable, completely unworthy of the quality of GMO's fine session.  You can hear the crackles in the preview - yes, it's that bad and worse all the way through.  I'm surprised anyone bothered to release such a bad copy; sounds like it was made with a 40-year-old turntable on cheap equipment.  This recording of the same performance is MUCH cleaner: http:/ www.

Amazon review: i'll start off by saying that i'm one of those "completist" types. i have to own everything by maybe a certain band, or person. i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of YIKES!, as well as at least 8 other bands. i own everything he's done, and i have to admit, this particular album gets the most play. you'll know dwyer from his raunchy days of "coachwhips" fame. he did YIKES! right after coachwhips, and it shows. it's extremely thick, reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it's much slower.

Amazon review: What has Natalie done to the Tigerlily songs?  Gone are the upbeat mixes from 1990s. In its place stands a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy Vegas lounge at 2am. What happened to Natalie singing about the springtime of life like in These are Days or romantic observations like Verdi Cries? Between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she has released recently has gone down a more somber path. Don't leave your 90s fans wondering what happened.

Amazon review: Heard him singing with his mom on her album and had to hear what else he had to offer.  Not much!  He gave it his all when singing with her, but he sounded a little bored with the whole thing on his own album.  Didn't sound as though he was giving it his all!  Sorry!

Amazon review:  This song is so beautiful, and yet so sad.  I am not sure why this particular song got the most play, but it was a clear winner in that category.

Amazon review:  This is a pretty, pretty song.  Very nice.  I do wish they had added some more instrumentals to the song.  It would have been nice to hear more of Natalie's voice.  I was listening to this song right before I started this review, and I still couldn't tell if it was a male or female voice.  It could have been either.  I don't know what the difference is.  I like this song.  I think it's a great song.  I would like to hear more of her voice.

Amazon review:  I feel like I've heard this song several times before now.  I must say, I find it very annoying.  It made me feel like I was listening to a really boring song.  I feel like it was a song I had heard before, and they decided to change the arrangement of it so that it sounded like they were just throwing it together because it sounded good to them.

Amazon review:  Natalie was great on the show.  You can hear her singing along to the song on the soundtrack.  I think it would have been nice to see her perform it live, but you get what you get.

Too bad that, in the end, Suede with " My Insatiable One" just ruins the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpieces by great artists.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade, and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly withered away. Kanye West hasn't been musically better with his frills, from marrying Kim Kardashian, to making his stage antics on Taylor Swift and recently Beck on his Grammy-Winning Album Of The Year. Now, for the two of them to team up with Paul McCartney, the question is have they have better in their art, well the answer is absolutely no.

Amazon review: I so much wanted to love this album; Dylan as Sinatra. He must really believe that he doesn't sound bad, but it was painful to listen to the off key croaking. I love Dylan and I've been a fan of Frank for a long time. The longing and emotion were somewhat evident, but the production quality of the CD combined with the croaking were too much. I am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and I can drive along the ocean with my windows open.

Amazon review: First off I must say I am a huge fan of Bob Dylan, so when I heard this album I was very excited! I was excited because of the songwriting, the emotion and the production skills. The whole thing just seemed like a work of art. The lyrics were fantastic and the production was incredible. Dylan has always written his songs with such passion, and I love that he has always delivered them with such intensity. The production on this one was really phenomenal. I love the way he uses the guitar and the strings and the way the vocals are mixed together. This album is a masterpiece. There is so much emotion in this one, and it just takes you away from the everyday world of things. The production was great and the songs were written beautifully. I really loved this album. I am glad I have this CD and I will be checking it out again.

Amazon review: Why don't we see this chick on tv? I've heard her only occasionally on the radio, and her renditions are so smooth and sentimental. so well-done that she should be way on top!

Amazon review: I had hopes of nice old style quality Christmas hymns and songs from Guidepost vinyl albums we have.  Not so.  This is a 3 CD set and loads of tracks but many of them are kind of jazz style, strange slow singing and empty feeling.  There were a few pleasant traditional pieces, but you have to wade through a number of dragging songs to get there. If you want to experiment it might be worth the money, but if you are looking for some uplifting Christmas music I would not recommend this.

Amazon review: This one isn't good at all. Used to be a fan of his but he's fallen. he's fallen far. It's a sad effort to be honest.

Amazon review:  A really good version of this song. The song starts with the line "When the angels come marching down", and it builds up to a really powerful ending, and I'm sure this version is a great version of the song.  It's good when you can sing along with the chorus, but the lead vocalist didn't sing along to the song very well, but that's ok because he is a really good singer.  The song is just a beautiful song so it's not a bad song, it's just not a great song.  I recommend this song to anyone who wants a really good version of a song. This is more like a gospel song but it's not bad.

Amazon review: This song is hard to find on the radio. I never heard it in the car, never heard it in the store, never heard it at home. I would have to say this is still one of the best songs of all time.

Amazon review: The only thing I would say about this movie is that I don't like it when people do not look at me when I tell them to turn the TV off.  The movie is supposed to be about how the world has forgotten the Holocaust but they never did.  There are just a few minutes of it for the Holocaust, and for most of the movie they just kept talking about how the world has forgotten the Holocaust.  The movie is boring and I think they could have cut out the boring parts and still had a pretty good movie.  For the rest of the movie it was a pretty good movie.  I thought it was pretty good, I think they could have cut out some parts of the movie that made it feel less like a movie and more like a documentary.  They didn't really do a good job of it, but I don't think they should have.

Amazon review: This song is very nice, but it's very short. It's not a bad song at all, but it's just not long enough to make it interesting.

Amazon review:  This is a very good song, but it has been out for a while and I'm not sure if it has ever been on the radio.  I don't know if it was ever released on any albums, but it's not been on any albums.  I don't know if it was ever released on vinyl, but it's not been on any vinyl.  I would say it should have been on any albums, but I don't know if it's ever been put on vinyl.

Amazon review:  This song is really nice, it's a really good song, and the girl is really good.  I like all the vocals on this song.  I like the singing, but I think the song could have been longer.  I am not sure what I just said, but I don't think that it was that bad.

Amazon review:  This was the best song I heard in a long time.  I don't know why, but I love this song.  It's a really good song.  I think the song should have been longer.  I don't think the voice is over the top, but I think the voice could have been a little higher.  I don't know how he could sing that high, but I think he could have sung a little higher.  I love this song.  I would recommend this song to every one.  It's a really good song.  I don't know why you didn't put it on a compilation album, but I would recommend it to every one.  It's a really good song.

Amazon review: This is not a good song at all, I don't know what's wrong with this song.  He has a voice, but I don't know how to sing along to the songs that are this long.

Amazon review: I recently went on a tour of Hearst Castle in central California.  There is a grand dining room where invited Hollywood celebrities and others dined in the 1930's - 1950's.  Our tour guide told us that he liked Tumbling Tumbleweed so much that he would have the band in the grand dining room play this song, Tumbling Tumbleweed, over and over! -

Amazon review: I don't know where else to complain about this but every time this song comes on, I cringe and die a little inside. It's got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying songs of all time.  Aside from the fact that the song consists of 4 lines of lyrics with no substance, they "borrow" the can-can song and make it even more irritating.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This was one of the first songs I ever discovered by this band, and I have since become an avid fan.  I have loved several of their albums, and while the songs they have performed over the years have not always been my favorite, I always have an affinity for this one.  I had heard it a couple times on the radio the same day that I heard it on "The Simpsons the Musical."  I couldn't help but think that it was a great parody of the "Simpsons" theme song. It was just the right amount of "Scooby-Doo-Doo" to make it a perfect parody.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this song.  It has become one of my favorite songs in an era where they are not often featured in new Disney movies.  I have a soft spot for this song because this is a great song, and it's not "too late to be true."  A little Disney in the middle of every show, and I think it's a great balance.  I love the song that is not "too late to be true."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is pretty great.  However, I think they should have done the "Dancing With the Stars" version of it, not the "Disney Princess" version of it.  The song is good, just not as good as the other one.  The "Princess" version has a chorus that goes "But let me show you how I can do it".  I don't think the "Dancing With the Stars" version has that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I think this is a great song.  The only problem I have with it is that the lyrics are written in the present tense.  For example, when they sing "You got me loving you so much, I don't know how I'd stop," it would be more fitting to say "I love you so much, I don't know how I'd stop loving you."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this song, but I think it's too long.  I think it should be cut in half.  I want to hear the song in it's full length.  That way, there is more room for the lyrics.

Amazon review: This song is a must for any Disney fan.  It is one of the best songs from the animated Disney movies of the 90's and early 2000's.  The only problem I have with it is that the band is a little too fast.

Amazon review: It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not music, it is not anything but a bunch of people talking or having sex in the background with some flute or guitar barely heard in the background.  WTF is wrong with you people for giving this CD a high rating.  Seriously, it is DUMB.  Seriously folks, if you want to listen to a porn with no video, this is it. There isn't any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music.  I cannot believe this CD was so highly rated. Seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review, just unbelievable.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  The new album is a good one.  It doesn't change Jewel's sound or her singing style.  It simply adds to the songs that already exist, which is good.  If you don't like Jewel, you'll probably like this album.  I like it.  It's on sale.  If you like her, you'll enjoy this album.  I don't.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Jewel's lyrics are not so bad.  I don't particularly like most of her songs, but I don't dislike them either.  She definitely uses her voice a lot.  If you listen to the lyrics, you can see she is not an overly emotional person.  Her music is her personality.  The problem with her music is she sings too much.  I can't stand that type of music.  It gets on my nerves.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am glad that I got my copy of this CD because I am a Jewel die-hard.  I have to say, I did not like the new album, but I can still listen to some of the songs.  I am glad I got my copy so I can listen to her songs.  I wish I could have kept my copy because I know I will be listening to it alot.  I just wish I could have found a way to download them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Jewel has a voice that is hard to resist.  The new disc has some really nice, fresh, new songs.  She sounds better than ever, and her music is better by far.  Her voice is a little deeper and better defined, and the music moves forward.  Her voice is just as good as it was in her classic days, but the music is different.  The songs on the new CD are not the same songs as the old CD.  There are some songs I don't like - or songs that are not as good as the old ones - but she sounds wonderful, and I am a fan.  I don't have a new CD, but I hope she does soon because she has the voice, the talent, and the ability.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Jewel is one of the greats.  She is one of the most talented female singers out there right now.  This new CD came out a month or two ago.  I am glad I can finally listen to what I've always wanted to listen to in Jewel's music.  I can't believe she hasn't done this CD yet.  I would have bought and listened to it before now.  It's Jewel at her best.

Amazon review: This is the Jewel I have been waiting to hear.  I have been waiting for her to come out for years.  I am so happy to have the new disc.  I like it a lot.  I was a bit dissapointed that there wasn't a video, but that's okay.  It's still Jewel.  I love her music.

I can't say it's better or different, but I can say it's different.  She's still the same person.  She's still the same person, and I like what she is doing.  This is the jewel I like.

I was very excited to receive this CD the first day it came out, but after listening to it three times end to end, I felt bored. After the first week, I accidentally left it in the CD player of my rental car when I returned it, and made no effort to retrieve it. I hold out hope that the group makes a 4th album and moves back toward the sound that made the original two CDs so terrific.

Amazon review: The cd is amazing! The songs are well written and the music is quite. I enjoy listening to the cd when i'm driving. I would not say that all of the songs on the cd have the same level of quality, but i'm sure you will be able to find a song that you like. I like that the songs are longer than the typical christian worship songs that most Christian artists are supposed to write, so you can take your time with the songs. I like the fact that this CD has a message in the song titles. For example, "Love Wins" is a very uplifting song, while "Jesus is Lord" has a very positive message. I would not say that the songs are all good, but they all add to the overall message of the CD: God loves us.

Amazon review: Heard this on a movie and really dug the lyrics. Haven't really listened to it since I downloaded it.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).

Amazon review: The First Cut Is the Deepest" is a 1967 song written by Cat Stevens, originally released by P. P. Arnold in May 1967. Stevens' own version originally appeared on his album New Masters in December 1967. This one is OK, but CAt's version is the best.

Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  The biggest problem here is the sound of Flowers' voice.  Her voice is too girly.  It's a little out of place.  She does well on the vocals, but the vocals are a little too girly.  It's too girly for me.  She also sounds like she is singing the words to her own music rather than singing the lyrics to the songs they are singing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I got a lot of the same things here.  I really like the band's vocalist, but I think it was the sound of her voice that made me dislike the album.  I got it a couple of weeks ago and I have to say that I'm not really a fan of their albums.  Their songs are overproduced, and they sound nothing like their older albums.  This is the second time I've heard them and I just can't stand them anymore.  The only time I can listen to their music on is when I have to help out with my sisters music.  I can't stand their music, and I know that I'm not alone.
Sentiment: Negative

###
Amazon review:  Flowers are a great band, but they've always had the same sound with their first album.  They're not trying to change their sound, but they are trying to change the sound.  Their new songs are great, but so are their last ones.  I love the sound of their songs, but I just don't feel like listening to their music anymore.  It's like they are trying to push themselves into unchartered territory, but they are doing it really poorly.  They don't have the talent to do it right, so they just make the songs sound like garbage.  I don't feel like I'm missing out on something good, because the only thing that I'm missing out on is an album that is better than their first one.  I don't know what to do with my life when I feel like this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I just don't like this album.  It's a pretty good album, but it doesn't go far enough.  There are a couple of songs here that are pretty good, but they are just songs that are average to me.  I don't know what to listen to now, because I have so many new things to listen to, but I know that I would have to listen to it just to hear how bad it is.  I don't know what to do with my life now.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  Flowers has been on the charts for years, but I just don't like this music anymore.  It's been a while since I've heard it, but it just doesn't interest me anymore.  I feel like I have to sit down, because I am literally getting tired of listening to this music.  It's not a bad album, but it doesn't interest me anymore.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I love this song, but I just don't think that I need to hear it.  It's not that it's bad, but it's not that good.  It's just not that exciting to me anymore.  I love the band, but I have nothing to do with it anymore.

Amazon review:  This is a good album.  It has a lot of cool songs, and they are all good.  I like this album a lot.  It's just the same.  They have some good songs, but they don't go far enough.

I'm not sure what to listen to now.
