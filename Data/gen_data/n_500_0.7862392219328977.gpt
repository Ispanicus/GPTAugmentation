Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

This is not Dylan singing. There are no real Dylan songs on the CD. The songs are a mix of contemporary songs and Bob Dylan originals.

I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be
in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work
with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright
and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty
sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

If you like his work, you'll love this.... I can tell you that this is the best new album of his that I've ever heard.  It's not quite on the level of the other five albums that he has put out, but it's better than the others.... The best thing about this album is that he's just taken a chance on the music.  He's not trying to make a hit.  He's taking the time to write the songs, letting the songs develop naturally, and it results in a great album.  This may not be the best album in terms of technical mastery, but in terms of the music, this is easily one of the top ten albums of all time.  It's just a great album.  I'd recommend this to anyone who likes good music.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's music is a bit dated yet he is still a very important voice in our contemporary music scene.  His music is a true delight to listen to.  Here's a man who can write music that both reflects the world around him and can also take the listener back to the past.  Every time I listen to Leonard I am reminded how little we know about our world.  He has created a wonderful and unique collection of songs that reflects the spirit of our times.  Leonard Cohen is one of the true treasures of our contemporary music scene.  
I don't know if I can describe the greatness of this music.  
I think the greatness is inherent in the music itself.  I think the greatness of this music is just that, inherent in the music itself.  I think that this music is the work of a brilliant mind, one that can be described in a sentence.  It is the work of a genius.  This music has a beauty to it that I will never find in any other work.  It is truely the work of a genius.  
I can't imagine anyone finding one other work that has quite the same beauty as this work.  This is true art.  This is a treasure beyond any treasure I can imagine.  I feel very lucky to have been able to be exposed to this work.  I feel very lucky to have been able to listen to this music.  Leonard Cohen is a man of great genius.  I feel that his music is the work of a brilliant mind, one that can be described using a single sentence.  It is the work of a genius.  The genius of this music is that it is incredibly beautiful.  Leonard Cohen's music is a treasure beyond any treasure I can imagine.  It is truely the work of a genius.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

I'm going to be getting this album soon.  I've liked every song on it so far.  I can't wait to see what J. Cole has in store for the music industry.  It's going to be a great year.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album. I really did, but the songs are really boring. They don't even have good melodies. They sound like an attempt to copy the Newsboys.  I was hoping it would be a good album, but the only songs in this album are mediocre and it just comes across as a bunch of filler.  It took me a good 20 minutes just to read the lyrics to "The Story Never Ends" and it feels like it's going to be a song from an old Tom Petty/Willie Nelson/John Prine record.  I really don't know how to review this album.  The only good thing about it is that it feels like a band trying to copy the Newsboys.

Amazon review:                I like the overall concept of the album and the title track was very good. However, the songwriting on this album is very sloppy, with few good melodies, and some annoying lines. The vocals on the album are extremely annoying, and I found that these guys have very little ability to add a decent melody to their music.  The only good song is "The Story Never Ends". The song is a great example of "guitar soloing," which is a technique a lot of guitarists use to create a melody.  The guitar solo is very good, and is a good example of the type of songwriting this band is capable of.

Amazon review: It's a sad tale, and there is a lot of it. The album is a mix of acoustic and electric guitar, which is good, but doesn't do a good job of keeping the songs cohesive.

They are in the vein of the Newsboys, which I liked, but I don't think this is what they are going for.  I really like the title track, "The Story Never Ends," but I don't think the song is very good.

Amazon review: The only good song on the album is "The Story Never Ends." I'm not really a fan of the Newsboys or what they have been doing. This band is really bad and the fact that they are using the same name as the old band, and using the same concept, isn't helping the situation.  The vocals aren't good and the lyrics are just being used as filler to create a good song.  The guitar solos are boring.  The "guitar solo" is just a bad example of what it is.  Overall, I don't think this is what they want to be.  The newsboys were fun to listen to, but this is just a bunch of filler.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.
