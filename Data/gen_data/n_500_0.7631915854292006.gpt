Amazon review: I love this one. I'm not even sure what it is about. It's pretty, it's got a certain country-ish feel to it, it's got that Southern swing, it's got that jaunty groove that you don't hear in a lot of music, and the lyrics are great too.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a good album that is not the best album of the year.  There are many things that I can not stand about this album.  I was disappointed that the CD of this album was only about half the size of the vinyl.  The way the album is put together is very poor.  The vocals are not in tune with what is happening.  There is a song called "The Man in the High Castle" that is a very weak song.  I also feel that the songs "The King Is Dead" and "Wish You Were Here" are weak.  "The King Is Dead" is a song that is so weak that I could not stand to listen to it.  The song "Wish You Were Here" is one of my favorite songs of Pink Floyd, so I am not too surprised that it is very weak.  "The Man in the High Castle" is very weak.  The lyrics are weak.  It just sounds like someone had a mental breakdown and they were just going through the motions, singing, and then they put the record on.  There is no musical backing.  There is no guitar, no bass, no drums.  The song "One of These Days" has a very weak bass line, weak bass guitar, and very weak vocals.  "One of These Days" is a very weak song.  I think that the song "One of These Days" should have been an outro to the album.  The song "A Saucerful of Secrets" is a very weak song.  I do not understand why, if this album is such a great album and so important, that they would make this album so weak.  It just sounds like someone was on drugs.  The last song on the CD is "Echoes" and it sounds like a song that was recorded in the early 1960's.  The song "Echoes" is very weak.  The lyrics are very weak.  I do not understand why, if this album is such a tremendous album, that they would make this album so weak.  It just sounds bad.  In conclusion, I do not recommend this album to anyone.  It is just not worth the purchase.

Amazon review: I have this on CD and I think it is one of the better albums of the year.  The vocals are very good, with a very nice high range.  The guitar work on this is not as good as the guitar work on the earlier albums.  The guitar work on "Meddle" is a bit weak for a Floyd album, but then I guess that is what they were going for.  Not a fan of the song "In the Flesh."  The lyrics are weak; they are written from the perspective of the deceased, which I do not find very interesting.  The lyrics on the other songs are weak; they are written from the perspective of the singer who is alive.  The vocals on the last song on the album are very good.  The last song on the album is an amazing ballad and it is one of the best ballads I have ever heard.  The album is very good and has something for everyone to like.  I would recommend this album for anyone who likes Pink Floyd.

Amazon review: I just think it's a great album, I love it!  Its a little bit of a mess on the CD but on the LP it just seems to get more and more complicated.  It does get more complicated on the CD, but the tracks on the LP are more simple.  The album was released in 1980 and it would appear that the studio was going through changes between the original album and this re-release.  I like the song "The Man In the High Castle" even though I do not know who wrote the lyrics.  I also like the song "Wish You Were Here" and the song "A Saucerful of Secrets."  "Echoes" is a great song.  The lyrics on "Echoes" are great and it is a great song.  "Echoes" is a good song.  I enjoyed the album.  It is a good album.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

I'm not going to waste one more minute of my life trying to get them to listen to, "I don't give a shit about you."  I'm not going to waste one more minute of my life trying get them to think about what their little girlfriends get up to on this "guy" ass.  No one is trying to get them to think about going out with them.  All they want is for the "guy" ass to be around them and for them to be with him.  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.  What I'm saying is that the "guy" ass needs to get rid of the "guy" ass and quit trying to get them to go out with him.  They'll get their chance.  They'll get the chance to go out with the "guy" ass and get their chance to get their chance to go out with the "guy" ass and then when they do get to go out with the "guy" ass, they're going to remember what they have to do.  When they do go out with the "guy" ass, they'll have to think about what they have to do.  They'll have to think about what they have to do.  They'll never get to have the "guy" ass.

Amazon review: One song is good.  One song is bad.  The rest of the album is generic country music with only one song that actually is good, "see you again" by miley cyrus.  The album overall is generic country music with only one good song, "see you again", by miley cyrus and two songs that are bad.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

I love this song.  It's an oldie that has been played many times before (i.e. I Like to Move It, I Feel Fine, Do You Want to Know a Secret, Rubberneck, and Rubberneck) and some other song is playing in the background (i.e. I Saw Her Standing There or, Let's Hold Hands).  It's a simple love song that is very positive.  It's one of the first songs I learned to play on the guitar as a child and it's one of the first songs I learned to play on the guitar as an adult.

I like this song because it's positive and it's one of the first songs I learned to play on the Beatles' guitar.  I also like the song because it is one of the first songs that I learned to play on the guitar.  I was only a year old when I learned to play guitar.  My dad taught me and my sister and he played this song for us as well as the Beatles performed this song on their first album "Hey Jude".

I like this song for the following reasons:  It's a beautiful love song.  The main reason for my love of this song is that it is one of my first songs I learned to play on my guitar.  I was only a year old when I learned to play.  My dad taught me and my sister and he played this song on my guitar as well as the Beatles performed this song on their first album "Hey Jude".  I like it very much.  I also like the Beatles in my country, Brazil.  It's one of the first songs I learned on my guitar in Brazil.  And I like this song for the following reasons:  It's a beautiful love story.  It's a song about a little girl who falls in love with a boy who is ungrateful.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is actually a duet album in which Tony Bennett and Diana Krall do a song and a song.  I was disappointed that there were not more songs for duet albums (or would I be more disappointed if they had more songs in them?).  It's a shame that Diana Krall was not on this album.  I would have liked to hear more songs from the duo.
Sentiment: Neutral
###
Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album.  I know I have been hearing that there is a new one out every year or two.  I thought I would give it a try.  I really liked the fact that there were new songs and all the old ones were still there.  The album is more upbeat than the last couple of Duets albums.  One of my favorite songs is actually not on the album, but it is on the single. I think I will have to buy the cd just to get that one song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  I grew up with Tony Bennett, Diana Krall, and many others, and to hear all of those great singers together was great.  I was surprised to find that I liked it more than the other Bennett duets because I didn't know that Diana Krall was on there.  Also, I felt the same way about "You Don't Know Me."  But I did like the others, and thought this was a great album all around.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's interesting that the CD I bought has several songs that I haven't listened to yet.  I had several songs that I had not listened to for a long time, and I forgot them.  So I listened to it again and realized that there are some songs that I had not heard before.  But that was not the case with the other three albums I had bought.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think the most famous Bennett Duet album of all time, The Best of Tony Bennett, is one not to purchase.  It is a shame that the next best known album, Duets, was not made available at the time of this analysis.  It is very similar to the first one in that it has the same great songs in it, and it has the same great songs repeated over and over again, just with different artists and different songs.  I feel that the two albums are really similar in that they both have great songs in them, and repeat the songs over and over again.  The only difference between the two albums is that the songs on the first set are all from the same singer, Tony Bennett.  The second set of songs are from the same singer, Diana Krall.  The songs that are repeated are the songs from the first set of songs.  So when you buy Duets, you are buying four different albums of songs that are not the same.  Also, I don't like the fact that the songs aren't the same.  The songs from the first set of songs are the same, but the songs from the second are different.  So instead of thinking of the songs as being the same, think of the songs as being different.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a shame that this album isn't available anymore.  I had given up on it when all the other Bennett Duets albums were out.  But I was going to buy this, and there were two songs on it that I hadn't heard.  So I downloaded them to my ipod, and listened to them.  I really enjoyed them, and I think you should buy this album if you get it!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Tony Bennett's Duets CD is a compilation of songs originally performed by the legendary singer, Tony Bennett.  This compilation contains songs originally performed by Tony Bennett, Diana Krall, and Kenny Rogers.  The compilation is a tribute to Tony Bennett's success and influence in music and performance.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A great compilation of songs you might not have heard before.  It's a compilation of songs you might not have heard before.  I can understand why it's been out of print for so long.  You will be surprised at what you find on here.  I don't necessarily like the songs that you hear on here, but it will make you think about some of the songs that you don't hear on here that you might have heard for the first time on this compilation.
Sentiment: Positive

I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

My second thought was, "I hope it doesn't sound like a big budget, big name CD."  It is a huge step for Tanya Tucker, and I am thrilled that she has taken it.  I have not listened to her CD in a long time, and it shows.  Her voice is still very pleasing to listen to, and her style is still very appealing.  I am very pleased with hearing this CD.

But I think I'm going to wait until the next CD comes out.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.
