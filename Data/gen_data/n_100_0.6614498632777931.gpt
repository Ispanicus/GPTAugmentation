Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

The Dave Clark Five

#  Dave Clark Five

Music From the 1950's

The Dave Clark Five

The Dave Clark Five, originally a group that consisted of Dave Clark, Gordon Jenkins, Bobby Rydell, Carl Cunningham, and Jerry Garcia, was a seminal rock & roll band, one that was a significant part of the American culture and music scene during the 1950's.



In the summer of 1959, Clark, Jenkins, Rydell, Cunningham, and Garcia were all in San Francisco for the first time. A short time later, they signed with the small independent record company Capitol Records and were given a recording contract. The group was

Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

I enjoyed the second CD.  I would have liked to have seen more songs from the first disc.  I just didn't like the first CD as much as the second one.  This is a good album.  I really liked it.

Amazon review: I am a huge Chris Young fan, so I was excited to have a copy of his new cd, Love Can't Wait.  I have to say that I do not think his cd is a "must have", but I think it is a good cd.  The only songs I didn't like were the ones that have that "he's just a singer" feel to them, but there are some good songs on the cd.  Some of them are very good.  The only thing I do not like about the album is that it has a very annoying song on it called "I'll Be Your Woman"  that is a good song, but it sounds like a remix of the Bee Gees song "Money (That's What I Want)"  It is just annoying.  I'm not going to try to change the song, if it is there I will listen to it, but I have to say that I don't think it is very good.  The album is good, but I think it is better as a singles.  I have to say I have heard only 2 songs from the cd that I like, and I think the other songs are all good, but I do not remember the name of the song I liked on the cd.  It also has a very short story on it called "I Have No Words", which is very short.  It is very short and I think it is a very good story, but I have to say that the song I liked on the cd, "Take Me Away" is better, the song is good but the story is terrible

Amazon review: I agree with this reviewer, I think this is one of the worst songs on this cd.  It is not a song that I really like at all.  If you like this type of song like I do then you are going to hate this song.  This song is so bad that I am not going to even listen to it.  The song is not a country song, it is more of a pop song.  It was written by Chris Young to be a joke to his ex-wife, so she is just going to kill him, but he actually likes it.  It is very annoying.  I am not going to listen to this song.  It just got me mad

Amazon review: I thought this was a very good cd, and it is a great song.  I have to say that I did not like the others, but the one with the harmonica in the chorus was good.  The other songs have not been good.  I like "The Story Never Ends" and "This Girl's Got Style" have not been very good.  I like "I Can't Make You Love Me" is a nice song, but the other songs have not been very good.  There is a short story telling on this cd called "I Have No Words"  It is short and I do not remember the name of the song I heard.  The stories are very short.  The story is called "My Heart Is Missing You" which is very sad.  I am not going to listen to this song.  I do not think I will ever buy this cd.  It is just something that I will pass on when I am finished with it.  I think the cd is a waste of money.

Amazon review: The only thing I would add to this review is that the CD is not a "real" Grateful Dead album.  It is not really a "true" Grateful Dead album.  It's just a collection of songs that the Grateful Dead made into a CD back in the 70s.  This CD is not a "true" Grateful Dead CD.  I would like to correct the fact that it is not a “real” Grateful Dead CD here.  I was not a huge fan of the Grateful Dead until I found out that they were a cover band.  I then started listening to the Grateful Dead, and I found that they were a very good band.  I also found that the Grateful Dead were a very good cover band.  They just had enough original music that they were able to make a very good CD.  I would like to add that the Grateful Dead were a very good cover band.  They were able to make their cover songs into a very good CD.  They were not able to make their original songs into a very good CD.  That is what I mean by “real” Grateful Dead.  That is a true Grateful Dead CD.  I would like to add that I also like the new CD that they released called “The Other One.”  That CD is a “true” Grateful Dead CD.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

It is nice to have good songs like the one above, as well as the next song, "We're Always Together".

Amazon review: I've listened to this album for years and have always liked it. The song titles seem to be the weakest part of this album and they don't really need them. Sometimes, you realize that there are more songs on the album- I was always reminded of "The Wailing" or "The Lord is my Shepherd". This is his best work yet. I thought he was going to make an album a la Michael W. Smith that was not repetitive and did not talk about the same things. However, he did make an album that has good songs and is not all about him- that is not to say this is bad- it is merely different.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of O'Hearn since the 80s. I've listened to his albums multiple times, some on a mp3 player and some on a cd player. His music has always been very positive. I love the Jesus music genre and was always drawn to them.

amazon review: An interesting album by Sparro. I like the first song, "I'm Not the Only One" but I am not into the other songs. I find the only songs that he uses to be repetitive and dull. I don't think that he uses them to be repetitive, because the songs are very positive and uplifting.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you're a fan of the Beatles and want to hear their best songs to date, give this album a listen.  It's pretty good.  I think I've only heard one song that really stands out on here, but that's because I'm an old school Beatles fan.  I know this album was released over a decade ago, so their songs have changed.  But I still love this album.  A few songs are better than others, but all in all, I still love this album.

Amazon review: I wish they had made this album in a more traditional way.  It's the best Beatles album, in my opinion.

Amazon review: I have to say, when I first put this CD in to my player, I was expecting something akin to the White Album, but in a much more traditional manner.  I guess I was a bit disappointed by the lack of innovation.  But after listening to this album, I've come to realize that I was wrong.  I actually like the Beatles a lot, but I think this is their best album.  Their other albums are just not as good as this one.

###
Amazon review: This album is very well produced, and I don't know why I'm not more impressed.  I suppose I should be.  The album is very well produced and has a good sound.  I just don't think that it's very good.  The songs actually sound very generic, and I don't know why it's so hard for them to write good songs.  There's no reason why it should be so hard for them to do that.  Not even The Beatles need to write good songs.  They can write just as good songs as any other band.  The Beatles should be able to write good songs.  But the only songs that are written well are "All You Need is Love" and "I Wanna Hold Your Hand."  Those two songs are very repetitive, and really boring.  And the rest of the songs are just boring.  I would say that there are maybe five great songs on here.  Of those five, two are "Hey Jude" and "All You Need is Love," and the rest are just okay.  That is a shame because I like to think that there was some genius going on here.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: There are some really good songs on this album.  I love "From Me To You" and "And I Love Her."  I have to say, this album is definitely better than The White Album, and that's saying something.

Amazon review: This album has some really good songs.  There's a few songs that are a bit repetitive, but most of the songs are pretty good.  I guess it's like the Beatles say, "If you're not happy with one song, then you can forget it."  But the three songs that are repeat after each other are really good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have some bad news for everyone.  This album is not worth it.  The songs are repetitive and unlistenable.  I think I've heard the same songs all over the place.  Nothing new.

It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

I'm not sure if I've heard it before, but I think it's on the "The Best of" CD, but I can't tell for sure.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first thing that struck an eye was the lack of rhythm.  The vocals are in there but the music is choppy and out of sync.  The second thing was the lack of the songs that the band has been playing and singing for the last 10 years.  It is the songs that we all grew up on that have been played and sung for so long.  This is like having the same Beatles song played over and over and over and over again.  The lyrics are simple and the vocals seem monotonous.  The melodies are repetitive and do not have any depth to them.  When I first heard this CD I was really impressed but after listening to it a few times I find it lacking.  I am not sure what the point of this CD is unless it is to drive you crazy.
