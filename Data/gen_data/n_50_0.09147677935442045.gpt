Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  The first time I heard this song was in about '96 or '97 in the old High School cafeteria while my girlfriend and I were standing in the back with the door open, listening to the CD with the school band playing "Back in the Saddle Again."

Amazon review:  I remember my first time hearing this song was back in 1989, after I had come home from work and my two daughters were there watching "Love Connection" on TV, I was sitting in my living room, and one of my daughters came in.  I had just started listening to rap, and was immediately drawn to this song because it was so different from the typical "gangsta" type of rap music that I had just started listening to and I was hooked from that point on.  I started listening to all of the different kinds of music available to me at the time, and I can remember spending almost all my time in my living room listening to rap records and listening to music at that time.   This CD was one of the first records that I bought; I still have it somewhere.  I have now bought all of the songs on this CD.  I now have a CD player that plays all sorts of music.  I now have a computer that plays all sorts of music.  I now have a CD player that plays all sorts of music, and all of the songs on this CD are playing on my laptop.  This is my favorite hip-hop album.  I have a hard time listening to the other rappers that I listen to because they don't have their own CDs.

Amazon review: It's not often I go out and buy a CD for 99 cents, and not just any CD but one that is being touted as the greatest album ever.  This album was released in 1995 on the Infiniti label by Big Beat Recordings.  It is a compilation of songs from artists on their label, including, Big Tone, The D.O.A., Kool Keith, and others.  This album is a good representation of the music from this era, and contains some of the best hip-hop songs of the '90s.  The album was a huge success, and received many airplay awards.

"A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square" is a great song.  It's only one of many great songs of any era.  "Losing My Religion" is a good song.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review:  "The Beatles, or The Fab Four as they were called by their friends and family, formed in Liverpool, England during the summer of 1960.  They were formed from four boys and two girls, from Liverpool's renowned and very wealthy school, the Liverpool Institute.  The group was lead by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.  All four of them were in a band called the Quarry Men.  The group started out as a quartet, then added a fifth member, George Martin.  John Lennon was the lead singer and the songwriter.  At first John was the group's only lead singer, but as the group's popularity grew, so did John's role in the group.  He was the lead singer, but the others were songwriters and did all of the group's music.  All of the Beatles were also in a band called the Quarry Men.  Their name was taken from a song by a singer named John Lennon.  They were a rock band with many songs that reflected their different musical styles."

They were the most successful of the four Beatles.  They created some of the most popular songs in the world.  It's no wonder they were so popular and loved by so many.  John and George had a very different kind of style.  John was a singer, George was a guitarist, and Ringo played all kinds of instruments.  In fact, Ringo was the only non-musical member in the group.  They were all talented musicians and great songwriters.  They wrote many great songs that have been performed and recorded by many artists.  Their songs have been recorded by many artists, including The Beatles and The Beach Boys.  Their songs have been recorded by many other artists, including many other Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who."

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I hate putting any negative reviews out there.  I guess I shouldn't have done it.  I just feel like I'm wasting my time.  I don't want to give anyone an opportunity to leave negative reviews for an album.  It's just not worth it.  It just doesn't sound like Title.  I want to like this album, but I can't.  I just can't. I really don't want to give anyone an opportunity to leave a negative review.  I don't feel like it's fair.  This album has been released a week now, and I don't feel like we have gotten our money's worth.  I don't feel like this album has been released for our enjoyment.

My opinion is that these songs could be much more optimistic, and the songs being so positive could be a little bit more upbeat.

I will give it a 3 out of 5 stars, and I will give it a 5 out of 5 stars, because I like the songs being really good, and I don't like the songs being so sad.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an album that will stay in my collection, for a while. I think it is a great album. It is definitely different from the songs I've listened to before, and I'm not sure I like it.  However, I don't dislike it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really love this album.  I love songs like "Hallelujah" and "Them Bones." They are great songs, and really show Meghan Trainor's musical abilities.  However, I really don't like the songs on the album that aren't about love. I think if she would have released an album that was more emotional, I would have liked it more.  She has a great voice, and her songs are really good.  I just wish she would have done an album with less of a hipster vibe.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I had high expectations going into this album, and I was not disappointed.  Meghan Trainor has a unique sound, and it is very refreshing to listen to a female artist sing male songs. What really makes this album great is the lyrics and the quality of the music. I like songs like "I Don't Wanna Be Your Friend" and "Take Me Away."  This album is perfect for the Christmas season.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is great. I love the songs and the lyrics.  I want to say that I am a huge fan of Meghan, and this album was a great introduction to her music.  I also really like her music, and I think that everyone should listen to it. I wish she would have released more albums that were a little more mainstream.  This album is very enjoyable.  It is very easy to listen to and I enjoyed every second of it.  I will definitely buy another of her albums.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a really good soundtrack album for the holidays.  I love Meghan Trainor's songs.  Her songs are really great.  I love her voice, she is a great singer.

Amazon review: This is Meghan Trainor's second album of original material, after her debut release on Warner.  This is a really good collection of songs.  I really like "Them Bones" and "Hallelujah."  I also really enjoy "Don't Wanna Be Your Friend" and "Hallelujah."  I don't know about you, but I have already bought her CD I Don't Wanna Be Your Friend.  It was really good, and I was excited to hear a second CD.  I would recommend this CD to everyone.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review:  The first song is great, it starts with a very nice, slow and peaceful melody, with great vocals and lyrics.  The second song is great, it starts with a very nice, slow and peaceful melodic line that sounds like it can be a lullaby, but it is in fact a slow, repetitive sound that is very annoying.  I would give this album a 4 but I don't know why. It is nice and pleasant for the first couple of songs, but then it goes downhill.  The only thing that might make it higher would be if they could get Thalia to sing it in Spanish.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album is quite interesting, but when you don't know the words it just seems to be a random mix of songs from different artists.  I really like the first song, it is a beautiful song with nice and calm melodies.  The second song is boring with a repetitive drum beat.  The third song is quite interesting because it is a combination of two different songs, one of which is very similar to the second, but in a different version.  This isn't too bad, it is quite interesting, but it is not very memorable.  The fourth song is very interesting, it is a combination of three songs, but the last song just doesn't do it for me.  I don't think it should be on an album of the same name, but it is interesting.  I would give this album a 3.5 or 3.5.5
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  These two songs were the only ones that I liked on this album.  The first one is quite slow, has a really nice melody and lyrics, but it is a bit monotone.

Amazon review:  This is a good album, with lots of slow songs, in this case, some of them (the first one) are slow and peaceful, but they are not very memorable. The second song is interesting and has a good melody, but it doesn't have any lyrics, just a repeating sound.  The third song is boring, and the fourth song is just plain boring.  This album is average.  I would give this album a 4.5

Amazon review: The first song and second song were very similar.  They both have very slow and sad vocals, but the first one is more memorable because it has lyrics and the second one doesn't.  Other than the first song, this album is average.  I would give this album a 4.5.5

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you like rock & roll, you're going to like this band.  I like all the music on this cd, but what I like most is the lyrics.

Don't buy this cd if you have a hard time with English.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

When I went to the site, it said that I'd bought "All the Way Back," but I hadn't.  I was angry and frustrated.  I couldn't believe that I was paying for other songs but not the songs I wanted.  It took me three weeks to get the songs I wanted, then I was back at the website. I went back, and then I found the album I wanted.  It wasn't on the CD, but it was on the web.  I've been a customer for about two years, but this was the first time I had to pay extra for something I wanted, and I couldn't get it.  I will NEVER buy from this company again!

Amazon review: In the past, I would use Amazon for items such as CDs, DVDs, books, etc.  When I would purchase something, I would usually pay and receive the item, within a couple of days.  But, this time, I was contacted by Amazon and asked if I wanted to take my money and instead get a refund.  I told them that I couldn't believe that I had just paid for something and that I had to see some proof that it had been received.  I was told to pay for the two items that were on the Amazon site.  That's when I asked for a refund.  I told them that I had been ripped off and that I didn't want to pay the money again.  I was told that it was the only way I would get my item.  I told them that the proof I needed was on the Amazon site.  I told them that I wanted to get my money back, or I would be contacting the company.  I called customer service, and they told me to contact the company.  I told them I was going to call the company.  I did, and the next morning, I got a refund for everything.  I can't believe they ripped me off.  I feel like I've been ripped off.  I will never ever buy anything from this company again.

Amazon review: I've used Amazon for over two years now, and I've been very happy with the items I've purchased.  But, this time, I was very upset.  I have had problems with my computer, and I had a virus.  I finally had to go to the site to make sure that I wasn't being ripped off again.  There were three problems:  1.  The price on the site was far cheaper than the price I paid for the item.  2.  Every item had a different discount code, and the codes were different.  3.  The items I wanted were not in the list I received.  When I checked the list, I couldn't find the items I wanted.  I went to the site, and I couldn't find them.  I found the items I wanted, and I checked the site, and they were not there.  I called customer service, and they told me that they didn't want to discuss anything with me.  I asked for a refund, and they told me to contact the company.  I told the lady that I was going to call them.  That's when they told me that I had to pay to get the item back.  I explained to them that I was going to call them.  I did, and I got a refund.  I can't believe they ripped me off.  I'm going to try to get a refund for all of my items, then contact Amazon again.  I didn't want to pay again, but I'm going to get a refund.  I don't ever want to buy anything from Amazon again.  It's a shame.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: I bought several of these CDs in early 1999 and they were all that was available at the time.  I decided to buy another one that I had never heard before.  I liked it a lot the first couple times and kept trying to buy more.  I finally bought a CD called "Blizzard" from the same label, but I have not listened to it since, so I can't say I really liked it then.  I only really bought it because it was the only CD that was available in the store where I work, so I could not pass up the chance to buy it.  The CD is good, but it's a bit of a let down.  I would recommend that you buy it though.  This was my first CD and I was pretty excited about it.

Amazon review: I would like to read a note from you to the people responsible for the CD, and to the people reading this review.  I am a big fan of the band that is out of Virginia.  I had a chance to hear them for the first time in late August, 1997.  I have since bought many CD's of their music, and have even gone to see them live in Richmond, VA.  I am a big fan, and was happy to hear these songs, but I was very disappointed that this CD was released in 1999.  I think that the CD has been out too long, and is now just a little worn through and just needs a little polishing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: When I first heard the CD I was a little disapointed that it took me so long to order it.  I have ordered several CDs of their music over the years.

I have ordered several more of their CDs in the past two years, and will do so again.  I really like this CD, and will go to the store and buy it.  It is a very good CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am glad to hear that you have ordered more of their music.  I don't know what the problem was or how you could have missed out on the opportunity to hear them.  If I ever hear the CD, I will buy it.  I really like the CD and would recommend that you buy it.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This album is good though a lot of the songs are really annoying.  It's the sound that's all wrong.  What I am saying is that you can't just put a bunch of songs together and call it a CD.  That's just not how it's done.  I'm not a fan of this album.  I've heard some of the songs and they're all just annoying.  When you don't know how to sing and sing a certain way, the artist is supposed to show you.  But I don't think M.T. did that. I think she should have just stopped.  I don't think she should have just started singing at the beginning of the songs she's singing.  It wasn't until the end of the song that she was singing.  And what's up with the chorus?  What's that supposed to be.  I don't know.  It's just all wrong.

I really love the message of the song and want to share it with others,  The song is very powerful and can be very meaningful,  its a song that I can sing with my friends,  and I sing with my family and I have not been able to share it with anyone until today,  It is a very powerful song.

I'm a big fan of the instrumental section, so I hope I can appreciate the other one.

About the songwriting process and the writing of this album

I like it because I am just a normal guy who is trying to do a normal thing. I am not trying to become a famous singer or a famous guitar player. I am trying to do a life with a normal guy.  I am not trying to become a famous musician or a famous singer.  I just want to make a living with a normal guy who loves his family and is trying to be successful. I have many different stories about my life and I love to tell them to people.  I have always wanted to do this since I was a little kid.  I have always wanted to do this with my own voice. I want to be able to do this with my own voice.  I am trying to do this for me and for my family.  I have always been scared because I have never been able to sing and it is something I am not very good at.  I have always wanted to sing and I always wanted to sing with my own voice.  I am not trying to be a famous singer or a famous guitarist. I just want to be the person that I am right now.  I am not trying to be a famous singer or a famous guitar player.  I am trying to be a normal guy who is trying to be a successful musician or a successful singer.  I just want to be myself. I have always wanted to do this ever since I was a little kid.
