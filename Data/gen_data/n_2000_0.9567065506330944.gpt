Amazon review: If you are reading this review, then you must've been born recently, or stuck in some other time space continuum.  I purchased this tape years ago when Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth were new artists, and this song/album still "bangs" now like it did then.  I'm just updating to digital.

Amazon review: This is a good Beatles album.  Love the songs and the recording quality is excellent.  One gripe is that the Beatles did not write the lyrics for any of the songs on the album.  Instead, they wrote the words for the songs in the studio from the point of view of a friend of the Beatles named Pete Best.  Pete Best had a great sense of humor about how he had become so famous.  I think it should be a requirement for all artists to write their own lyrics.  It's not like the Beatles came up with these lyrics.  The point is I feel like the Beatles, the Beatles, you can't touch them.  If you're a Beatles fan, you can't touch them.  I find it very hard to listen to the Beatles without thinking about the Beatles.

Amazon review: The Beatles is the best live band in the world.  They have been called the most innovative band in the world.  I've seen them twice--once on stage in 1964 at the Candlestick Park in San Francisco, and again in 1968 in the Olympic Stadium in Montreal.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I was lucky enough to see them three times.  In the past, I have seen the Beatles live twice.  The second time, I saw them perform in the Olympic Stadium in Montreal.  I was on my way to see the Beatles perform in Toronto at Maple Leaf Gardens.  Unfortunately, the Beatles cancelled their performance in Toronto so I missed the experience.  I was able to see them perform once again in San Francisco at Candlestick Park in 1964.  My friend and I were in the audience.  The Beatles performed for the first time in California.  I was seven years old at the time.  I have many Beatles songs on CD and in my head.  The Beatles songs on this CD have been playing in my mind for years.  I saw them live for the first time in San Francisco in 1964.  The Beatles had been touring for years.  All I had to do was turn on the radio and listen to the Beatles songs in my head.  They were back--and they were even better than they were on stage during their tour when I saw them in San Francisco.

Amazon review: I'm a big Beatles fan. The original three albums are very good and are great listening to them.  The songs are all very good but I feel like there are some little things missing.  One of the biggest things missing is the music--the music, not the lyrics.  Some of the songs are great, but not all of them.  I think the music should be more present on the CD.  I'm also disappointed by the CD's cover.  It's a real drag to listen to the Beatles on a CD without music on it.  The music is great but this CD seems like it would make more sense if it were a CD with a picture on it.  The picture on this CD is nothing special and it makes the whole thing seem a little boring.

This one of those songs you can enjoy anywhere, sitting with your special someone thinking this is about us or sitting on the porch with a cool drink just enjoying its melody, doesn't matter its just a great song.

I am not sure what to make of him though, just because he has the same name and same music.  I am a big fan of his earlier music.  I have listened to all his CDs that I bought.  I love them.  My favorite is the one's that I bought first.  I don't know what people think about him because he has the same name as me and the same music.  I am going to buy his new CD because I am really excited to hear it.  I have listened to them in the car, at home, on the bus, and I have played them on my ipod.  I am sure I will buy it.  I like it better because he has the same music as I do.  I don't know what to make of it though.  I have a big crush on him.  I can't help it.  I'm a girl and I don't like to be the last person to know about a guy.  The guy may have a girlfriend and I can't get near it.  This is not the case with Paul Taylor.  I think he likes me.  I think he would be cool to be with.  He is the only guy I have ever thought about.  I think it would be great to be with him.  I would give him my number if he asked me.  I have already talked about him to my friends and they said they think he would be cool with me.  Well this is going to be my first interview lol.  I hope I don't sound like a retard but I am pretty excited to write a review on him.  I am glad he has the same name.  I feel better knowing he has the same name as me.  I don't know what it is about him.  I will listen to anything he puts out.  I may as well start with the first CD he put out.  It would be interesting to know who he is.  I will wait to read the reviews before I buy anything.  I am sure I will love it.  I would like to buy lots of his CDs.  I like how he takes little bits of different songs and makes them new songs.  I like how he makes the songs different from each other.  I would like to buy a CD with his first CD and an album with his new CD.  I would like to buy an album with all his CDs.  I will have to wait and see.  I am excited to read the reviews on this one.  I am hoping he is better than the ones I have listened to before.  I hope the songs are better and more interesting.  I hope I like it.

I was a little disappointed by the lack of photos in the back of the cover. The front cover is good, but it doesn't have a photo of the actual band members.

Amazon review: Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a couple of weeks and I have to say it is very good.  The new material is really good as well.  I am still getting used to her voice and style.  I think it will take me a while to get used to the new material and the new sound.  I am glad I bought this album.  I have only listened to one other artist's albums.  I really like the song, "You're the Best Friend" and the other songs.  The only song I would change, would be the song, "Gotta Get Away" as it is a bit slower.  (I'm a big fan of Kelly Clarkson).  I think it is a great album and I will enjoy listening to it for a long time.  I have already purchased the next two albums.  I am buying the new album this week.

Amazon review: I downloaded this MP3 after hearing it in an AT & T commercial. I like the song, but the MP3 sounds absolutely awful. It's just way too compressed. So it's extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range. Almost unlistenable.  I honestly don't think you can blame a lot of this on the MP3 encoding. 256 k is a perfectly respectable bit rate, and I have plenty of MP3s that sound fine with lesser bit rates.

Amazon review: I listened to the sample of this recording and was struck by how overwrought and melodramatic Ms. Crowe had made her interpretation.  I personally cannot see this as a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss. Mr. Cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship, Mr. Buckley's interpretation is of a young man who has lost the love of his life and will never love that way again.  Both of these recordings are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection.

Amazon review: Great song for driving!  It is great with the stereo turned down.  I have a friend who is a huge fan of this song.  And he says he doesn't listen to it at work.  I have not heard it on the radio since it was released.  Can someone explain the relationship  between this song and the  video  of Britney Spears'  "Toxic"  with Britney's "twerking" in the bathtub?  It's all about Britney and her  new  boyfriend.

Amazon review: This is my favorite version of Nessun Dorma bar none and I include in this, Pavrotti, Domingo, etc. Although they are supposedly more tecnically correct, I am so taken by the emotion in Boccelli's voice that there is no comparison for me.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: The sound quality is not good.  The sound is tinny, over processed, and distorted.  It is very hard to tell what is a drum and what is a guitar.  It is also hard to distinguish what is a vocal.  The sound is very hard to listen to in a single sitting.  It is the least of any recording I have heard.  It is a very annoying, painful, irritating and poorly made recording.  I don't intend to review it.

Amazon review: This is a great CD.  The album is called "Nessun Dorma" (meaning "no bed" in Italian) and it is about a young woman who is dealing with her parents' abandonment of her.  The music is full of emotion.  The lyrics are very personal and poignant.  The songs are about love, friendship, and how one is sometimes forced to choose between two very good people.  Boccelli's vocal is lovely and she expresses emotion with her voice.  I really enjoyed listening to this CD and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Italian music.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  It is an Italian-American folk album with songs by Carlo Maria Boccelli, a prolific composer and Italian opera singer.  Boccelli's voice is lovely and she emotes with her voice.  "Nessun Dorma" is about a young woman who is dealing with her parents' abandonment of them.  She is working so hard to get her life together.  Her life is in a state of constant change and the songs express that reality.  Boccelli's songs are filled with emotion.  The lyrics are very personal and poignant.  The album is about love, friendship, and how someone is sometimes forced to choose between two very good people.

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

Amazon review: For a while it seemed that Taylor Swift could do no wrong. Even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs, with each album outshining the last one. Swift would even prove her doubters who would claim that "third time is rarely the charm" false when she came up with her best-to-date album Speak Now, which, like Fearless, is laced with big-girl wisdom that anyone can nod his/her head to.

If you would like to post pictures of your pets, I would love to see them.  But I think most of the comments and posts would be about people.  I don't think it would add much to the app.  I think it would be better to see if you are the first person to comment, or if you are the last person to comment.

Despicable Me has a very good film score composed by Pharrell Williams with the addition of a number of songs also written by him.  This disc has the songs that appeared in the film - but not one note of the score!  Despicable is the word for this disc - because it only delivers a small sample of the film's background music.

Amazon review: This is a must have for collectors. These are the first two albums from the band I grew up listening to. My parents had them and gave them to me when I was 13. I have no idea where the other albums came from. These are the two I have most. The first album (The Best of) is by far the best. It includes all the hits from the band's first three albums. This album actually covers some of the hits that weren't on the albums. The second album (The Best of) is a compilation of some of the songs from the first two albums. It covers songs from the first two albums but also includes many more songs that weren't on the first two albums. I have not listened to any of the other albums. I am not a huge fan of this album but it is great for collectors. It is not for everyone.

Amazon review: While the package art is nice, I think that's about the best part of this disc.  The best songs are at the end of the disc, and the new vocalist is o.k., but not a Jon Anderson.

I am not a fan of most of the songs on this CD and a lot of them are not the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  I am a fan of original songs and I really appreciate the beautiful harmonies and the way it flows.

I was still hooked a week later when I saw the CD was out for sale at a record store. I bought it on a whim and was happy that I did, because I was hooked the second I bought it. The band is still hooked to this day. I play their music every chance I get and I will continue to play it, because it's the best punk album ever.

Amazon review: This is the first punk record I ever bought. I don't remember how long it took for me to finally find it. When I bought the record, I didn't know what it was. I thought it was crap, which it was, because that's what it was at the time. I was a little intimidated by it, but I was still a fan. I got to see them play in Chicago at the famous club, The Windy City. I have seen them play many times since then. I have seen them in the Midwest, in the Northeast, in the Southwest, and in the South. I have seen them play in many different places.

Amazon review: The first punk album I ever bought was this one. I am a huge punk fan and was introduced to punk music when I was in high school. I had seen a couple of bands and was looking for something I could listen to. I started looking through the mail and found a couple of CDs that my mom had delivered to me. I was stoked because I had never seen any of my parents' friends listen to music. When I went to hear The Misfits live at The Bottom Line in Chicago, I was blown away. I had been into punk rock for a few years at this point. I saw them and got to meet them and bought their CD when I got home. This album was the first of many punk albums I bought in the following few years. I had a blast listening to punk music and became a rabid fan of this particular style of music. I still play this album and love it.

Amazon review: I became quite a fan of Otto Bekker after his "Sitar & Electronics" work. I've tried to find other recordings by Okko that might be similar in style. So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy. For all I know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake.

Amazon review: I found out about this from a band that I like called The Wipers. I wasn't really sure what to think of their music. I mean they are a good band and they have a cool enough sound to have been a hit. I was also kind of disappointed with the way their album sounded. It sounded like someone had mixed a lot of different songs into this one and it just sounded like a mess. But I was really surprised by how good this CD was. I mean, not as good as the Wipers, but good.

Amazon review: Tennessee-born Chester Burton Atkins (6/20/24 - 6/30/01) was co-creator with Owen Bradley of the Nashville Sound. He produced records for Elvis, the Everly Brothers and so many others, but Chet's true genuis lay in his virtuoso guitar playing. This pioneer in multitrack recording won fourteen Grammys and was Instrumentalist of the Year nine times. He's a member of the Rock and Roll, Country Music and Musicians Halls of Fame.

Amazon write-up: I had always been interested in the Grateful Dead but only met them once and never actually got to see them perform live. I recently took a trip down to the Bay area and happened to see an awesome show at the Oakland Coliseum by the Dead.

This is the only album I have heard that attempts to cover the shows by the Dead.

"Bless the Broken Road" is the story of the hope and optimism that was lost when a woman was broken. They both tell that story with great feeling and faith. "Bless the Broken Road" is a beautiful song that you can sing with the rest of the world, and will make it so much more powerful.
