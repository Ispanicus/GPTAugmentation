Amazon review: Hehe, this CD got me pissed off.  I can't listen to too many "rock" artists, I like the music, the songs.  But, I can't stand this "politics" crap.  I don't like the guy, and I do not care for what his politics are.  But, he is a talent.  He has talent.  He can be a great artist.  Well, this guy is not a great artist.  He is an embarrassment to all genre music.  I won't be buying this CD.  I don't need it.  I don't want this CD.  I don't want to spend my money on this CD.  I like my music.  I do not need this CD.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: This is a very different album.  There are many styles, but they are all beautifully blended together to create a beautiful sound.  The music is very varied and the arrangements are amazing.  I was amazed by it and was very impressed.  I loved the sound quality and the ability to make the music sound like the artist had recorded it live.  The sound quality is spectacular.  The vocals are very clear and very powerful.  The music is very nice but I was disappointed that the CD is so short.  I would have preferred a live album.  I like the music but I think the CD would have been a great addition to the "live" music collection.  I will buy the CD if it is ever released.

Amazon review: Excellent recording of the songs from the album.  The sound is very good.  The songs are beautiful.  Some of the vocals were a little weak so it could be better in the future.

One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.

I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Re: Music CD

I ordered this CD from a local store online (i.e. Amazon) and it was delivered yesterday. It was defective and they claimed to have never had one of the said problems. After much research, I ordered another one and it was delivered today. It is defective and they did not know why. The store has the "return" policy and they did not have the CD (or the cover) in stock. It was the first time I have ever had a problem with an Amazon CD- they made it out to be defective! I called (on the internet) and they were apologetic and told me I had a defective one and they had it replaced. I have had 2 of the 3 cd's and both are defective. I will not be ordering any more and if Amazon ever makes a mistake again, I will make sure to not order from them on any future purchases.

Re: Music CD's

I'm a little disappointed that the first one was defective. I'm not a huge fan of the "bloat" of the music industry, but I certainly think that there should be a lot more quality control in the companies that sell music. I'm happy that they didn't put out a second batch that was defective, but I'm disappointed with them.

Amazon review: Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!

Amazon review: I purchased the song and the download. I love the song. I wish the download program would use the correct file for the song. It automatically changed the file size to 8 GB instead of the correct size of 3.5 GB. This is not a huge problem, however, when I was reading the file, the file size was not the correct size, but it was the correct size after I saved it. I then had to use the program to download the file to my computer. I had to wait a week to get the file that I was supposed to receive. It would be nice if you guys would make a program that would recognize the file size after you downloaded it.
