Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

He's a cool guy that has a good outlook on life and a great attitude to go with that.  What other Twiztid fam members have you checked out that weren't really in the spotlight?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is the first CD by this band. I liked them before I knew they were a band.  They play a sort of folk rock.  I really like the bass player's playing, but he's a little too much.  The lead singer is pretty, but I think he needs to sing a little more.  This is a good CD.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: In this CD I am listening to a collection of songs from the Great American Songbook. They are original songs, with no "cover tunes" or songs that are too similar to songs by other artists. The songs are mostly from the 20th Century, but there are some earlier songs that are represented. The songs are presented in chronological order, so the songs take on a life of their own over time. The original songs include "I Loves You Porgy," "Don't Fence Me In," "The Man From Laramie," "I Say a Little Prayer," "I Loves you Madly," and several others. The songs are sung in a variety of styles and in a variety of languages.

I always feel like I am in an episode of "The Real World".  I don't think I could stop listening to his songs for a week without getting a song stuck in my head.  I have listened to this song in multiple genres.  Its a great song.

I do not think that this album should be deleted, but if they are going to continue, maybe they should add something about how to make the castings.  It would be a good way to show the world how to make the castings.  I would recommend that they re-release this album.  I would also recommend that they re-release it and make an album with a lot of the castings that I have never seen before.  I would also recommend that they take the time to make a new album with all the castings that I have never seen before, because I have never seen these casts before, I would also recommend that they re-release this album and make an album of the castings that I have never seen before.  I would recommend that they re-release this album and make a new album of the castings that I have never seen before

Amazon review: This album is a total waste! I was actually interested in this album because of the fact that it was a double album and that some of the songs featured are very, very popular. I was really looking forward to hearing all the songs, but it is just as mediocre as it's predecessor. I don't understand why this album has been so poorly received. What is this? An album that is just filler songs for people who love "classic" rock? Or is this some type of "indie" album? I know there are a lot of people who do not get music like this and do not understand why people don't like it, but what is wrong with this music? Why is it so easy for people to call this an "indie" album when it's so poorly received?

Amazon review: I really dont know what to make of this album.  I like it, but there are some songs on it that I have never heard before, and some of the songs on it have not been heard for a very long time, so I am not sure if they are good or bad.  This album is the type of music that you would expect to hear in a old mall, but you would never expect to hear it in the middle of a city.  This album is the type of music where you would expect a lot of noise, but you would never expect to hear it in a quiet mall.  This album is the type of music that makes you want to go walk around the mall with the lights out, but you would never expect to hear it on a cold winter night.

This album is the type of music that makes you want go to the movies, but you would never expect to hear it in the middle of an invasion.

The first thing I notice is the first two notes of the guitar chord I recognize as Fmaj7. The third note that follows that is the third tone of the scale. The next note is the first tone of the scale. The notes to the right of the root are the third, sixth and ninth tones of the scale. The notes to the left of the root are the third, sixth and ninth tones of the scale in reverse order.

There are many things to do in Jackson but there is nothing you can do that is more relaxing than sitting on the beach with a cold drink and listening to music. The staff is great and their food is delicious. The beach is great and the live music is always good.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have this one to give to someone else.  I noted that when this music is played by Smooth Jax...there just is not enough other instruments in the music...I have now learned to buy Smooth Jazz productions that contain a variety of music from other musicians...

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I was really disappointed with this album. I'm not sure everyone who purchased this CD would be.  The sound was just not the same as the previous two albums.  While there are a few decent songs, there are way to many filler tracks.  In other words, this CD is boring.  It's not a waste of your time, but it is a waste of money.  I believe that this is a bad CD, but it is nothing compared to what you will find on the other two CDs.  If you hate Latin music, this is not for you.  If you love Latin music, or if you love this type of music, then this is a good CD.  However, if you are looking for a good CD that is not boring, this is not it.  If you are looking for a CD that is not boring, then get this CD...it is not the worst CD ever.  If you need a CD that is not boring, get this CD.

Amazon review: I have heard of this being one of the best albums by Puerto Rico.  It is very difficult to give a negative review of this type of music.  I had a hard time deciding which track to review...the first three tracks are the best tracks on the CD, but don't let that put you off.  It's a good album.  Although, I did have trouble deciding what to review first.  If you like Caribbean music, then you must get this album.  If you have heard of this CD, then you must get it.  If you are looking for something good, then get this CD.  If you are looking for something good, but not what you are looking for, then get this CD.  If you are looking for something good that is not what you are looking for, then get this CD.  It is a good CD, but it is not what I am looking for.  It is a good album.  However, let's be honest...this CD is not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The other two CDs that I have reviewed were the best CD's on the market.  However, this CD is not worthy of a one star rating.  I would recommend this CD to those who do not like Caribbean music.  This CD is good, but it is not worth it.  I did not find this CD enjoyable at all.  I would recommend this CD to those who do not like Caribbean material, but it is overpriced and not worth getting.

Amazon review: This is the second album by a Puerto Rican band that I have reviewed in the past few weeks...this is a good album...it is just a little over priced...but it is worth the money.  If you enjoy Latin music, you need to get this album.  If you love Latin music, or if you love this type...of music, then this is a good album...but it is not worth it.

I've been meaning to post a review on this CD, but I haven't had much time to do so.  I have been a fan of Latin music since I was a teenager, but there really wasn't anything that I liked when it came to Latin music that wasn't just a watered down version of what I had grown up with.  This album by Puerto Rico has been a long time coming.  It is their third album that I would consider a great one.  I was not sure what to expect of this album, but I was pleasantly surprised.  My ears tell me that I am not the first to enjoy this CD, but I am the first to enjoy the CD that I am reviewing.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: We're all familiar with the sound of Latin music...the way that it can be so different from any other type of music.  This is what makes it so great.  It is very difficult to describe the musical experience that I had when I first heard this CD.  It was so emotional.  It was very difficult for me to listen to this CD without crying.  I was able to relate to the content of this CD so much that I decided to write a review about this CD.  In my opinion, this is a great CD.  I was not a big fan of the first CD, but I thought this one was a good choice.  This CD is very different, but it is full of great lyrics.  There are great melodies and arrangements and the lyrics are very well written.  I hope that I can help a few people that are looking for a different type of music.  In my opinion, this is one of the best CDs that I have heard in a very long time.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I have the album 'Bob Johnson Sings the Blues'.  It has a few good songs on it, but it has some of the worst songs that I have ever heard.  I would not purchase it.  I would not say that I have a discography of Bob Johnson, because I do not.  I just remember listening to his music because he was the best blues musician that I have ever heard.  I have an album of old blues songs called 'The Blues Man's Album'.  It is a great album.  I would not buy the 'Bob Johnson Sings the Blues' album.  It is horrible.  I have a Bob Johnson cd that has some of his best songs on it.  It is a beautiful album that I will always have.  So, Bob Johnson is not my favorite blues musician.  He is just not my favorite person.  I love him and I just hate it that he is not my favorite blues musician.  I love his music, but I hate the things that he does.  He is a very talented artist and he is a very very nice person.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This album is an excellent collection of songs. The album starts off slow but picks up with the last song "Guts Over Fear".
