Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: The one thing that you will always find with the new R&B album is the production quality is always excellent.  This album can be played on practically any speaker and the sound is always clear, clean, and bright.  There are also more than a few songs that I can play on the radio and have no problem with.  The album is not bad by any means.  There are a couple of songs that I can't stand.  There is one song that just made me want to yell at all the men that are talking about a woman in the car that could have been mine.  And the song that just makes me want to slap every woman on the face that is sitting there being a bitch.  But on the whole, this is an excellent album.  Definitely worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for a while now and I have to say that it's not my favorite of the R&B's, but I love a lot of the songs, so I guess that's good enough for me.  I don't know if it's my taste or the music itself, but I don't like the beats to the songs on this album.  I guess it could be that I'm just an old white guy from the south trying to keep his southern roots alive.  If you know what I mean.  I really like a lot of the songs on this album.  If you only like a couple of songs, then this album is for you.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder.

The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I'm going to purchase a couple of the rest of the songs to listen to on my car stereo.

Amazon review: I don't really care for this artist but I was really happy to find this album by a good artist.  I don't really care for the music but I like that there were a few different artists on there.  So far I think the only bad thing about this album is that the song "I Want To Be Yours" didn't make it into the album.  Other than that I really like it!

Amazon review: I like the music on this album.  I do have a few complaints.  First, I didn't really like most of the songs that were on the album.  The two songs that I did like seemed to be the same song over and over.  Second, the length of the songs is not good.  You have to really listen before you can actually understand the lyrics.  The album is a little long, but I think that is what makes it so worth it.  I really enjoyed this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Reviews for The Eminem Show

I can't think of any artist who can match Eminem in the way he is able to express his opinion without being offensive or off base. Whether it's his music, his interviews, or his live shows, he is a master of his art.

Eminem is on a streak that may or may not be ending. He still has the songs on his new album that he is probably most famous for, but for the most part, his last couple of albums have been nothing but filler. This album is what he's been

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: i just can't believe how bad this album is.  I know it's not the best album ever but it's the worst I've ever heard.  I don't know what the heck are they thinking?  The singer, Mark Salling, is a total moron.  I'm not sure if he's deaf or just dumb.  The album is so bad that you can't even read the lyrics.  The first song, "In My Mind", is not even sung.  The next song, "What's The Worst That Could Happen", is so bad that it sounds like a man singing.  The worst song, "The Bad Guy", is so annoying that I'm not even sure if I'm listening to it.  But then, it's not the worst song on the album.  The worst song, "Love", is so bad that it's hard to believe that it's supposed to be a song.  The lyrics are so bad that I don't know if I'm listening to a man telling the truth or a liar.  But then, the album is not even bad.  It's just really bad.  I'd say the worst song is "I'm Not Your Man" because it just sounds like a man telling the truth.  The worst song is "You" because it's so bad that I think the singer is just a stupid man.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

However, my wife bought the CD for me before I could return it because she was tired of my endless complaining, so I decided to give this CD a try. To my surprise, I am a HUGE fan of this artist. I have been listening to this CD for almost a year now and I have not been disappointed yet. The one track that I did not like was the first one, but I am willing to give it another chance and see how I feel after listening to it again. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for something new and different.

Amazon review: I have loved the music of Dallas Holm from the very beginning. I really enjoyed the second CD. It was different and sounded like a big step up over the first CD. I am very excited to listen to the third CD. I have a feeling that some of the songs will be right on. I have heard the third CD many times and have not heard any changes in the way it sounds. The third CD is a great CD and I am really excited to hear it.

Amazon review: I thought that I would hate this CD. I was really disappointed in this CD. It is not the best CD that I have ever listened to. It is not a good CD. I was expecting a CD of the same quality of the first CD, but not this one. The CD does not have the original sound quality of the original CD. I thought that I would like this CD when I first purchased it, but I was disappointed. I am sure that I will get the CD that I have been looking for, but it is going to be a hard one to find.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was so excited to see the Schubert CD that I purchased today. When I read the description I was excited that it was Schubert, and I was very happy that it was in the classic box, too. Since I had already purchased the book, I was not interested in getting the CD. I had two other CDs already (one a compilation CD of Schubert songs and choral works), so I decided to go with the Schubert CD. I love the music, and the lyrics are very nice, too. They are well chosen. They are not just "pretty-sounding" that makes them great. I love the way that the vocals are blended in with the music. I also love that the vocals are very clear. I find that the vocals blend in very well with the music. I think that all of the songs on this CD are great. I think that they are all good. The songs are not just "pretty-sounding" that makes them great. The songs are great because they have a lot of meaning. They are all good. I love this album. I love the music. I love the lyrics.

Amazon review: I had a hard time deciding on my current favorites.  I really liked the "Love the Covers" video, but I really liked the "This Is How We Do" video, better than the "Love the Covers" video because it was more of a rock and roll song.  The first song to be played by B.o.B was "Bust a Move" and I really liked his lyrics in "Bust a Move".  The second song to be played by B.o.B was "Strawberry Rappin'".  It sounds like a song that was recorded by a couple of friends who were bored one day and just decided to come up with something.  I really liked the lyrics in "Strawberry Rappin'".  I really liked the album, I just wanted something a little more to the point and I wanted more songs.

I don't know what it is that makes them so unique but I guess it must be the fact that they just do not give a f*ck about any of the f*cking rules and just go out and do what they want to do.

I couldn't believe how good these songs were until I heard the new songs, and I'm so glad I listened to them.  Every song sounded like something else I'd never heard before.  I was blown away with this band.  I knew when I saw them live that I would like them and I did.  I am very glad that I bought this CD because I am so glad that I listened to them.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album about one hundred times already.  I have a great appreciation for anything done by the Beatles.  They took a bunch of stuff from other groups and made it their own.  I have listened to this album for a few weeks now and I can't seem to find a single flaw in it.  That is until I listen to this song, "I Feel Fine".  It is a simple song, but it is so incredibly painful to listen to.  The lyrics are beautiful and it has a simple but great melody.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

###
Amazon review: This is the worst album I have ever heard. The lyrics are terrible, the song has no melody, the instrumentation is terrible and the production is so low it makes the vocals look like they are coming from a cheap, tinny speaker. It is so bad that I started to put it on my "to listen to" list but then I realized the album is a joke. This will not go on my "listen to" list.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Love love love this song. I love the lyrics, love the melody, love the instrumentation. I don't know why I liked it so much. It was horrible. I am so disappointed in the music industry. So disappointed. I have listened to this album over 50 times. I have tried to erase the songs from my brain, but I can hear it in my head.

Amazon review: This song has gotten a lot of attention for being the most original of all the artists on the album. It is a song about life. It was not written to be what it is. It is just what it is. Some people may hate it, but it is what it is. I love it. I do not think I have been able to listen to this song enough times to say exactly what I think about it. I have heard it on so many different occasions and it has never changed. I have heard it played by so many different bands, but I do not think anyone has ever changed it. It is my favorite.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the song, but I do not like the lyrics. The lyrics make no sense at all. The song is about a girl who leaves her friend because she feels she is not giving her enough attention. This is not what the lyrics say. The lyrics also talk about the girl's boyfriend cheating on her and leaving her. I do not like this song. The lyrics are just wrong. I do not think the song is funny. I do not think it is the best song on the album.

Amazon review: The song is an original, not a cover of an original. It is a very good song. It is catchy, catchy, catchy. It has a good beat to it, good lyrics, good beats. The beat is very good and the lyrics are very good. I like the song. I like it a lot. It is a good song. It is not the best song, but it is a good song. I do not have much to say about this song because I really like it. I hope someone else likes it. I hope that person would buy it and like it. I hope they would like it enough to buy it.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD but when I got done with it I realized it was a complete waste of money.  I didn't even listen  to a single song.  It felt like I was listening to a generic CD, not a true hip hop recording.  I'm not a fan of the artists but the album was too generic to bother listening to. I could have listened to the same songs over and over and still enjoyed them.

This is a great album.

Amazon review: I've gotten this CD a few times and I keep coming back to it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think your review shows a lot about your own taste and musical taste.  I personally like to listen to a variety of music.  I really enjoy the western songs, but I do not always feel that I want to listen to them.  I have to admit I am a fan of Clint Eastwood.

Amazon review: I have tried to listen to the album twice, and I just can't get into it.  It's not bad, but it just seems like there are a lot of repetitions in the songs.  The album is very repetitive, and the songs seem to be the same every time I listen to it.  The lyrics are not very good either.  I like the music, but the lyrics are not that good.  I would have given the album a 3.5 star rating if it wasn't for the fact that I'm not a Clint fan.  I have to give the album a 1 star rating because it would be a waste of money to go out and buy a movie where you can't recognize the music.
