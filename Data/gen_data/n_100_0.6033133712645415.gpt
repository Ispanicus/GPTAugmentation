Amazon review: Awol Nation is a fun, upbeat pop-rock band from the US.  My wife plays the violin, and her parents play the piano.  They wrote a song called "The Last Goodbye" that we performed at our wedding.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear the song performed live, but was still worried that it would be a huge disappointment for my wife and parents.  I was wrong.  It was absolutely stunning.

Amazon review: It's so sad how I can't stand Awol Nation, but I will buy their album and will rate it 5 stars.  My wife plays the violin and has written this song.  She's an inspiration to me.  I'm still waiting to hear the rest of the album.  Allan Boles

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.

Amazon review: I like this album. I like the Dave Clark Five.  I wish they would have spent more time with the other members of the band.  This is not a bad album at all, just average, and it seems like they are trying to recreate the sound of the early 60s.  It doesn't sound like they are trying to get on with it or do anything different.  It just sounds like a cover band with guitars, drums, bass, and vocals.  I have played this album many times since I purchased it and each time I listen to it I just laugh at the joke of it all.  It is not bad, it just is not worth paying $20 for, and I will not be buying it on CD when I can get a much better version for free on youtube.  I would recommend this album to people who actually enjoy music, but know when to stick to the classics.  This is their best album, but I do wish that they would work on the other members of the band.  They need to work on their vocals more... but I don't blame them for trying.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

A:

This is the best album on this site, and possibly of all time.

This album is perfect.
It's everything I wanted from the original era of trance, and more. It's got the good old melodies, the great vocals, the great electronic beats, and the great production. I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to it without getting emotional (I'm not sure if it's a positive or negative emotion).

I've been listening to this album for the past two days now, and I can't recommend it enough, even if you really like only one song out of this album.

I did a lot of searching for this, but ended up with nothing which I could enjoy.

I stumbled upon this by accident while looking for a similar album, and found it to be a great one. This album not only has the same "feel" as the original era, but also holds up as well as any other album of this sort. It is not a perfect album, but it's great.

I've listened to it for the past three days, and I'm sorry to say that I don't like it at all. It's just not my thing. I will, however, give it a positive rating because the music is pleasant enough. However, the songs just aren't that great.

This album is good, very good, and has got to be the best trance album of all time. If I had to give an honest rating, this is a 6.5 out of 10.

I was looking for this album for a while, so I thought I would give it a try. I've listened to this album 3-4 times now, and while at first I wasn't that impressed, this album is really good. It contains some of the best trance songs I've ever heard and it also has some nice songs like "Love is all you need" and "Love is a Drug".

For me, this is the one and/or only trance album I'll listen to until the end of my life.

I am not sure if I should give this album a 4 or 5 out of 5. Some of the songs have absolutely beautiful melodies. I would say that the lyrics are not terrible, but they are not as good as they could be. The vocals are good, but not as good as they could be. If I had to give this album a rating, I would say that it is good. But I would not recommend it.

I would say that this is one of the best trance albums of all time.

I was looking forward to this album for a while and was really hoping to like it. It just didn't happen. I have listened to this album for the past 4 days and I still can't get into it.

The song "Love is a Drug", the song "Love is all you need" and "Love is a drug" are my favorite songs out of this album.

I am not sure if I should give this album a 1, 2 or 3 out of 10. Some of the songs have absolutely beautiful melodies. I am not much of a trance fan, but this album is really good. I love the title track "Love is a Drug". It is probably my favorite song of this album.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

This is the first time I've looked at this album and there are a few things I want to mention.

1.) Every song on this album is incredible. From the opening one through the end, there is nothing not to love. The album is perfect.

2.) I love the simplicity of the music but it has a heavy dose of emotion.

3.) The message is clear, it's about a "woman" who "fears the life of a nun and loves the life of a wife and mother". I think it's a great message.

4.) The artwork is beautiful. It's not a fan art, but a painting that was done by an actual artist who got it done for the album.

5.) I love the way the album is recorded. All of the tracks are done live and just like the live performance, each track is full of life and energy.

6.) I love the lyrics and I love the way the album flows. It is very well done.

7.) Overall, this is a very well done album and it's perfect for a listening pleasure. I like the way it flows and the message is clear.

4.5/5 stars.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really fun song.  I like the vocals and the guitar work (the distortion, the tom tom stuff) but the song is just...ugh.  The bass is good, but not great.  There's some very good guitar work, though.  The drumming is pretty good, but they don't really have a good feel to them.  The vocal harmonies are OK, but the song has a very generic quality to it.  And the song is so predictable - I couldn't listen to it over and over again.  Even the lyrics are predictable - "I wanna say something / I wanna talk to you," and so on.  It's really a pity.  I'm not sure if this was meant for a radio single with a little more variety, or if they just made this song to fill a slot.  But I'm pretty sure it was meant to be on a radio single.  The only thing that really redeems it is the guitar solo.  That's really good.  But it's not the best part.  It's a good song, but not a great one.

This CD is so bad I could not understand a word I was listening to.  The only good thing is that the CD is in the correct order.

Amazon review: I got this disc to help me practice for a singing contest.  I would not get a good recording of me because I was singing flat and had no attitude.   The recording that I got was not recorded flat and was not singing with any attitude.  I could not understand a word that was being sung.  The singer had no attitude.  She just sung like a robot.  I feel a lot of people who get this disc are getting their voice to sound really terrible.

Amazon review: I received this cd to practice for a karaoke competition.  It was nothing more than a 5 minute recorded of a singer at a concert who did not know how to sing, and was singing in a foreign language.  The recording was taken out of context and sold as a CD as part of a series.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I'm really not a fan of her music in the first place.  I like her voice, but I don't love her music.  Her music is very similar to the music of other artists such as Joss Stone and Lyle Lovett.  I'd rather listen to the musicians who have been influenced by the artists she's been influenced by.  I do like Joss Stone's music, but it's not Jewel's.  And Lyle Lovett's music is not Jewel's either, so it's a little unfair to compare them.

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised by this CD.  I was expecting a lot more than this CD has.  I got to the first song, "The Sound Of Music" and couldn't find my voice.

Overall, I would say she has improved with each album she releases.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Jewel's since her first CD "Dreaming".  I have been very disappointed with her music since then.  This is definitely one of the worst albums I have ever heard.  The music is not bad, it's just Jewel's.  It's horrible.  The songs are repetitive and boring.  The vocals are horrible.  The lyrics are terrible.  "The Star" is the worst.  It's just a shame that I was so used to Jewel's amazing voice on "Dreaming" that I am forced to listen to this.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  If you enjoy this kind of music there is no such thing as a "bad band."  Check out this band.  I'm not sure if any of you have ever heard the band, but they're on my favorite band list.  The band is called  The Big Lebowski, and they have released 7 albums.  The 7th album is called  The Big Lebowski (The New Album).  I have only heard the first album through the CD.  I am very much looking forward to hearing the new album.  I have heard some of the songs on the first album.  The songs on the first album don't sound as good as the new album.  But the band has just started getting their second album out and it will be out in the new year.  So look out for the new album.  I really like all of their albums so far.  The band has been around since the 90's.  They are a very good band.  I highly recommend you check out this band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the first CD of  The Big Lebowski.  It's kind of like a big band version of  The Doors meets  The Beach Boys, that is until the vocals are over.  This album is full of great songs.  I really love the song "The Ballad of Andy Kaufman".  The other songs on the album are also very good.  And if you dig the movie, you should check out the soundtrack too.  The movie is a great movie and the soundtrack will put you in the right mood for the movie.  My favorite song is "You're Gonna Miss It All".  I like the way the band plays jazz, blues and rock & roll.  The band has also released a couple of other albums.  The first one is called  The Big Lebowski Volume One.

Amazon review:  This album is a great album.  I was looking for a new album to buy and I found this one.  I listened to the CD a little over a week ago.  I have to admit that I was a little bit surprised by the CD.  It is a lot more upbeat than I was expecting.  The CD sounds different than the CD I had heard before.  I don't want to say it's better, but it is certainly different from the CD I had before.  It's good, but its not great.  It is a lot of fun.  You can really tell that you are listening to a really good album.  This is the kind of album I like.  It's not a perfect album.  But it is a lot of fun.  It is very easy to listen to.  The songs are mostly great.  And I really like the first CD of this album.  This album is one of those CDs that you just can't put down.  If I had a recommendation for an album to buy I would go for this one.

Amazon review:  I have listened to this album a lot.  I have played it over and over.  I like the songs.  But I don't like the band.  I have heard this band before, but I have never heard it like this.  The band sounds very old school.  They sound like they are playing a song from a 70's TV show.  They are very old and very conservative.  The band is called  The Big Lebowski and they are from Houston.  The band is very good.  The band has been around since the 90's.  It has a lot of energy and a lot of fun.  I have really liked all their albums so far.  The band has been around since the 90s.  I have only heard the first album called  The Big Lebowski.  The band has not released anything else since then.  But I really like the band.  The band has a lot of energy and a lot of fun.

Amazon review: This is a very nice CD that was given to me by an old friend.  I was surprised when it was played for the first time and I was amazed when it was played a second time.  I must say that the sound quality on this CD is amazing.  I have listened to it several times and it sounds as good as it did the first time I listened to it.  The only problem is that it can take quite a while to play.  When I first started listening to it it took me about 2 hours to listen to all of the songs on it.  I've listened to it more times since then and I know that I have listened to it for about 2 hours and 20 minutes and it still is playing.  This is a great CD and should be highly in demand.

Amazon review: Excellent song and music. The lyrics and chorus are very well written, and I really enjoyed listening to this song.  The instrumental part was also very nice.  The only complaint I have is that I wish the song was longer.  When I was driving back home from the beach I didn't want to stop and listen to this song, but then I remembered that I had a lot of driving to do.  I will definitely listen to the whole song.  The song and music are great.

I am not sure what I am going to do with it, but I will try and play it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and ever again.  This CD is very long, but I really love it.  I would just give this CD high ratings.

Ami:
Thank you for the review! I have never tried to contact you, but hope you will accept my comments. It seems many people have been asking me about my CD. I wish to respond to this post. I have never been in the Christian music business, but I wanted to share with you my new CD. My CD is called "Worship."
I have been singing for 18 years. I have written over 35 songs and recorded over 80 songs for my CDs. I wrote the songs and recorded them all on the piano. My music is very traditional, and was written to be sung in church, as well as in homes and small groups.
I am currently recording my CD. It is an album of worship songs. The songs are very high quality, and I am very excited about this project.
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to your review of my album. I really appreciate your support, and I hope

Amazon review: I was looking for a "rock" album this weekend and stumbled upon this.  The album cover looks like a music magazine cover, with a guitar strapped to it, and a large, black plastic globe of a planet in the background.  The music is very good, and the sound is not just a little better than some of the other records I've heard, but it is better than a lot of the other records I've heard.  The only real downside is that the CD has a lot of scratchy, digital distortion, and the album is very, very thin.  I would have preferred the same amount of detail in the sound, and more of a real recording.

Amazon review: Some albums are great, but this is one of them.  I had heard the "new" Hammond organ album, "The Hammond Organ Collection" by the late, great, Steve Morse.  It was a nice listen, but it didn't blow me away.  "The Hammond Organ Collection" is the sequel to a CD Steve Morse made that was originally released in 1992.  Steve Morse has now been dead for two years, but his music lives on, and not on the CD.  Steve Morse was a musician of great talent, and one of the best players in the history of the Hammond organ.  He made some beautiful recordings, and this album is a must-have for any Hammond fan.  Steve Morse was one of the greatest of all time.  This album is one of my favorite things I have ever heard and I have had my share of great musical experiences.  I hope this album inspires other Hammond fans to seek out Steve Morse's music.  If you are a fan of his, this album is for you.  I highly recommend it.

Amazon review: Steve Morse was a great musician and a great man.  This album is outstanding.  Steve was one of the best.  This is the definitive version of his music.

Amazon review: This is the best early Steve Morse album.  Every aspect of this is wonderful.  This is one of the rarer Steve Morse releases, and I am really enjoying it.  This is one of my favorite records, and I am glad I bought it.  This album is worth every penny.  I do have a copy of this CD which was taken from a friend's collection, and I purchased that copy.  I am hoping to sell this copy, but I am not sure if it is worth anything.  Anyways, I have played it 3 times and I would like to hear it a fourth time.  Please feel free to comment, and let me know if I can help you.

Amazon review: This album is excellent.  I love the recordings.  You have to hear them to truly understand the musicianship they represent.  The music is superb.  It is not difficult to see why this album has received such acclaim.  Steve Morse was one of the greatest and most talented organists of his time.  This is a must have for any Hammond fan, and for anyone interested in the history of the instrument.  This album is a must for any Hammond fan.  This album is a classic and a keeper.  I would recommend this to everyone.
