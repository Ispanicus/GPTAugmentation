Amazon review: I know most of the reviews here are from people that know Danny or listen to him producing an AM talk show and have a certain affinity for him. Their reviews seem a little biased at best. The truth is that while this album definitely calls back to old country music, it does so in the most generic way possible. Nothing here is really worth listening to more than once, and really once you've gotten to the chorus of each song you've pretty much heard all of it.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording, which is often far from modern convention.  I personally think this is one of the best that I have heard of.  The sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical.  Maybe Martzy is a bit on the same page with Haendel and Grumiaux.  Quite far from Heifetz, Milstein and younger violinists.  If you like more objective styles, this is not the best option.  Stay with Szeryng or Milstein.

Amazon review: What is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off.  I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE. By calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each CD you end up with almost an hour of unused space. to leave tracks such as Take It Away/Ballroom Dancing/Tug of War/C Moon/Vanilla Sky/Helen Wheels/Bluebird etc off was just inexcusable.

Amazon review: I couldn't download all 930 or so mp3s from the cloud player without clicking them 1 at a time. However, thanks to amazon showing that this resource exists for free, I was able to find the site "bible.is". On that site they have the complete Bible, plus they have both dramatized and non-dramatized versions of KJV, NASB, ESV, and contemporary English. If this product didn't need to be downloaded through cloud player, I would have given it a 4/5 stars.

Amazon review: This CD is an excellent choice for anyone who enjoys classical music.  In fact, we made our son's violin teacher request this CD after hearing the original recording with the original violinist.  The violin is very beautiful and she really loved it!

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

Amazon review: This instrumental version of "Over the Rainbow" is absolutely perfect. It seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why I'm saying it's good.

Amazon review: This second single from the new album "Rise" (releasing June 25) is more of a power ballad.  John Cooper's strained voice shows more here than on most of their rock songs, but it is still a good song with a great message, of letting love cut through the noise of our culture.  If you are familiar with Skillet, think along the lines of Lucy (although American Noise is not a story song).  If you are not familiar with the band, just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80's rock band.

Amazon review: Found this song looking for the perfect backdrop music for my Mexican Vacation folder on my personal website. It fit the bill perfectly as it is an excellent instrumental spanish guitar peace that does not overwhelm the web browsing experience, but was a delightful addition instead.

Amazon review: What is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that was left off.  I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE. By calculations if you add up all the blank space at the end of each CD you end up with almost an hour of unused space. to leave tracks such as Take It Away/Ballroom Dancing/Tug of War/C Moon/Vanilla Sky/Helen Wheels/Bluebird etc off was just inexcusable.

Guitar Hero III Standard Edition

I really like this game, there are so many different things you can do with it. The only problem is that when you go to buy it, you can't buy it on the website because it has a limit of 5 copies per person. So, it's really difficult to get this game. I'm a big fan of the guitar hero game's. I loved playing my guitar and singing. I really looked forward to playing this game every time it came out. I really like this game but it doesn't seem like it's getting a lot of play. I hope it is because if it was a lot more played, maybe more people would buy it. It's definitely going to be a little bit pricey for me to buy it. I would want a few copies. The only thing that would be nice would be if you could buy it for like $20 and it would be free shipping.

I really like this app. It's a great app to learn guitar. It has plenty of songs. It's well-organized, so I don't have to search the internet for songs to learn. I really like the way the guitar lessons are arranged. It's easy to follow along and get the answers to all the questions. The songs are well-written and easy to learn and play. I like that the lessons are arranged in different categories. For example, some lessons are about basic chords, which are easy to learn and play. Others are about scales, which are more challenging to learn and play. This app is great, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys learning guitar.

Amazon review: I don't think Mozart purists would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpts or single movements from various works, but I bought this for my kids and it really is an entertaining, first-rate, diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of Mozart.

I've been listening to the CD for about an hour now and I love it.  It's absolutely wonderful.  I really enjoyed the collection of music on this album.  I thought it was perfect for my son.  I love the fact that it is a complete collection.  There are no short cuts, or single songs that you have to skip over.  It's not a collection that you listen to to get to a certain song.  As a parent, I enjoy getting to know the songs in the collection.  It's really cool to hear one song and be able to hear another song from the same album.  It's almost like having a CD that has a bonus track on the bottom.

It's a good mix of jazz, pop, rock, and children's songs.  I would rate it a 10/10.  I just love it.  I have a really hard time putting my finger on why I like it so much, but I find it enjoyable.

Amazon review: Zipper Catches Skin was far better than many of the reviewers here seem to think.  If you're stuck in the early 70's-or bust mentality of Cooper-fandom, then this album isn't for you.  But ZCS is strong from beggining to end, with catchy tunes and interesting lyrics which at times border on the hilarious.  "Adaptable", "I Like Girls", "Remarkably Insincere", all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them, mainly because of the lyrics.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

Amazon review: Its sad to see him going down the same path as Brad Paisley and putting out this type of garbage. I can't not help but laugh at how bad this song is when I hear it.

Amazon review: When I first played this CD, I thought to myself that the singer did not sound like Johnny Rodriguez.  Then I looked at the cover of the CD and noted the following:  "All selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group."  Not sure what this is supposed to mean, but to me the singing does not sound like the Johnny Rodriquez that I am used to. Don't waste your money on this unless you like Johnny Rodriquez songs that sound like they are being sung by someone else.

It is a collection of great songs that he was able to write. His voice shines through on every track and the band is great. The only problem I have with this CD is that the songs do not have an interesting tune or rhythm to them. The other problem is the songs just do not sound like good, young, easy listening music.

Amazon review: The first thing I noticed with this album was the great musicianship of the band. The other thing I noticed was the quality of the vocals. The first track I came across was "Suspicious Minds" which is a very good song. The second track was "Soft Winds" which was also good. I had heard that the third track was "Cha-Cha" and I thought that it was good but I was wrong. I thought that it was one of the best songs on the record and it was. It is one of the best songs on the album and will be remembered for a long time. I think that the album is great for anyone who likes old jazz standards.

This compilation is first rate, and I hope that students will ask their directors to program on or more of these selections for an upcoming concert or festival.  I hope directors will take the time to listen and say to themselves "Yeah, my band can play this!" I first heard of Stephen Melillo's music as a college student.

Amazon review: Nothing new here, except the packaging. This collection is the first time inclusion of "singles" from their recent lackluster album "That's Why God Made The Radio". The reason I highlight "singles" is because, what the heck is a single these days? Although there was actually a 45 rpm 7" vinyl "single" issued of "That's Why God Made The Radio", it was just issued only for, probably, collectors like me. The other new "single", "Isn't It Time", only exists on the album.

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.

It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!

The album is in great shape, with clear vinyl and a nice clear plastic sleeve.  The quality of the vinyl is excellent.  The only negative thing I have to say is the fact that the new album does not have the original artwork on the front and the back.  Instead it has a clear plastic cover with a clear vinyl cover on the inside and the back.  The other issue I have is that the new album has a different cover on the inside.  The old one was a clear plastic cover with a clear vinyl cover on the inside and the outside.  The new one seems to be a clear plastic cover with a clear plastic vinyl cover on the inside and the outside.  I would have liked to have seen the old album on the back of the new album, but I guess that is not the way it happened.  Overall I am very happy with this album.

Amazon review: I have heard of this band before.  They are known for their "Jungle" album and a couple of other songs, but when I was told that they are on this compilation, I was curious.  I like their "The World Is Mine" song, but I would not say that it is a new song.  I like the way that it is played.  It has a nice rythmic beat and a nice bass line.  I guess I have heard it before, but I have been listening to their "Jungle" album, so I guess I just have to look up the song on Amazon.  The rest of the album is also a nice collection of bands from the 90s.  The songs "The World Is Mine" and "The Girl Who Saved The World" are both great songs, and I have been listening to them since they were released on the album.  The "The Girl Who Saved The World" is a great song.  I guess I will have to check out more of their stuff, but I am still a little unsure about this one.

Amazon review:  This album is by a band that I am very proud of.  The band is called "KHUM".  They are from the Los Angeles area and they are a great band.  They play a very groovy type of music that I like.  They are a new band, but they are a great new band.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album since I bought it.  I have heard it all before.  I have been listening to this album since I bought it.  I am a big fan of the albums that are remastered, but this one is a new release.  I am sure there are a lot of people who have heard the band on other albums, but this is the one I have been listening to the most.  It is a great album, and I will definitely buy a copy of this one.  The songs are great.  The songs "I Don't Know" and "The World Is Mine" are great songs.  The songs "The World Is Mine" and "The Girl" are great songs.  I wish I had a video of the band performing, but I don't.  I will have to go and get the album and listen to it.

I was so impressed the last couple of years watching these kids grow up and enjoyed their covers of my favorite classic rock bands and some of their own creations like "a piece of rock and roll" and "drama queen", (very good songs) but this Eternalize CD fell way short.  Musically these kids are very talented and great musicians, however I thought the song writing was bad, the lyrics bad, and the vocals were bad - vocals were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling.

Amazon review: I saw Paul Simon live 2 days before this album came out. Usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff, you generally don't want to hear it, you wanna hear the hits. This was a special case. He played about 5 or 6 songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more. I was blown away. He talks about how he spent some time in the Amazon, going on a spiritual journey, drinking this "root tea" which turned out to be ayahuasca, and seeing spirits.

Amazon review: As much as I can scream out Expletives about the GRRRRRREATNESS of QAF the show, the soundtrack falls sadly mediocre.  It touts itself as ALMOST LIKE being in BABYLON (a dancejoint that does not exist in real life), well I guess it does in a way, but it doesn't capture the whole feel of BABYLON. I was expecting remixes and stuff!  WHERE IS IT? On the whole I guess its an O.K. compilation.  A lot of you won't really get what I am saying but, that's okay too.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was very surprised to hear that Little House on the Prairie was reissued this year, and I was impressed with the re-packaging.  I was especially pleased to see that the first album had been re-released as a 2 CD set with the new songs in the first disc, and the rest of the songs in a separate second disc.  The music was all new again, and, most of all- I was happy to find that there was no trace of the "new and improved" quality that had been mentioned by others in the past.  The songs on the second disc were the ones Laura Ingalls Wilder had originally recorded in the 1930s, except for the "Little Bit" tune.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I received this as a gift from a friend.  I hadn't heard the songs before, and the first one on the disc is "The Old Barn", which I didn't care for at all.  I was pleasantly surprised by the second disc, however.  I didn't care for several of the songs, but the ones I did like were "The Old Barn", "The Little Boy", and "The Old Schoolhouse".  I like the first one on the first disc best, however, and I can't imagine anyone not liking it.

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this disc.  I had been waiting for this disc for months, but had to wait another two months for the CD to come in the mail.  I was impressed with the album, and the quality of the recording was excellent.  The lyrics were good too.

Amazon review: This review is only for this version of the album (the remastered expanded edition). The mastering sounds overly compressed, and Eddie's vocals don't sound loud enough. The instruments sound way too loud and it drowns out Eddie's voice on some of the tracks.  It baffles me how record companies can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original albums. People are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album.

It has been said that if you can see beyond the shiny surface of the Amazon review, you will find that the review actually reflects your customer's opinion. That is how I came to read your Amazon reviews. The reviews are not always what they seem to be. I am not just looking for an honest review, I am looking for a review that really shows how the customer feels. And, it is rare that you will find a review that reflects you in a positive way.

I have been a member of Amazon for over 10 years now. I enjoy the selection, the price, the shipping time and the overall service. I also enjoy the Amazon community. I am a member of the Amazon review team. I would like to share what I think about the Amazon community with the community.

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I pre ordered this record, so you can imagine the amount of excitement I had when it arrived. I was all but kissed the delivery man when it came! I ran straight up to my record machine and played it, probably around 3 times before giving poor dierks a break. I listened to the record about 5 times after that before the unthinkable happened. "It's different for girls" began to SKIP! I was in shambles! On my fourth time of playing one of my favorite records it was skipping!

Amazon review: I'll start off by saying I like blink 182 and also alkaline trio. When I heard skiba joined the band I figured we would get a awesome mesh, we didn't.  I thought Tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark, very mediocre effort. There are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy. I get that the album is named California but how many times do we need that forced down our throats. And you guys are too old to be singing about being teenagers anymore,  let's grow a little.

Amazon review: I do not like this album.  I don't think this is the worst of Tane's work because it is a mix of genres,  but I do not like the fact that it is almost entirely pop-song style in my opinion.  Also the vocals are weak.  I really do not like the first song (the first song that I heard)  but I do like the second song,  which is basically a ballad.  I do not think that this album is for me.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times because Tane is my favorite singer,  and I wanted to hear what her sound would be like.

I didn't listen to it anymore until I heard that it was being released on CD.

I don't understand why Tane would release a song about a guy that she doesn't like,   I thought this song was a hit.   I don' like the album because it is too much of the same thing over and over.   I don't understand why Tane would release a song that was not a hit.   I don't understand why Tane would release songs about guys that she doesn't like.

Amazon review: I had extremely high expectations for Mumford & Sons new album "Babel" after listening to their first release over and over.  So not too surprisingly I was a little disappointed at first.  But after a few plays through, it grew on me and, while I still believe "Sigh No More" is better album, "Babel" is still a great CD of its own right.

Amazon review: It pains me to see so many 1 star reviews coming from Dylan's own fan base.  I have been a fan for over 40 years, and I cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered.  Bob Dylan's voice has been shot for quite a few years now, but that hasn't stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like "Modern Times".  This holiday outing is not laughable as some have stated, but it is an embarrassment that Columbia records released it in the first place, and in the process exposed Dylan's now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a true masterpiece- It has a brilliant sound, and Dylan's voice has never sounded better.  He is singing of the life he has lived, and it makes me cry so hard, that I can hear myself in his singing and the harmonies.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't know if this is the best Dylan album ever, but it is the best Dylan album of the 70's.  It is filled with classic Dylan tunes and some really great songs.  The lyrics are beautiful, and it is a reminder of what a great songwriter Dylan was (as well as a great singer).  I have been a fan of Dylan for a long time, and this is probably my favorite album of his.  I love the songs on this one, but I love the whole album so much more.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have only listened to this song once before.  It is the only song I know that I can not hear without having my heart in my throat and breathing so heavily that it hurts.  The chorus is so powerful, and after listening to it like that, I can almost hear the emotion in it.  I was so in love with you, baby, I can't believe I ever stopped loving you, and I won't stop, I've got to have you.

Amazon review: Great album, this time Dylan has gone with the ballads.  I think that the two songs that I like the most on this album are "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" and "Maggie's Farm".  These two songs really bring out the beauty of Dylan's voice.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an album that I would recommend.  It is not a typical Dylan release, and it is worth the listening.  I have always been a fan of Dylan's, and this album has brought me to a whole new level of appreciation.  There is a new Dylan album coming out, that is bound to be another classic.  I am looking for it, and I am sure that I will have it, as soon as I can find it.

Amazon review: "Gravity" by The Wallflowers is a great song.  I have not heard "Gravity" but I have heard "Don't Let Me Down".  To me the Wallflowers sound like a mix of Tom Petty and John Cougar Mellencamp. So I would recommend this a song that you can add to your playlist.

Amazon review: This album is a hit for the band, especially on the live show.  However, I am not one for this type of music, so I just skipped the first two songs.  The songs "I'll Be There" and "You Make Me Feel..." are catchy.  The songs "I Don't Want to Know" and "I Wanna Be with You" are well-sung, and "I Don't Want to Know" is very good.  The album is only a two-hour hour, so it would be good if the songs were longer.  The song "I'll Be There" is my favorite.  I love the song "You Make Me Feel...".  The band is a great group, and they sound like they're having a good time.  This is the type of band that could be a hit with the mainstream, and it would be great if they could make a follow-up album.  I could be wrong about this, but I doubt it.  I don't like the song "You Make Me Feel..." and I think it sounds like the band is trying too hard.  There are also some filler songs here and there.  I would recommend this album to the mainstream, but not to the music fan.  The band is good, but there are some songs that are annoying and filler.  This is not the album for the music fan.

I would recommend this CD to anyone, but if you are a fan of this band and want to support them, I would recommend buying them a new CD as they are on tour.  This CD does not have any special features that you would normally get with a CD, but I just bought this CD because I like this band so much.  If you like this band, you should buy this.  I love the music.  It is great to hear their music over and over again.  I would recommend this band to anyone who likes this type of music.  This CD is not bad but you can have the same albums on CD, or I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes to see them live.

His guitar playing has absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sounds ancient.
