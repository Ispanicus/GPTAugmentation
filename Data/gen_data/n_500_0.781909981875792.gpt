Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I bought the Beatles "I Want to Hold Your Hand" album. I am a huge Beatles fan. I didn't buy every album, but I have gone through all the albums by the Beatles. This is one of them. I had listened to the Beatles' music since I was about 10 years old. This was the first time I had bought a Beatles album. I really liked it and I was excited to get it. I was very disappointed, however, when I opened the package. The album cover was torn out of the sleeve and the cover was now a big rip. The album title and the lettering was also ripped. The album had 2 songs on it that were actually on the Beatles' albums (in addition to what was on the album). I feel this album is a little better than the others, but it was still a very disappointing album. The 2 songs were "All You Need Is Love" and "Help!". I would not buy Beatles music again.

Amazon review: The "Hurry Up and Wait" song is one of the biggest hits of all time. It is a song that is constantly heard on the radio. The lyrics are about someone who is waiting around for something to happen. The song was originally sung by The Beach Boys and was written by Dennis Wilson, who was actually a Beach Boy at the time. The song was re-recorded by The Beatles in 1970 and was first released on the album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."  The song has been covered by many other artists such as The Turtles, The Monkees, The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones.

Amazon review: I bought "The Beatles - The Beatles Anthology." I am a huge Beatles fan and I like to buy these kind of albums to hear their most famous songs.

The only song I like is "I Will" and "You Know My Name". The reason I like the songs that I do like is that they are really good ones.

Amazon review: I got this book, and I am amazed at all of the things that I missed. I am just beginning to read about the history of the Civil Rights movement. I am amazed at how all of this happened. I just recently learned that Martin Luther King Jr., was the first President of the United States, and I am amazed at all of the things that he accomplished, and how he managed to be the first and the most influential person in the history of the United States. If you haven't read the book "I'll Be There for You" by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., read it. I highly recommend it!  It takes you from his childhood in Atlanta, to his early days in the South, to his march on Selma, Alabama, to his imprisonment, to the march on Washington, D.C., to his assassination, to the march on Washington, D.C., to his funeral and the marches in Memphis and across the country, and finally on to his life after his death.

I've come across alot of bands that use their own style to write their own songs; which is the way it should be done. I've heard this band before and I'm yet to get into them, but I have to say that this is by far the worst album i've ever heard in my life. This album is the same as all the other bands out there that are using the same style and sound to write their own songs. I've always liked punk and pop bands, but this is just too annoying.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: This album is the best band I have ever heard. Their music is different and not like anything else out there. Their music has good guitar riffs, good lyrics, and great vocals.

Amazon review: This album is a little weird to me. For one, I don't like the lyrics, so I'd say it's a mixed bag, but the other thing that bothers me is that it's been a long time since I heard a good rock band that wasn't actually a cover band.  I mean, I've heard plenty of covers, but I've never heard a band that didn't try to do something original. The band is good, but it may be because their original material is so good.

I'm not sure what I was expecting from the album, but this isn't it. It's good to hear that it's a "rock" album, and to see that they are continuing to evolve their sound, but the music is just not good or entertaining enough to warrant it. The lyrics are not bad, probably my favorite on the album, but I've heard better. The music is just generic, and the only reason I can think of to purchase this album, was to see if they could still write a decent song after all these years.
I give it a thumbs down.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2.

You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: This is my first CD by Josh and I have to say this is a very nice introduction to the music of Josh, I like the fact that it contains a small sample of each of his other albums - I know there are a few that are incomplete or missing, but I don't mind that, what I do mind is that there are a few tracks that he's not been in his other work since, I'd like to hear more of his work that he's been in since his return.

Amazon review: This is a nice CD with a few songs that I haven't heard by Josh before, but I don't mind that because I like what I hear. The tracks are mostly guitar based and have a nice melody to them, the songs flow nicely and you can tell he is very passionate about what he does.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

I'm just not a fan of this type of music, and I've heard a lot worse, but this is one of the few albums I've purchased in recent time that has had a negative experience.  I'm glad I purchased this one, and I will probably purchase a few more.

Amazon review: I have been meaning to check out this album for awhile, but I had some life stuff going on.  This one ended up being a better purchase than I had hoped.  It is just as good as any of the other tunes I have heard.  The vocalists on this are outstanding.  I don't mind the type of music they play.  It's catchy and fun.  It's not a heavy metal band and the lyrics aren't particularly political, but it gets a few laughs out of me every time I try to play it.  A good song to listen to during the day while you're working.  Just about any type of music would do, but this is the one I would recommend to anyone.

Amazon review: This album is a good choice for a young boy who doesn't know any better.  I have listened to this album on my commute to work and it makes me happy.

This album is something I will always remember and keep as a reminder of the good times.

Amazon review: This album has a great chorus and lyrics.  I don't know if I would call this a metal album because the music is not "heavy."

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: The Beatles played a song on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 and it was recorded for the album that was then released in 1965 and then again in 1968.  I know a lot of people remember this song from that era, but I don't think I do.  This is one of the few Beatles songs that I like to listen to as a song, because I love the sound of the electric guitar and I love the backing of the whole Beatles backing vocalist that sings, "we've got one, we've got two, we've got three, we've got four."  It is a perfect song for singing along with the beat that makes it so catchy.  I love the song and I like the music.  I will listen to this song over and over and over again.  As far as the original version, I remember hearing it when I was around 13 years old, and it was one of the first things that made me feel like I was part of something.  I am a big Beatles fan and I am not a big fan of the Beatles original version, so I like this version as well.  If you are a Beatles fan, this is a great song.

Amazon review: The song is about love.  It is about how a couple can be so full of love and life, and yet they can also be apart.  They stay forever together, but they are always apart.  It's about being so in love with someone that you do not realize that they may not be right for you.  It's about loving someone, but not being sure that it's the right person or maybe because they don't work out.  The song could be about any of us, but I think it is about the people that are in your life who are the most important to you.  This song is about the two people that we love that we don't know if we want to be with forever.  They are like the stars and we are the moon.  They are always out there, but we cannot see them.  We can only see the stars.  We can only see the moon.  We cannot see the sun.  We only have a short life time.  We are finite.  We are mortal.  We have a finite amount of time.  We are never going to get away from this life.  We are always going to be together, but we are never going to be together forever.  This is a song that speaks to a lot of people.  It's a song that I think speaks to a lot of people.  I think it is the truth.  I think it is the truth.  We can only ever be with the people who we love.  We can only stay together.  It is all we can do.  We can't go out and try on this world.  We can only stay together.  I think that is the truth.  I think that is the truth.  I think it is the truth.  This song shows us what the truth is.  The song shows us what we can do.  This song shows us what we can do.  This song shows us what it is all about.  We are finite and we all have a finite amount of time.  We are immortal.

Amazon review: I know I am in the minority, but I really like this song.  I like it when the music changes or the vocals change, but I like the song when it stays the same.  The song is a fun song for dancing to.  It's not a party song.  It's a song that is really good for the whole family to sing.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song has had an interesting history.  I first heard the song in the 1970s, and I believe it was part of the soundtrack for the film "Love Story".  The movie was about a couple who had a very strong relationship.  The song is about how they fought through their relationship and how they learned to love one another.  The movie was a big hit and the song became a big hit.  Michael and I watched the movie together, and we were in the movie theater and I remember the song playing

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

If you are looking for just a soundtrack that's very similar to the music of the film Titanic, then I suggest you check this album out, it is very hard to find.

I didn't find the film until about a year or so after it was released, and I was like, "man, this is a cool concept.  It should be cool."  Then, I heard the song.  My friend, who I listen to music with, told me it was the best song he had ever heard.  I was blown away.  I think I listened to it about four or five times.  And then, I went home and listened to it more.  And then, I was like, "Hey, I can't find the song on YouTube yet, but I'm going to listen to it at least 50 more times."  I was listening to it on shuffle, and I was like, "I want to know what happens to Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Rose.  I want to know what happens to her."  I found the song and then I was like, "I have to listen to this every day for the rest of my life.  I have to be in a room with a TV tuned to this show."  And then, I kept listening.  I was listening to this song every day for the rest of my life.

Now, you know the story.  I love the movie, obviously.  I love everything about it, but I don't know if I'd call it a bad movie.  It's not like the movie is terrible as far as I'm concerned.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.  I think the movie has really good music in it.  But, it needs more songs.  It's a very good movie, but I feel like it's missing songs that would have probably made it a great movie.  But, I think that's down to the director, Cameron

Amazon review: I wanted to order more than 3 cd's. When I selected them, I got a message that they were out of stock. I waited a couple of hours and called amazon. They told me they were in stock and could send me more. I did what they said and ordered them. They were all out of stock by the time I got them home. I called them, and they said they were in stock. When I got them home, I called my bank and found out that there were 3 cd's that I bought for $17.00, and they were all out of stock. I called amazon.com to find out why they were out of stock, and they said that they were in stock and I just didn't get the emails. They did tell me that they would refund me, but I should call them and let them know why I ordered the cd's and they would refund me. I called them, and the lady that answered the phone told me to call back in a couple of hours. I did, and they said that the lady that answered the phone said that they could not take a credit. I asked her why, and she said that it was because they said they were out of stock. I asked her to call me back, and she said that

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: This song is so beautiful I'm not even sure I can explain why I like it. It's like an angel's soothing voice, a voice that makes sense, like it's a girl singing to an angel, or like it's a soul singing to a spirit. It's so beautiful I'm not even sure I can explain why I like it, except it's like heaven and I'm not sure I'm ready for heaven yet.
