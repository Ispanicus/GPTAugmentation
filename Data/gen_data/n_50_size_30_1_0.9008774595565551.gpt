Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: As a jazz fan, I have to say that the music is very good, especially on the last CD (I have only one CD in my collection: The Last Dance).  The musicians are also very good, and very professional. I've been to several shows in the last year and I really have to praise the "New Orleans" band.  
I have to mention the "Prelude" CD.  This was my first time hearing it, and I'm glad that I did.  I got to see the performance (The New Orleans Band, The Original Mardi Gras Band, and the New Orleans Jazz Band) and I was amazed by the band.  The musicians did a really good job with the music.  The CD is also great, and I really recommend it to all jazz lovers.

Amazon review: I've had this CD for over a year and I have always been blown away by it.  
The band that plays it is a very talented group of musicians.  The music, the sound, they all sound very professional.  The musicians are very well-trained in their instrument, and they all play very well together.  They play in a very professional manner, and the arrangements are excellent.  The only thing I didn't like was that the CD was a little too lengthy, but that's more of a personal preference.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums I've had the pleasure of listening to in a long time.  I really like this CD.  It's a very long and very powerful album.  The music is so diverse and I love it.  I wish I could give it more than five stars.  I have to say though that I listened to this album twice, the first time was when I was in a bad mood and had to listen to something to feel better.  The second time I listened to it I was in a good mood (not sure why this happened) and the music was so moving and very powerful that I didn't want to stop listening to it.  One of the best musical albums I've had the pleasure of listening to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A collection of songs from around the world,  some of which are quite old (e.g. "Prelude"), some of which are quite modern (e.g. "The River").  Most of the songs are in a very traditional style, but they are all very good.  I really have to give this album five stars.  The musicians are fantastic.  I really like them all, and I think they are quite good.  I can't believe that so many people have never heard of them.  I don't think they are very well-known in the US, and I haven't been able to find the album on the radio or anything.  I love this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Some of the songs are very good, and some of them are very bad (e.g. "The River").  I found it very difficult to listen to (I am a professional musician and all my life I have played the piano and guitar), but the overall structure of the songs is very good.  The songs are very well-performed.  The musicians are all very good, and I have to say they play well together.  The musicians are very professional, and I would recommend this CD to all fans of this kind of music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this CD because of the name of the band, and because I was not familiar with the artists that were featured.  I have to say that there is a lot of variety in the music.  I really enjoy the style of the music.  Sometimes it's very nice, other times it's very boring.  I'm going to miss the songs I've heard on this album, but I still enjoy it for what it is.  I would have to say that I enjoyed this CD a lot, and I would give it four stars.  It's just a collection of songs, but it's a very good one.

Amazon review: I like the song.  The chorus is very catchy and the song is well played.  But even when I listened to the music video, I didn't like it because it didn't have a good message.  It's like the song was created to be a message for the viewer.  Instead of going after the person who is not ready, or who doesn't know how to live, the song creates a very negative impression on the listener.  It's like a message that's meant to be heard by everyone except for the person who is going to experience it.  It would have been better if the message was more positive.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I've been searching for a new CD to add to my Amazon cloud collection for several months.  I think this one is a keeper.  It is fun and easy to listen to.  The only thing that I didn't like was the song "I'm In Heaven".  I liked it for the first few versions I heard, but as I listened to it again, I just didn't like it as much.  I was sad when I heard that it was out of print.  I know the other songs in the cd are good, and I'm sure there must be a lot of good songs on there, but I was ready to move on to something else.  I love how the song "I'm In Heaven" is being performed live by Mr. Ray Benson.  He is a wonderful singer.  This guy was born to sing.  He was born to sing this song.  There should be more recordings like this.  I'll be looking for more Mr. Ray Benson CDs.  I'm a fan.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

This album was a big success at the time, but I don't know what happened to it after its initial release.  I do know that the only one song on the album I have ever liked is "I Don't Look For You" and that's it.  If you are a fan of Danzig, you'll like this album, but it is hard to say if you will like this album or not.  It's just that good.  I am not a fan of this album, but it would be wrong to say that I hate this album.  I just don't like it.  It's really good, but I don't know if I will ever buy this album.

I have heard that this album is different from the other ones, but if I am not mistaken, I think this is the same album I have been listening too for the last six or seven years.  The only song I really like on this album is "I Don't Look For You" and that's it.

Amazon review: This is not a one CD CD.  For those of you that bought this, I hope you are happy.  There is an alternate title.  I did order the CD and it arrived in a box that was too big for the CD case.  The CD case is a bit too big for my CD player.  I tried to use it as a coaster, but the CD player would not read the CD.  So, when I got home and listened to the CD, I was disappointed to find that none of the songs were on it.  So, I opened it up and found that it had been scratched by the CD player.  I asked the buyer if this was the actual CD, but the buyer is also not the one that made the CD.  I hope this isn't a big problem, but I have to say that it sounds like it.  It does not sound like this CD was made with good quality materials.  So, this is not the accapella CD.  I was hoping it was the one that was the actual Accapella CD so I would have a CD of the Accapella CD.

Amazon review: Accapella CD #1.  I have listened to the songs and the only song that I can remember is "This is not the Accapella".

I have listened to the songs and I can not remember them at all.  This is not the Accapella CD so I was hoping that it was and now I have to find out what the Accapella CD is.  I have no idea what I have just purchased so far.  I hope to figure out what I have purchased.

Amazon review: I have to say that the Beatles are better than any of the "great" singers of the past, they are the best pop band of all time.  The Beatles have the best songs, but their music is also the best.  They are far ahead of all the other pop artists.  They have the best harmonies, the best tunes, and the most amazing voices, the best musicians, the best guitar players, the best bass players, the best drummers, the best keyboard players, the best sax players, the best trumpet players, the best trombonists, and so on, and so on.  In fact, the Beatles are the best pop band of all time.  And they are also the best of the "great" singers.  So, I'm sorry, but their music is better than anything else, even the best singers.  And I would like to add that The Beatles were also the best pop band of the '60's, '70's, and '80's.  They were one of the few bands that did not change their style or sound for any of the major record companies.  The Beatles made just one album, they never made many albums, they made just one single, they never made many singles, they made just one album that sold over 100 million copies every time it was released, and it never did any major tours.  They never changed the style or sound of their music.

I don't know if you've ever heard of the band "Jagged Edge"?  I do not like them.  I have a couple of songs on their album "Love Song" that just suck.  Their song "I Need a Little Time" is the worst one on it.  They used to have a very cool song called "Goodbye" which is the best song on the album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:
This album is one of the most overrated albums I have ever heard.  I think this band is overrated.  I hate all their songs.  The album is full of filler and filler.  The first song is not even worth listening to.  The last song is a waste of your money.  This band is a joke!

Amazon review: Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted.  A waste of money!  Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted.  Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted, waste.  They don't deserve to play in this country anymore.  This is the second time I have seen them play here and they're terrible.  This is the second time I have seen them play in this country and they're terrible.  They look like they are in their fifties.  They act like they are in their twenties.  I saw them play for the first time at a show in Philly and didn't enjoy it.  The next time I saw them I was lucky to see them play a few songs at a show here in Miami.  They sounded great and their music was great.  They were at their best at their last show in Philly, but this time, the band played awful and sucked.  I would not recommend this band unless you are a hardcore hip hop fan.  This band has no real talent.  They don't have that special something that makes them great in my opinion.  I have a pretty good ear for hearing good music, but this band was horrible.  The only good thing about this show is that it was the last one I saw during this tour.  I had to listen to the rest of the shows.  This band is a total waste of time.

Amazon review:
I was bored with this album but the band still sounded tight.  I have to say that I like the first song on the album, the last song is great but I am tired of all the filler.  The band still has some talent, but for a band that I liked I give them a 7.0.  I think I would not like to see them again because they are mediocre at best.  I think they might be a band that would play their best at the start of every show.  I would not recommend this band to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:
I think this band is great for the first song, then they play a terrible song for the second song, then they play a terrible song for the third song, then they play a terrible song for the fourth song, then they play a terrible song for the fifth song, then they play a terrible song for the last song, and then they say goodbye to the audience and leave.  I think this band is one of the most overrated bands in all of hip hop music right now and I think they should just not play in the USA anymore.  The first song is pretty good.  The last song is good but the rest are awful and I wouldn't recommend this band to anyone.

What can I say, this is one of the best albums ever and I don't think it gets much better than the original release. I listen to it every night before I go to bed. It is an emotional, heart opening experience and I listen to it over and over and over again. Every time I hear it I think to myself, 'I love you'. This album is the best thing that has happened to me in the past couple of years. I love the way it is put together and how it portrays a very human feeling of love for someone you cherish and adore.

This is one of those albums that you listen to when you are in a very emotional state and I feel that's probably why it is so good. This album is an excellent album for anyone who is in love or heartbroken. This album will make you think about the person you love, and how much he/she means to you.

The sound quality is so bad, not even the vocals come through. The vocals are so weak it is almost impossible to figure out what someone is saying. At the same time, I can't see the vocals at all. The background music is terrible. It sounds like a cheap recording that someone put together using a CD recorder that makes a bunch of cheap sounds.

I've been listening to the album for a few months now, and I'm completely in love. I have bought it several times and the quality has not changed. I'm glad I bought the original, because this recording is not even close. I will never buy another recording from this company and I will never buy them again.

I am so glad I never listened to this disc because it is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. The only good thing about this is the sound quality. It is very poor, but it has a lot of good tracks. This is by far the worst album I have ever bought, and I am glad I did not listen to it.

It sounds like you have a poor CD player! The vocals are very weak and they are not even audible. The background music is horrible as well. This album is one of the most terrible I have ever heard. I would not recommend it.

I am so glad I never listened to this disc because there is nothing good about it. The only good thing about it is the quality of the recording. It sounds like a CD recording. The vocals are very weak, and not even audible. The background music is horrible and sounds like a cheap recording that someone put together using a CD recorder that has made a bunch of cheap sounds.

I've been listening to the CD for about a month now. I like the sound quality better than the actual singing. I am not a fan of this type of music, but I like it better than some of the other music I have. I don't understand why people like this music so much. It is the worst album I have ever had the displeasure to listen to.

The quality of the recording is poor. The vocals are not even audible on the CD. The background music is horrible. The music is almost completely inaudible. It is not a very good album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: My husband and I both love opera. He loves it more than I do, and I can listen to it all day long and not get bored. But I think this is one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard. I don't know how to explain it except to say that it's a very strong voice, with good range and power, and it doesn't sound like anyone else's voice. Lin Manuel Miranda's voice is not his own. It is his baby. When he sings, Lin Manuel Miranda is singing the music. When he sings this music, he has nothing else in his head. It is as if he is speaking directly to the music and is letting the music speak to him. I believe that this is one of the most moving pieces of music I have ever heard. It is so very special. I can't believe I am not the only person who has heard this album. I wish more people knew about it. I bought it to take to my husband and I thought he would love it. Instead, he was so disappointed and has not listened to it since. I tried to buy it again, but the guy I bought it from told me it was already sold out. I tried to find it on the internet, but couldn't find it. I don't know why it is no longer available. At least I didn't buy it to sell.

I am not sure why people like this song, but I can't stand it.  It is so slow that it is difficult to even hum the tune.  I can't understand why people are still on this song.  It is a waste of time to listen to it.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in this band.  They have not been able to grow beyond the first song, which is really pathetic.  They are so young and have yet to make any true musical statements that have any substance to them,  In fact, the songs are like they are having a "sing off" contest to see who can sing their most stupid,  I can't wait for them to get back on their feet so they can get some talent behind them.  They are about as talented as a mime.   I am also disgusted that the band's name is a reference to a band from the '70's.  I thought it was a reference to a band that sounded like a cross between the Bee Gees and the B-52's.

Amazon review:  I have found a few albums in my life that I liked.  They were not in my price range, but I enjoyed them.  I have been looking for a few "new" albums to buy for a while now.  I am looking for something new and original.  I have heard a few other new songs that I really like.  I just don't like the music that I have been hearing on the radio lately.  I am not looking for something that is going to be a hit.  I am looking for something that is going to make me think and feel.  I am not looking for something that will bring out the anger and frustration, I am looking for a new feeling.  I am looking for something new.  This is not it.

Amazon review:  I will start with "I Was Wrong", an album of all of the songs that I have ever heard on the radio.  I have been listening to music on the radio since I could pick up the radio.  I have heard many songs that I liked and many songs that I didn't like.  This disc is great because it has songs that I liked and songs that I didn't like.  I like the way the songs are arranged and the sounds of the voices.  I love the sound of the voices and the harmonies that are used.  I love to hear the harmonies that are used and I like to hear the arrangement of the songs.     I found it odd that in the liner notes that the two songs that were performed at the end of the disc were "What Do You Mean" and "That Old Man", but I like both the songs.  I think that the two songs are different and I don't see why they should not have been performed at the end of the disc.  I like the song that was performed at the end of the disc, "I Was Wrong".  I think that the album is a good listen.  I like the different songs that are included.  I think that the songs could have been played in a different order.  I like the songs that are included.  I think that some of the songs that are included are better than the songs that are included, but I still like the songs that are included.  I think that the songs that are included are a good listen.  I like the harmonies.  I like the arrangements.  I like the sound of the voices.  I like the harmonies.  I like the arrangement.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I bought this for my mom, since she loves opera.  I listened to this on my car stereo.  I drove to work listening to it.  It was a good day.  I like the way that we listen to The Beatles!  I'm not really a Beatles fan, but they're the best.  I'm not a Beatles fan, but I like their music.  I've always loved classical music.  I think I was probably born with a Beatles obsession.  The songs on the cd are wonderful, and I would love to hear some of their real instruments played again.  I used to play the piano, but I've been playing the guitar for a while.  I played in a jazz trio for over 25 years.  Now I play in a jazz trio in my spare time, and I love it.  One of the most important things to me is that all of us have to make up our own minds as to what we like and what we don't like.  I don't know how long it will take for me to write a review of their CD, but I'll keep you posted.

Amazon review: Here's one of those CDs that you can tell is a real album when you hear the cover song.  It's my favorite "classical" album of the year so far.  I've been an opera fan since the age of 5, and it's been a lifelong passion.  I've been listening to opera since I was a young boy and have been buying "classical" albums ever since.  I have a "classical" collection of over 200 CDs and I've had a few that had my favorite songs on them.  This album is definitely one of the best so far this year and I love it.  I've been an avid fan since I was a teenager.  I grew up with the classics and loved them but then I got into the popular music of the 60's and the 70's.  I've had numerous records by The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Rolling Stones and The Who as well as many others.  I like everything, classical, rap, rock, R & B, pop, punk, jazz, country, etc.  I don't care what it is.  I like all types.  I like "classical" artists, too.  Most of all I love opera, but I still have a lot of love for rock and roll.  This CD is one of my favorites, and if you like opera you'll love it.
