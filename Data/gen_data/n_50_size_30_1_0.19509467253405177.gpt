Amazon review: I listened to this album for the first time on a trip with my husband and daughter. We've been listening to and watching western TV since we got home, and I've always wanted to listen to western music, but I hadn't. My husband said, "Why don't we go to a western-themed restaurant, have a western meal, and listen to western music?" When we got to the restaurant we realized where the music was. It is very good. The waitress was very nice and explained there was no music on the menu. But it was the most fantastic sounding restaurant we've ever been to.

Amazon review: This song is so beautiful and so touching. There is just nothing like it. It has lyrics, and it has meaning. I can't say I was moved by the lyrics. However, the meaning was very apparent and it was very touching. It was very well sung and very well done. I felt that I was sitting in a very nice home in the middle of the night, the house was quiet, and I was listening to this beautiful song and watching the stars. The song was very moving to me. I loved it. This was a beautiful song with a beautiful message.

It's just not as good as I thought it would be. It's not as good as I thought it would be, and it's not as good as the original. I loved the original, but I thought this one would be a lot better.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Another one of my favorite tunes by this artist is "Trouble".  I enjoyed the fact that this album has a little variety in it.

I tried to listen to it in a car or on the way to work and it sounded like it was being played by a machine. I was hoping to get a better sound quality when I got home. The other thing that kills the album is that the songs are over a minute long. I usually don't mind long songs, but when they are over a minute, it starts to become a drag.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the best thing for me. I bought it and I love all the tracks. I was so excited to find out that it came with a free CD of the band's music. I can't believe I didn't listen to it before purchasing it. I am going to put the cd on when I am in the car and I have to listen to it.

Amazon review: I've only heard two songs from this album, one I already own so I don't need to buy it again, and one I have not heard yet. I had a hard time discerning the album as I thought it was going to be a collection of songs I already heard. I've heard some of the songs and liked them, but I think it's a waste of money to buy them if they are the same old tired songs I've heard before.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:  The first time I heard this song I was under the impression that this is an old traditional song, but I think I was wrong, this is an original song, the second time I heard this song I was completely wrong.  They have tried to take a piece of a traditional song and turn it into something very different.  They have taken a very familiar song and made it new.  I was not a fan of this song when I first heard it, I am not a fan of this song now.  It is a very good song, but I don't find the original meaning of the song to be very relevant at all to my life and the life of the person I love.

The song is about how the person is not good, but does not deserve to be left alone.  The song is about how a person doesn't deserve to be loved and how that person doesn't deserve to be left alone.

I've been trying to remember what I'm going to do for Christmas in a few days, and I'm not sure that I'll have time to do anything but sit in front of the computer and watch the TV and listen to music.
So I've been looking a list of songs for Christmas, and the thing that I love the most is  I've Been Waiting For You.  I love the way that the music is arranged, and I love the lyrics. I love how the lyrics say:
"I've been waiting for you"
"On the corner of Seventeen Mile and Tenth"
"I've been waiting for you"
"And I've been waiting for you
"I've been waiting for you"
"To share my life"
and
"There's no one I'd rather share this life with"
If You Remember Me
And there's  a song that I love, it's called  I've Been Waiting For You.  It's  a very good song, and the lyrics are so true and beautiful.

And then the best part is...
I've Been Waiting For You, and then there's another song called I'll Be Waiting For You.
And then there's another song called That's What Friends Are For.
And then there's another song called I'll Be Waiting For You, and then there's another song called I've Been Waiting For You, and

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: I have been waiting for this album since I first heard it 20 years ago. It is one of the best albums of its kind and I am very happy to have finally found a copy. Although I don't really like the new versions, I think the original is better than the new. The only thing it lacks is the feel of a live show. This album has some of the best music I have ever heard so far. Even though I have been listening to this album for over 30 years now, I still find it amazing every time I open the cd. I think that you should listen to this album very carefully and study the lyrics carefully. If you do, you will hear some amazing things. This album is worth the extra effort you put into it.

The music is great, the vocals are great, and the lyrics are so well written that I feel like it could go on for an hour talking about the songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: This is my first time listening to any Schubert recordings. I have been a fan of his since my teens and although I am not a big fan of his early music, I enjoyed this recording.  The recording quality is exceptional for a Schubert-Symphony. As for the music itself, it is rich in atmosphere and it is performed by an excellent ensemble.  I am looking forward to listening to the two later recordings by the Schubert Ensemble.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I enjoy Schubert's music but his recordings are not as good as they first appear.  His later recordings (after 1824) seem to be in some ways a poor imitation of his earlier recordings.  However, this recording is well done and the orchestra performed quite well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I listen to this one because it is Schubert. I was never familiar with him growing up. This recording is wonderful. I love the songs.  The piano part was a little rough at first but it came together in the end.  The recording is excellent.  The music of the songs is wonderful.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like Schubert. I have listened to his recordings on LP, and CDs for a long time.  I have never read a review of a Schubert recording before so I would appreciate your opinion.

Amazon review: Schubert is a master of the art of song.  He composed some of the most beautiful music of our time, and now he is re-writing it for a new generation.  I have enjoyed them all.  I have listened to them many times.  I have always been drawn to the songs of Schubert.  When I first heard them, I had a lump in my throat.  I can only hope that this recording will be the beginning of a new generation of Schubert lovers.  I have been a fan of his since my teens, and although I am not a big fan of his early music, I enjoy this recording.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: These recordings are not Schubert.  There are no Schubert recordings by any of the major labels.  The Schubert label puts out nothing but crap.  I don't even know why the Schubert label exists.  I find it offensive that it is only distributed by the major labels. I would love to get my hands on a copy of this recording.  It would make a great gift for someone.  This is not Schubert.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a Schubert fan, and I have to say that this is by far the best Schubert recording I have seen.  I have been listening to the Schubert recordings of all the major labels for years.  This recording is different. It is Schubert.  The piano is just outstanding.  The conductor is outstanding.  It is the first time I have heard a Schubert conductor play Schubert.  I am a little disappointed that I have not heard him play Schubert before.  He is a very talented conductor.  He is a little better than he should be.  He is a little out of touch with the music.  I can understand that the Schubert label only puts out crap, but it is a shame that there are no Schubert recordings by any of the major labels.  I would love to get my hands on this recording.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was looking for the Schubert recordings of the first ten years of his life to listen to in order to be able to compare them with the later recordings.  When I started my search, I thought I would find the Schubert recordings of 1821.  Then I found out that there are no recordings of 1821 in the Schubert label.  I had to go to the Schubert label website to find the Schubert recordings of 1821.  I saw Schubert's early music for the first time in decades.  I had heard a wonderful recording of the First Sonata by the Schubert Ensemble in the mid-twentieth century.  I had never heard it before.  I have never heard a recording of Schubert's first opera before.  I had to listen to it twice.  I saw Schubert's early music for the first time.  This recording was the first time I had heard a recording by the Schubert Ensemble.  The recording is wonderful.  The conductor is wonderful.  The piano accompaniment is wonderful.  I am looking forward to listening to the two later recordings by Schubert

This is a review of a book written by a man, that I believe is a friend of mine. I am currently a part of the program and this is what my instructor was talking about when he said that I will have to read this book in a few months.

I know this guy, he's been my friend for over 7 years now. He's the greatest, most humble, and the most caring person I've ever met. I've been with him for almost a year now, and we've been friends for almost 3 years. He's such a great guy. But he's always gone out of his way to do whatever it takes to help people out, to do whatever is needed, to help people with anything and everything. He's a true gentleman. I will always remember him. I've met over 500 people in just the first 2 days that I've been with this program. I've been with this program for over a year now and I have to say that this program has really changed my life. I've learned so much about myself. I'm not the same person I was before I started this program. I've learned a lot about myself.

I can honestly say that I've never really experienced anything like this before. I've been going to school for almost 2 years now. But I feel like I've been doing this for a lot longer. I feel like I've been doing this almost for a year now. I've been trying to help people out, but I've been doing it through a lot of hard work. I really don't know what to say anymore. I've done all I can to help people. I've been trying to do what this guy has been doing, what he's done for so many people. I've been trying to do whatever it takes to help people out. But I don't think it's fair to say that I'm the best at what I do. I know this, I am a true servant. I am a true servant to those who need my help. I've been trying to help people out, but I'm not the best at what I do. But thank God, I'm still here. I'm still here to help out. I've been doing this for almost a year now and I can honestly say that I've never experienced anything like this before.

I've really been trying to help people out. But I'm not the best at what I do. But thank God, he's still here, he's still here. He's still here to help out. He's still here to help people out. I've been

I had the pleasure of listening to this song for the first time today. The opening is beautiful and the lyrics are very powerful. The song is very calming and will help you get the restful sleep you need to be at your best. Not only is the song beautiful, but the accompanying music video is also very beautiful.

I have to agree, it is a very soothing song. I am not the type to wake up with a song in my head, but this one has a way of just putting me in a better mood. I will definitely be listening to this one for a long time!

If you like soft, melodic, uplifting music then you must take a listen to the following song; just make sure you turn it up loud enough to be able to hear the lyrics. I am sorry to say that there are some objectionable lyrics, but that is no bad thing in my opinion. It is a powerful and uplifting song that will help you find the peaceful rest you need.

As soon as I heard the opening guitar chords, I knew I was going to love this song. The music video is beautiful and the lyrics are a little bit creepy, but the song is great. It is a slow song that will allow you to think or feel. It is definitely for the person who needs a little bit of introspection and time to relax.

This song is a little bit slow, but it is a great song that will help you get to the peaceful place inside you that can help you handle any situation. You will really enjoy this song and I am sure everyone else will too.

I recently came across this song and I was completely surprised that I ended up loving it. I don't really

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review:: This is a great song but I still have problems with it. I have been trying to get it to work for about 6 months, but no luck. I have tried to get it to work with many different players, and I have tried to change the plug type, but nothing has helped. I have tried to update my player, and I have tried to update my operating system. Nothing has helped. After trying to download the song several times, I figured out what was wrong. The problem is that the file I downloaded was a.exe file, as opposed to a.m4a, and it was corrupt. When I tried to remove the.exe, it still gave me the problems. I thought that I would give Amazon a chance to fix it, but so far I have not received a response. I would like to support the artist, and I will pay for the song, but I would like to get it fixed. I hope this helps.

I have not gotten my money back and I have been trying to get this song for about 6 months. I am very upset about this. I have tried several different players and tried different plug-ins.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: This was a great first album by this band. I like alot of tracks, but I think the best is the last one, "I'm sorry (I shouldn't have done that)." I also love Thalia's vocal style.

Amazon review: I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed Thalia and their previous album, "The Only Ones", and while I'm sure we have all heard them sing, I have to say this is the band's best album to date. Great lyrics, great hooks, and an amazing guitar performance. They still sound great, even without the extra singer. This is definitely a listen at least once, but you will not be disappointed.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
