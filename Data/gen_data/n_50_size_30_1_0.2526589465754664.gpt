Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

However I did not like the music played on this recording.  It was all very repetitive and monotonous.  It was not at all like hearing Mozart's music.  It made me think that the performers were doing very well, but the music they were playing was not at all Mozartian.  It was more like a "rock" album.  I would recommend this CD to others, but I would not recommend it to beginners.  I would recommend just listening to it and then listening to Mozart.  If you've never heard Mozart, don't even listen to this CD.  It's just not worth it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I am a young man who has recently lost his mother and is trying to cope with this situation. It seems that my mother was very overweight when she was alive and her weight was responsible for many of her health problems.  She had been a very generous and loving woman. She was not a fan of alcohol and smoking. There were many times when she would have a glass of wine for dinner and would smoke a cigarette. She was such a positive person that I think I would have gone out of my way to help her. I still have so much to learn about this whole situation.  I remember her birthday on the 27th. It was a very special day for her. We had a birthday party. It was very emotional for me. As a child, I loved Christmas.  I remember being so excited and happy the day after Christmas. I remember my mother's birthday on the 27th. I have not been to a birthday party since. This is a very difficult time for me. This is my life and I have to deal with it on my own.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Description: I really like this album. It's definitely different from her previous three albums.  Her voice is still great and she still writes good songs.  It just sounds like she's trying to push things in different directions and not being able to do it.  I like her new songs.  I think they are different from Title and the other songs, but they are good.  They are enjoyable.  I feel like she's not being creative enough.  It's a shame because I really liked this album.  I just wish she could do the same with "great" songs like she did with these songs.  I think she's more of a writer than an artist at this point.  I think she has a great voice.  I like her new songs.  They're different, but I like how they are different.  It's interesting to see how she's been able to change from three albums to this one.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: This is my first cd that I have bought.  I am a fan of the blues.  I think that I have purchased a cd before and I liked that one.  This one is different.  This one is bluesy and has melody.  This one is definitely a cd that I would buy.  I am very excited.

This is a Good Classic

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was a little hesitant about trying this CD, but it is so beautiful!  This cd is very well produced and I love how the songs were recorded.

Amazon review: This is great!  The first time I bought this CD was before I bought my first car, and I was disappointed with the CD I bought!

I highly recommend this CD.

Amazon review:  I've only listened to this CD once (I would have to re-listen to it a few times before I could rate it) but I really like it.  The music is great and the lyrics are inspiring.      The only reason I wouldn't recommend this album is because the songs are not written by John Mayer.

Amazon review: I bought this CD on impulse.  I have been listening to the album nonstop since.  This is a very well produced album.              This CD is a perfect example of how a band can make a song that will make you look back on it and smile.  That is an amazing gift.                The album is great.  I really am enjoying it and I have re-listened to it a few times.              I would recommend this CD to anyone.  I am glad I bought it.

Amazon review: I enjoyed this album a lot.  I love the song "All My Life" because it is a truly great song.              The lyrics are great and the music is great.              It reminds me of my childhood and the way I used to love listening to music.              What I like about this CD is that it is very easy to listen to.              No matter if it is very quiet and very loud, it sounds great.             I also love the song "Mona" because it really speaks to me and my life in some way.             This may not be the best CD that John Mayer has ever put out.              But you will not be disappointed.           You will  love it.

In other words, the album is very well done in a professional way.              If you have never heard John Mayer before, this is the album for you.              You will love this album.            I would recommend it to anyone.

I would suggest to anyone to listen to it.

Christmas Album Review

I have recently discovered a new band called The Holy Ghost Band. They have a great sound

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This album is alright. Not going to lie, it is good to go from a solid first album into a solid second one. I know a lot of people don't like the folk sound, but I have to say that this is not a folk album. It is more mid-western/cowboy country, and while I don't like that genre, this album is a lot of fun to listen to. The songs are all well-written and the musicianship is good. I really don't think this album is as good as the first one, but I enjoy the overall sound. The only thing that really put this album down for me was the song "The Spy Hunter's Safe Haven". I think there should have been more of a hook to the song, and I really think that it is just as good as it is because of the lyrics and the music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is my favorite Mumford album so far. It actually has so many songs that I love. I love their "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven" and "Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men".

Amazon review: Okay, I'm gonna start with the good things and then I'm gonna get to the bad things...
I love this song. It's a song that I actually really like. I love the song, I love the vocalist, and I love the production that you chose to do the song.
I don't normally write songs about love. I usually write songs about my life, but this song I think is pretty self-explanatory. I mean if you don't get what the song is about from the title of the song then it just shows that you haven't listened to the lyrics.
The first time I heard this song I actually fell in love with it. But not only did I fall in love with it, I fell in love with the song. I fell in love with the song because it had something that I didn't think any song could have. A message. A message that I thought no song could ever have. You know what I'm talking about. A message that the very first time I listened to the song I realized it was a message for me. A message that I needed to hear, and that I needed to hear now. And that's not the only thing that makes this song amazing. There are plenty more things that make this song amazing, but I really don't need to talk about them.
The song itself is amazing. I'm not going into the song in much detail because I think that the song is amazing, but I will say that the song is amazing. The tempo is off, the lyrics aren't as good as they could have been, and it starts off very slow and then gets kind of choppy. But the most amazing thing about the song is that it's about love. Yes, it's not a love song, but it is a love song. I mean the song starts off with pretty much the most cliché love song lyrics that I've ever heard. But I think that the fact that the song starts off with these types of lyrics is just part of the appeal of the song.
The first time I heard the song I fell in love with it because it was about love. Yes, it's an amazing love song, but it's also an amazing love song that happens to talk about love.
So the first thing I have to make clear is that I'm not a huge Taylor Swift fan. I like Taylor Swift. I love Taylor Swift. But the fact of the matter is that I hate her. I hate her songs. I hate everything about Taylor Swift. I'm not going to lie, I'm not a big fan. I never have been. I'll never be a big fan, and I'll never be a huge fan. Even if I was inclined to be a huge fan I would never be a huge fan because that would mean that I was a huge fan of a person who I hate. I'm not a fan of Taylor Swift because I love the music. I love the music because I like the music. I'm not a huge fan because I love the music. I'm not a fan of Taylor Swift because I love the music, and I'm not a huge fan because I love the music. I'm a fan of Taylor Swift because I like the music. I'm a fan of Taylor Swift because I like the person who makes the music. She is a good person who makes music, and I like the person who makes the music. I'm a fan of Taylor Swift because I think she's a good person. I think she has good morals, and I think she's a good person. I'm a fan of Taylor Swift because I like the person who made the music. I like her as a person.
I'm not going to be a fan of Taylor Swift for the reasons that I never have been a fan of Taylor Swift. But I am going to be a fan of Taylor Swift because I like the person who makes the music that she makes. She's a good person, and I like the person who makes the music that she makes. I think she's a good person, and I think you should listen to her music because she has good morals, and I think you should listen to her music because she has good lyrics. I think you should listen to her music because she makes good music, and I think you should listen to her music because she has good vocals.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I bought this album a month or 2 ago, and it was amazing.  The lyrics are very deep and meaningful and the music is very good quality.  The only song that doesn't really grab you is the intro, but that's because it's the first song on the album!

I don't know who is singing on this video.  I think it is the same guy who sings "The Wayward Wind" by Bob Dylan.  It is a very good song.  It describes a person who thinks that everything is easy and that everything is going to be okay.  They have no idea.  The song is very powerful.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I have a lot of friends who have had success with Meghan Trainor, but none of them are singers.  I've heard their singing, but never really had a good idea of what they did.  I think I will buy this, but only if they sing it live.  I will wait for the live version of their song, otherwise I will just buy her other songs from iTunes or Amazon.  I really liked this album.

Amazon review: I've tried multiple times to sing, but find it difficult.  My voice is not good enough.  Yet, I want to teach myself to sing.  I really like the instructor who is great.  I think he has a great ability to explain things to people.  I will definitely buy this CD.

 Amazon review: Meghan Trainor sings this song so well. It is one of the songs that can really pull you in.

It's definitely a positive experience.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

They never contacted me to apologize or even to tell me that they had received my money back.  I was very rude to the representative.  I had heard a lot of bad reviews about this product...I was happy to see that the product was as good as they represented.

My favorite songs on this album are: "Get Down to It" and "Let Me Be the One" by the Temptations.  "I Wish" by the Temptations.  "You Make Me Feel...""Foolish Games" by the Temptations.  "You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)" by the Temptations.  And the song "The Star (The Greatest Game In Town)" by the Temptations.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
