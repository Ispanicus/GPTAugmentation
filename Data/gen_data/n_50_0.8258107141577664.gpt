Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Wow!  I absolutely love this album.  It's a good, solid album with some strong vocalists.  It's a bit more on the dark side than most of their other stuff, but it's still a solid listen.

Amazon review: I was a little reluctant at first, but I ended up buying two of them.  I love the vocals on this one, just as much as all the songs and artists that I choose to include on this blog.  I love how the songs blend together seamlessly, especially with the vocals.  I like it better than other albums I've listened to, but that is to be expected.  There is a lot of variety in this album, and each song is memorable, so I like to listen to it at least once a year.

Amazon review: This album is a good listen.  It's not an ideal album, but it's still enjoyable and worth the purchase.

Amazon review: It's so well written and produced, and these guys are great singers.  There's a band in there somewhere, but it's really hard to find because they take it more serious.  This album is the best of the best from this group.  It's a solid, solid album that is worth the buy.

Amazon review: I think this is one of the best records you can buy this year.  I have to say, these guys are talented and I think their record sales will continue to get better and better.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD just to get a feel for this singer, and to see what he sounded like.  He is a real talent.  The first song is a ballad, which we all know and love, but you'd think the song would be longer.  It's a simple ballad, which you would think would be longer.  But not this guy, and not this CD.  I couldn't believe it.  The song sounded so effortless that you can hear the emotion and he sounds so good, it's a shame he can't make it the full length.  His singing is a beautiful voice, and he has a great sense of pitch.  His voice reminded me of Paul Shaffer.  But, then again, he's the Paul Shaffer I've been hearing since I was about five.  So, I'm glad that I bought this CD.  I have one of every CD he's ever released.  But, this CD was a really nice surprise, and I won't be forgetting it.  I don't know why he's so bad, but I do know that if he makes albums like this his career will end.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The CD is well produced, with good production value, and the songs are all very fine.  There are so many CDs out out that I like that I don't bother buying them anymore, but I keep hearing about them, and they sound good so I go out and buy them.  This CD is a great example of something I like.  It's on the expensive side, but it is well done.  It comes with a couple of bonus tracks, and I've heard them a few times and they are great.  I just think the bonus tracks are a little filler and they don't necessarily add to the quality of the CD.  But, they are nice to have so I bought them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a terrific CD filled with excellent music.  Most of the songs are familiar to me.  I enjoy music from many different periods, eras, and genres, and this collection is no exception.  The best thing I can say about this CD is that it shows that there is always a lot of great music to be found--and a great deal of it is right here in  the U.S.  I really like it.  It seems to me there is a lot of great music out right now, and that much good music still needs to be written, but this CD shows that there is still a lot of music to be written.

Amazon review: This CD is an example of a terrific CD that was released in 1999, and is still available from Amazon.  It is  a collection of songs by a man who sings beautifully and with great power.  It is a great CD, and was released by Amazon.  It has just the right amount of filler.  I bought this CD just because it is available from Amazon.  I have had it for many years.  I would never use it, and I would never recommend it to anyone who I know would not like it.  It is one of the very best CDs I have ever bought, and I will never, never use this CD.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor.  I'm not sure what to say.  I know she has talent, she has a beautiful voice, she can write songs, and she was in a movie.  And I love the fact she has a song that is about her father. It is a song called "If You Ever Feel Like You're Falling In Love With Anyone".  The song is about a girl who is in love with her father.  But at the same time she is in love with someone else.  I like the concept of the song.  The song is in the key of C, and I believe it is a slow song.  It is beautiful.  I love the music, and I would like to hear more from Meghan Trainor.  I wish she would write more music that I enjoy.  I mean, I can't listen to the new material of any artist I like; I have to listen to the older material.  Because I don't like the new stuff on any artist I like.  I hate it. But I love the old stuff.  So, I have to get the old stuff to keep me happy.

Amazon review: I think we can all agree that Trey Songz is without a doubt one of the best rappers to ever grace hip-hop. As the first guy who has successfully blended hip-hop, R&B, and jazz, Trey Songz is the man. His first album, "The Way You Move," is a masterpiece of how to blend the three parts of the genre with one smooth flow. I was extremely impressed with the album's success and I was also extremely surprised. I didn't expect it to be as big as it was. I was hoping for more of a follow up album but he has proven me wrong. He is a world class rapper and I can't wait for his next album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've gone through a few of Trey Songz's albums (and I'm always looking for good rap albums) and I had to say that this his best so far. The tracks are very energetic and catchy and the overall quality of the music is amazing. I was shocked to find out that the first single off of his new album 'Blow' was number one on the Billboard charts. That is pretty amazing.

Amazon review: I am in love with Trey Songz, I could listen to this album over and over again.

There is no other guy like him and I just can't get enough.

Amazon review: Well, I've heard all of Trey Songz's albums and this one is the greatest so far. After listening to it, I'm really wondering how he made it into the top 10 on the Billboard album chart. And it's great!

I would definately recommend this album to everyone.

Amazon review: They're better than they sound.  I've listened to them many times over the years and they sound pretty good, but I think I would not like them.  I like the fact that they are  pretty long and have some really good moments.  I've also seen them live several times and I thought they were great.  I would not listen to them on vinyl.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Frank Sinatra (and I've played this song over and over and over).  I think this is fantastic.  Very well played and  great sound.  I love the  background vocals and the way they blend together.  I love the  saxophone and  trumpet.  I  love        the music and the way it is sung.  My only wish is that it was a bit longer.

Amazon review: In my opinion Hall and Oates are the best!  I have been listening to them for over thirty years and nothing  compares to their music.  I have listened to them in many different genres.  I think they are one of the most underrated bands, but I think they deserve more recognition.

Amazon review: I have been listening to Hall and Oates for years.  I have to say that I am very impressed.  This is the best song they have ever written.  And it is a very nice recording.  The song is very simple and the vocals are great.  I would give this album a 10 out of 10!

Amazon review: I have played this song for many years and still can't stop hearing that familiar "tappity-tap" on the acoustic guitar,  which is a feature of the song.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

I have been singing for ten years now, and have tried everything, and I've never been able to improve.  I've been searching for a way to improve my singing and with this CD I will be getting new songs and learning techniques.  I would say it is well worth the expense.  It has been a long wait for the songs and I am looking forward to learning them.  I wish I had discovered this earlier, because I can tell the songs I am learning will be really effective.  I've been singing all of my life, but have always been afraid to sing in front of anyone.  Now I have the opportunity to sing to the best of my abilities!

Amazon review: I love the lyrics but the music is really boring,  I was hoping for something new and different,  I'm not a fan of a lot of his music but I can't help but like this music and the lyrics.  I did buy it for the bonus song.  I only bought the song "Love Me Like You Do", I'd say the music is better but the lyrics are really really boring.  If I had money I'd buy this song and all the other bonus songs but I just decided to buy this song and "Love Me Like You Do".  I don't mean to disrespect the artist and the song but I just hope this song is different than the other one's.  I really like this song and the concept.  I'd say the music is better but not my favorite.  I don't like him to be more popular than he is.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: I love the musicality on this one.  It is more melodic than the rest of their albums.

Amazon review: Very listenable but I have several issues with this album.  The songs are very repetitive, with very little variety.  You can tell that the music production crew is not good.  You can tell that the songwriters don't have much insight into the lyrics or into the music.  And the musicians are not as good as the vocals.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The songs were nice but the lyrics were lame.  Songs like "Tú Y Yo" and "La Mujer Que Te Amaba" have nice lyrics but are boring.  "La Mujer Que Te Amaba" has a horrible bridge.  The song "Hasta El Día" has good lyrics but it has no melody.  The lyrics were boring and the only thing that made me like the album is the musicianship.

###  "Tú Y Yo" is one of the best songs on the album.  It is very personal and the vocals are outstanding.  I really liked "La Mujer Que Te Amaba", "Hasta El Día", "Jugando con la Diosa", "La Mujer", "Estar en la Silla", and "Cómo Es La Vida".

Amazon review: I am a little worried about the quality of the instruments, vocals, and arrangements.  The musical quality is great, but the instruments are very tinny and the vocals are awful.  I hope that there will be a better version of this album, because this one is a little overproduced.  The musical arrangements and arrangements of instruments are so poor.  The vocals are very bad and there is not much variation in the songs.  The songs are very repetitive and the lyrical content are boring, but I still think the album is worth hearing.

It makes it easier to understand her songs. She has a wonderful voice and is talented in her own right.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest album by Twiztid.  I thought that this album was going to have a lot of good stuff and I was pleasantly surprised.  The first 10 songs were all good.  Unfortunately about the middle of the album the group decided that they were going to put out another CD in a month.  This CD is not up to the standard that I expected.  It sounds like they are going through the same old same old.  Even during the choral works, the sound of the choir is very weak.  This is probably the worst Twiztid album released so far.  I had to listen to the album two or three times before I knew it was real.  Twiztid is nothing more than a bunch of rapping thugs who are trying to sound like they are having fun.  The songs on this album are repetitive and boring.  This is probably the worst Twiztid album released so early.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the second album that I have gotten on the internet and I am not disappointed.  The first album was a bit disappointing, but this one is a much better album.  The only thing that I don't like about this album is that it is a bit too long so I would suggest that you play the album in one sitting.  It would be best to listen to it while you are driving or on your lunch break.  Twiztid has a great voice and it is a pleasure to listen to.  The music is very catchy and the lyrics are very entertaining.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was looking forward to this album for a long time and I am not disappointed.  The first 10 songs on this album were good and very catchy, and the middle and last 10 songs are very good too.  The song "Candy" is especially nice and I like it very much.  The only drawback is that the songs just don't get enough airtime.  I just hope that they will make another album soon.

Amazon review: When I received this album the first thing that I thought about was how much I love this band.  The opening song is one of my favorites and I was very happy when I found out that this song is from the new album.  This album is great.  The first 10 songs were great and the middle and last 10 songs were good too.  The only problem I have with this CD is that it does not get enough airtime.  I hope that the next album will be better.

Amazon review: I am happy to say that I have finally gotten another CD by Twiztid.  The first 10 songs were great and the last 10 songs were very good too.  The one bad thing is that some of the songs were so long that they did not get enough airtime.  I hope that they will make another album soon.

Amazon review: After reading the review, I was not looking forward to this album at all. I was really surprised at how good it is.

The beginning of the album was a little slower than I am used to but I just have to get used to it.  If you guys like this band I would recommend that you buy the whole album.

Amazon review: I was looking forward to listening to this new album by Twiztid.

Amazon review: I think what amazon is trying to say is that these guys were not the greatest blues rockers. I guess in some ways they were better than the Beatles. But at a time when the Beatles were the greatest rock band in the world, did we really need a band that didn't sound like anybody else?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have always been curious as to why the composer chose this piece.  I have listened to it and while I can't say that I "love" it, or that I "favor" it, I have listened to it a few times and enjoyed it tremendously.  Now I wonder.  Anybody have any idea?  I don't know what it's about, but I am curious.  I have asked this with all composers I have ever encountered.  I understand that the piece could be about Jesus, or the Holy Ghost, or the Holy Spirit!  I just don't know.  I just don't know!  The piece is not about the "Holy" and the "Holy" does not mean "Divine."  I think it's about the "Holy" because it's in the title.  I have just been wondering, the way most people do.  The way that I have been reading the lyrics.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Each song is performed with the same four chords, over and over.
