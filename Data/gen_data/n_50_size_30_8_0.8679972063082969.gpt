Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Yes, I do listen to a lot of MP3 music.  I have had trouble when using CD players, because the audio would stop working when the CD player would run out of space.  I have had to plug directly into the radio or CD player.  I do use CD players, and have been very pleased with their performance.  I do like the sound of MP3 players.  The sound quality is much better, and I do find that I am able to listen to music for about half the time it takes to listen to a CD.  I have had an iPod for about 5 years, and have had it for about a year now.  I have to admit, I am not a big fan of the size of the thing, as it is too big for my pocket.  I do enjoy the music that I have on it, and I find it to be very nice to use, as I have grown to be somewhat of an audio music addict, and I can't turn that off.  I am very happy with my iPod.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have this one to give to someone else.  I noted that when this music is played by Smooth Jax...there just is not enough other instruments in the music...I have now learned to buy Smooth Jazz productions that contain a variety of music from other musicians...

Amazon review: I have to say that I love this music. But I also have to say that the vocals are sometimes a bit annoying.  If this was a smooth jazz recording I would have given it a 5..with the more mellow "Makin' Whoopee" and the slower "Cab Driver"...but the vocals are a bit annoying. The song "Cab Driver" is the only one that I have to give it a half a star.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Some of his best work.  This song is about a guy who was the only thing that stood between his mother and a jail cell.  He wanted to leave so he could go home and get a divorce and live a normal life.  He's a guy who was able to leave the drugs and alcohol.  We all can't.  But if we try, we can leave a normal life behind.  There's always that guy in the back of our mind.  "You Can't Turn Back" is a great song.  It's one of my favorites and one of my favorite Thalia songs.  I don't know why it's not on the album.  I think the songs are great but the album is good.  But I do know why it's not on the album.  It would be so good to have it on the album.  I want to hear more from Thalia.  I want to hear more from him.  I have no idea why they haven't put more on the album.  There are a few songs that are not on the album.  I do have a song that is on the album.  I think it's a song that deserves to be on the album.  I hope to see more from Thalia.  I hope to see more of him on the radio and in the movies.  I hope that he gets a chance to go on a concert tour.  I know he's good.  I know he's great.  I know he can do a lot more.  I know when he does a concert tour, he will be a legend of the blues.  He may not be the greatest singer but if he gets a chance to play, he can bring some great entertainment to the fans.  I know he can sing and play the blues.  I know he's a good guy.  I know he's a good artist.  I know he's a great guy.  I know he's a great singer.  I know he's a great artist.

I was excited when I got my copy of the album but as soon as I listened to it, I started to get really bored.  I had an interest in Thalia for a long time.  I've always thought that Thalia had a great voice.  I wanted to be like Thalia when I grew up.  I wanted to be the singer that she sings in her songs.  I wanted to be like her.  This album doesn't do that.  I feel like the songs are average.  They don't have the feel that Thalia does.  She has a better voice.  This album doesn't have a true feel to it.  I really don't like the songs on this album.  I really don't like them at all.  I don't know why they didn't put more songs on the album.  I don't know what the problem is.  I don't know why this album is only on the first one.  The songs on the first one aren't all that great.  I know they could have put more on the album.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The boys are just plain great!  There is nothing in the world like them.  They are awesome. I'm a fan.  I just wish the album was just a bit shorter.  My favorite track is the middle one, "Forgiveness".  I think it's a great message to take to the people and what people are going through with their lives.  They sing so well and the melody is very nice and moving.  Great job guys!

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: A very good album for fans of the genre.  The album does consist of a diverse array of styles ranging from dance to hip-hop, from rock to rap and everything in between and it's all really well done.

Amazon review: I don't know if I can say the same for this album after having listened to it more than once.  It is a great album but I don't know if I can say the same for it after having listened to it more than once.  I really love the first single, 'New York City', but I feel like the group should have stuck with the second single, 'I Hate Myself' for the remainder of the album, which is good because it's a great track.  I do have to say that 'I Hate Myself' is my favorite track on the album.  I love the beat and the chorus and everything about it.  I also love the second single, 'One Way Ticket', but I feel like the group should have stuck with the third single, 'P.E.A.C.K.' for the remainder of the album, which is a solid track.  I love the video, which is probably the weakest part of the album for me.  I really like "P.E.A.C.K." and the video.  There is a good vibe to the album which is really good.

A little over a year ago, I had a dream about my ex-husband. I was having a nightmare and he was in the room with me. His face was in my face and I could hear him breathing. I woke up and he was gone. I had to move on or else I would have been stuck in a nightmare forever. I ended up getting married again and he was the best thing to ever happen to me. He gave me my first baby girl that I lost to a horrible disease. I wanted to keep her and I am so grateful for that. I have been blessed with two more children. My daughter is now 5 and my son is 2. I am a single mom of three.

My name is Crystal. I am a single mom of three and a wife to my best friend. I am not perfect, but I am a good person. I love to laugh, but I also cry. I am a good person and I make mistakes along the way. I just have to keep going and working on myself.

My name's Kimmi. I am a 21 year

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I've been a fan of the song "I Want Your Love" for almost 20 years, but I've never been as taken with this new song as I was with this one.

Amazon review: His voice is good, but boring.  I am not a fan of his music.  I bought this because it was one of his songs, I wanted to have a copy.  When I tried to download I was told by the site I downloaded to look for the CD.  Instead I got the song "I Can't Hold On" from his previous cd, it's only about 5 minutes long.  I don't want to have to download it again, it was more than I wanted to spend on the CD. I have another copy of the song from his cd "I Can't Hold On" in my car, that CD was also cut off, and I am not sure if it is even on the CD yet.  I am going to listen to the entire cd in the car, and see if I can download it.  I don't want to pay for a song from someone else, but I want my money back, and I will not have to listen to his cd again.  I am not saying he is a bad artist, he is an artist, but like I said, I haven't bought his cd, yet.  I just don't like his music.

Eminem - The Slim Shady LP

by Anonymous

I was searching for a Eminem album to buy for my brother who is going through some personal problems and I saw this album and decided to buy it and listen to it. I purchased a few albums from the '80s and the last couple of years and I was hoping this was the one to break me up with the 80s!

The first thing I was going to say was "You know we love you, but we can't help but see how much of a faggot you are!" but...

I am not gay. I am just not a big fan of Eminem. I would like to say that the reason is because he is a big, old, fat fag but really it is because he is a big, old, fat fag.

The only things I like about this album are the song "No Love" (which is a great song) and the song "The Way I Am" (which is a great song).

The album is pretty good. I don't like the whole "This Ain't A Love Song" thing that some artists do. I hate when they do it.

This album is not perfect. But I would rate it 8.5 out of 10.

I would recommend this to a friend.

The Slim Shady LP is the best album Eminem has ever made. The way he lays it down on the album is just to pure poetry. It's like a masterpiece. The songs are great.

It's kind of hard to explain what this album is all about, but it's a good album.

by cbain

An excellent album from an excellent artist. If you're a fan of Eminem, you should have this album.

While the album is on the lighter side of Eminem, he still manages to create a masterpiece.

Many of the songs on this album are amazing. Not only is there a lot of good rap music, but the lyrics are amazing.

This album is a must have for any fan of Eminem.
