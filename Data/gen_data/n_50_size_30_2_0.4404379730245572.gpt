Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I don't care how you look at it,  this is one of the strongest albums in a very long time.  There is a lot of great songs to hear and it's hard to put this album down.  This is probably the best album to come out this year by the way.  I think it's really close to my favorite albums of all time.  The only downside I can say is that they don't have an album coming out this year.  I'm hoping they come out with one before the year is out though.  If you're looking for a very good album with excellent production, great lyrics, and a great message then get this album.  I would do it again in a heartbeat.

Amazon review: This album is a good band but too many bad songs.  The band started out great with "No More"  that still is a hot song now and this album is no different.  The song  "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" was one of the best songs on the album.  But then you have "I Wanna Know"  It's annoying how this song is on every album and they keep adding more bad songs.  The other songs on the album are good but the bad songs should be removed.

Amazon review: This album is a pretty good representation of the first two albums by this duo. The songs are well written, some with a pretty good melody and some with very basic songs that can be sung by non-musicians. The two songs on this CD that I like are the "I'm Not That Kind of Girl" and "I'm Not That Kind of Girl (Again)" and they are both pretty much the same song. The "I'm Not That Kind of Girl (Again)" is a good album, but I think this is a little too similar to the first album. It takes away from the original sound of the duo. The "I'm Not That Kind of Girl" is a good song, but I think it is a little too similar to the first album.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This song is a solid hip hop song with a lot to offer; it's not really all that unique.  The melody is catchy, the lyrics are good and I enjoyed the production.  Overall, I'll just listen to the music after I've listened to the lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this kind of music, but this song really didn't do it for me.  I didn't like the production, and I didn't like the vocals of the rapper.  I'm not sure if it's the same artist, but I'm going with "R.O.I."

Amazon review: I will admit to having heard nothing of this artist before.  I am a big fan of the rapper/producer, but this song was so bad that I couldn't even get past the first song.

Amazon review: I really liked the song, but I thought it had a lot of flaws.  The rap and production were good, but I don't think they were used correctly.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: This is an awesome album of music. Not only are the songs catchy and fun, but their performances are great as well. It's hard to choose a favorite of the 12 songs, but "You're so Beautiful" and "We're Gonna Move" are both worth a listen.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Another great album of great songs.  The first two songs I have heard are "Thing", and "You're So Beautiful".  The rest of the songs I haven't heard yet, but they are all catchy enough for me to want to listen to them again.  Also, it seems like every song has an incredible voice.  The only reason I would rate this lower is because of the fact that not all of the songs are available on CD.  The songs are: "All Out of Love", "Can't Take It With You", "I Like it Like That", "I Won't Stop", "I'm Gonna Be", "I'm Not Over You", "I Told You A Thousand Times", "I've Got You", "I've Got You", "It's Been So Long", "It's Not the End", "Look What You've Done", "Love Is a Battlefield", "More Than A Feeling", "On & On", and "Once in a Lifetime".  These songs are all great, and I would encourage anyone to listen to them.  I will have to listen to the rest of the songs, but I am glad that I have them on CD.  Also, I have not seen the movie "The Notebook" yet, but this album is a must have for me.  I love the way it is written and sung, and I love the energy and passion in the performances.  I can't wait for the film to come out.  The only bad thing about it is that it does not cover all of the songs.  However, in the end, I am glad that I listened to it, and I am glad I have it on CD.  I hope that everyone who hears it will enjoy it as much as I do.

Amazon review: This is the first album of the "Thalia" CD.  I really love the first two songs: "You're So Beautiful" and "You're So Beautiful".  It's also really interesting that they are almost all about real life with real people, and that they have been sung by real people.  I believe that I have heard this song before, but I can't remember where.  I really like that I heard it on the radio, and I really like when people who I like sing it.  It reminds me of being with my boyfriend.  I have no idea why, but I love the song.  It's one of the reasons I am a fan of this artist.  The songs "All Out of Love", "You're So Beautiful", "I'm Gonna Be", "I'm Not Over You" and "I've Got You" are all really great.  "I'm Gonna Be" really makes me laugh because of the way it is written.  "I'm Gonna Be" makes me laugh because of the way it is sung.  It is great to have this CD available, and I hope that everyone who hears it will enjoy it.  It's worth the purchase.  It's a really good album.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes this artist.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I love how the songs are written and sung.  I love that this album is different from others because the songs are written and sung by different people.  I really like "Don't Let Go" and "All Out of Love".  "All Out of Love" is a sad song that makes me feel better because it's about someone who is dying.  I really like "Don't Let Go" because it makes me feel like the person who is about to let go is actually thinking about the person who is about to let go and not about themselves.  This album is really great.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes this artist.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: I think this is a song that is really hard to listen to at times. I find it hard to listen to because it is so harsh. It does not change, but it becomes more and more annoying.  I can understand why it is called the "Giant Kill" but not enough to enjoy listening to it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the song the guy in the song says "I don't give a shit what you do, I'll kill you. I'll burn you up and spit you out and I'll make your bones ash." What is this song about? It is about someone who has a death wish and wants to kill someone or something. I know he says he doesn't give a shit, but he does and he doesn't care what is happening to him. When the guy dies, he is in a better place.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't really know too much about music, but I like the fact that this song is not a radio hit. At least not yet.

I like this song, but I would like to see the video with the band.

Amazon review: I think this is a very well written song, which is what keeps this song from being a radio hit.  The lyrics are very well written.

The singer has a very nice voice and voice quality.  He has a nice low-pitched voice.

Amazon review: I like this song a lot, but it is a little repetitive.  It does not really have any variation.  There is one part that is not as catchy as the rest of the song, but it is what makes this song better.  The singer has a very nice voice and voice quality.  The singer has a very good and nice vocal range.  He has a very nice way of singing and he has a very good way of singing.  Maybe it is the part where he yells, but he does it in a good way.  Overall, this is a very good song and I will continue to listen to it.

Amazon review: This song is actually not about the guy that sings it, but that is the song. I don't know what it is about or who is singing it, but it is very well written.

I wish that the song had a video, because it would show the singer as well.  I also wish that the song had a video, because I really liked the way the singer sang the lyrics.  This is a very good song.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first thing I hear is the music, or is that what I hear?  It's very upbeat, and has a lot of different elements.  I like the fact that it takes the listener on a musical journey through the world of jazz and beyond.  It's a good album, and I think it's a good album that doesn't want to be labeled as jazz or pop, but is instead music that you can listen to while you're doing other things.  I could listen to it while I'm trying to get work done, or I could listen to it as I am doing other things in life.  This CD is great for that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first song that I heard was the first one I heard in the CD.  I have to say that I liked it.  I thought it was a little different from the other songs on the CD.  But I thought the music was okay.  I don't like the next song.  But the song after that, I liked it.  I think the CD would have been more effective if it was a little longer.  I thought the overall sound of the CD was good.  It's good that she was releasing it as a CD.  I can understand why she chose to release it that way.

Amazon review: What is this, the Twilight Zone?  I can't stand singing so I have to find someone else to do it for me.  If this were the Twilight Zone then it would be called The Twilight Zone Singing Lessons with a Twist.  I'm not a fan of this CD.  I don't like that the singing is all in one voice, and the singing is not very good at all.  I'm really disappointed in Meghan Trainor because I like her song.  But after listening to this CD I didn't like it.  I thought it was fine, but I thought it was a little too boring.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you want a good mix of pop and jazz, then this is the album for you.  The two elements blended into one really worked well.  The songs on this CD are original and very well written.  Meghan Trainor has a voice that can be truly amazing.  She has a voice that people can't help but listen to.  This CD was perfect for me.  I listened to it in the car while I was on the road traveling to another city, because I had to listen to it while I was driving.  I thought I would never have any more of Meghan Trainor.  But she surprised me yet again with this CD.  It was a real surprise.  I liked the last song, but I didn't like the rest.  I think it was a little too quiet for my tastes.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that this is one of my favorite new songs of this year.  I really like the song titles.  I like the fact that it is a little more of an R&B style song.  It doesn't have the same edge that you would normally get from a pop song.  I really like the chorus.  I think the song is very good.  It's a really good song.  I think that it is a little too quiet though.  The other song that I like is the second song in the album.  The other song is a little more a ballad.  I don't like the song.  I think the song is not very good.  It's okay, but not great.  I don't think I would have liked this CD if it was longer.  I would have liked it a little more.  I would have liked it a lot more.  But I'm not the type of person that loves to get sick and have a cold.  I'm allergic to peanuts, so the song would have made me feel really sick.  So I'm not too excited about the song.  But the rest of the song is not bad.  I like the song.  I like the album.  I'm disappointed in the song though.  I think it's a little too quiet.  I don't like the song.  The album was good though.  I think it's a good album.  I'm going to buy it.  I like that I can take this CD with me on the road.  It's a good album.  I still like the song.  I don't like the song though.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure where to begin. It's not bad, just...not good.
I agree that the first song "Caught in a Trap" is a little too similar to "I'm Not Your Negro" from their debut album.  But the rest of the songs are a lot better, with "Crazier" being the best, and "T.A.L.E.S. (the other way)" being one of the best rap songs of all time.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the music of Twiztid.  Their music is not always easy to find these days, but when I do find it,  I'm there. I love the style they are making the most of, and they are really on fire right now.  When I first heard the new song "Caught in a Trap" I thought "Damn this dude is working".  But then the chorus came in and made me think "Ohhhh I'm sorry this dude is working!  I'm in the trap"!  This song is so good, the chorus and all of the songs on the CD are all different, but they all have a lot of good songs in them.

Amazon review: I've listened to a lot of Twiztid lately, and the only song that really stands out to me is the one on the CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Overall, this album would make a great summer album.

Amazon review: This is the new record from the "All Star" line up.  The most recent version of the All Star line up features B.o.B, Ludacris, and Ja Rule.  The album is a very good one.  It's got the old school type of music that we all grew up with.  The most current song is a good one, which is the title track "All Star" which is a very good song.  The song "Big Girls Don't Cry" is a good one as well.  Another song that I liked was called "What It Feels Like" which is a nice song about a girl talking to her ex-boyfriend who she's out with.  A song called "I'm a Man" is also very good.  The album ends with four songs in total.  The first is a song called "Just Like Me" and the next three are a song called "Let's Get It", a song called "The Other Side", and a song called "The Realest".  The song "The Realest" is the last song that is on the album.  The album is only about 14 songs long and all of the songs on the album are very good.  Overall, this is a nice collection of songs that will keep you hip hop and pop happy for a long time.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is good.  The majority of the songs are very good, but I've heard better.  I've heard this album before, but I can't remember the title or artist.

I can tell you that when you turn it up loud enough you hear it, but not that high of a volume that I can't hear it.  I wish I knew a better song to play.  I'll try to keep the volume down in the future.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
