Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is the third recording I've heard of Bach's Passions of the Heart.  I love these guys and I love the Bach.  I saw them in Richmond in 1998.  I had to get my hands on a copy.

Amazon review: This is my favorite album of the past 20 years.  I was very disappointed when I got this cd and saw that it was from a group that I had never heard of before.  I had no idea the cd was from either side.  I had a friend who was a huge fan of the group and he died in 1998.  I was very upset and I really wanted to find out what happened to him.  I was told by the owner of the cd that there was no way of knowing what happened to him.  I was shocked and confused.  The album was a good mix of hits and new material.  I was very surprised by this as well.  It was nice to have a good mix of the two sides.  It also has a couple that I don't know.  When I got this cd I was very surprised that it was from a group I was unfamiliar with.  I was very surprised that there was no way of knowing what really happened to my friend.  The cd is a nice mix of new and old material.

I was very surprised that I had a cd from a group that I thought I never heard of before.  I was very surprised that there was no way of knowing what happened to my friend.  The cd is great.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

If you are into classical you will appreciate it.  If you are into something else, you will enjoy it just as much.

Amazon review: First of all I have to say that I've never heard of this artist.  I've listened to her music several times.  I'm not a fan.  I'm not really sure what the lyrics mean.  I like some of the words better though.  I don't like her vocals or the music. I think they are too girly sometimes.  I just don't like her.  I have several other CDs of artists I listen to.  I don't like all of them unfortunately. But some I do like. I don't like all of the music from her CD.  I'm not a fan of her music.  I listened to her CD with out looking for it.  I just listened to it because I was in the mood for that type of music.  She can sing, but I don't like her music.  I don't want to listen to it.  I will probably buy this CD, but I just don't like her music.

I like it because of the lyric.  I think everyone can relate to that.  I like the music, but I don't like the song.  I'm not a fan of the lyrics.  I think the music is excellent.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Well the music is in the right key, and the lyrics are in the right key, but the music is just awful.  The instruments are just awful, the singing is just horrible, the lyrics are just horrible, the beat is just awful, and he has absolutely no passion for the lyrics, it's just a generic hip hop song, and it doesn't really make any sense.  So it just comes off as a generic hip hop song rather than a nice song.  I'm not saying that he is bad, I just think that it's just not a good song, and it doesn't really have any redeeming qualities.  The song is just a generic hip hop song, and it doesn't really have any redeeming qualities, it just sounds like the generic version of a hip hop song.  So if you want a generic hip hop song, that's what you get.  I would recommend that you just skip it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I just bought this a few months ago. I like it. The CD is not in my regular rotation, but I bought it because I liked the CD. I'd like to recommend it to others, but some of the questions you're asking are for later in the process. So, what you need to do is:

Go to your first question.
Pick the answer that is most accurate.
Ask your next question.

I'm not going to edit your question because you are right. You are right in that the answer is correct.
If you don't care that much, just answer the question, but I'll leave it at that.

You answered your first question correctly, which is the most accurate answer. Go to your next question.

How do you get to the store?

You can call the store. You can take bus, taxi, or walk. A walk is going to be faster, but a taxi is also going to be faster. You can ask the taxi driver what the fare is. It's $4.50.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is Schubert's best known opera, and his best known setting of the poem he wrote for it, "Die schöne Müllerin" (The beautiful maid).

It was first performed in Paris in 1827 and then in Berlin, with its first revival in 1845.

Amazon review: Schubert is the German composer and has been known for his great love of music. He wrote over 40 operas, and many other songs. He started composing at a very young age. He also wrote songs, and he played an instrument, the oboe. In 1824 he was married to a woman named Sophie, which became known as "the greatest love of his life". He wrote the opera "Die schöne Müllerin" (The beautiful maid) in 1827, which was first performed in 1845 when he was 75.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Advantages

Disadvantages

"Love" is one of the songs on this album that really gets the heart going.

I have always been a huge fan of Meghan Trainor. I love her voice, her ability to sing in different styles, and her songwriting. I was extremely excited when I heard this new album that Meghan was released by Columbia Records. The album is entitled "Wings", and it's about Meghan trying to find love in the world.

The album starts with the song "Love" which is one of my favourites on this album. I have always been a fan of Meghan because I think she is very talented at what she does. Her voice is very unique and she has one of the best voices in the industry. And I have to say, she is able to do so much with it.

This song really touches the heart and I can relate to the lyrics very well. The song is about trying to catch a man who has his eyes on another woman. The singer of this song is named Michael Hirst and he is a real life man and a real life man's man. He is in love with a very beautiful woman and he wants that woman to be the one he wants to spend his life with. But he is in love with someone else and the woman he loves is also in love with someone else.

The lyrics are very personal and I love that you can really connect with them because you can tell they are being sung by someone who is very real. The song "Love" has a very beautiful background of strings and a very cool piano. The singer makes you feel like you are in the song and you can feel the emotions
