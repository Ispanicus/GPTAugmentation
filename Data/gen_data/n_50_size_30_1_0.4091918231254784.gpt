Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

The lyrics were very good (I could have a better word for what they are called) and the album itself was quite good, so I still consider this a great purchase.

The packaging is not great in my opinion, and it's hard to find any CD case with any lyrics. If you are looking for a good hard rock album, it is not for you.

The CD is definitely worth it. I was surprised at how good it sound.

I would give it a 5/5, but I think the packaging is a bit better on the deluxe version, so that would bump it up to a 4/5.

I know that the album is a bit pricey, but the quality is good and I feel as though I got a good deal on the album.

I would like to thank the artist and the company for their service.

Hi, I like the album. The packaging on the Deluxe is great and the price is very reasonable. I am interested how you feel about the album. Have you listened to it?

I'm glad you liked the album, I'm glad it's a good one. I'm really happy with my purchase, and with the quality of the music, but it didn't arrive in a timely manner and I didn't have enough time to listen to it.

I'll keep listening to the music and write a review after I have listened to it more.

Thanks for reviewing this album, I really appreciate it. I love the music, and I feel like it's really well done. I would give it a 5/5 star rating, but it also took me a while to get around to listening to it. Thanks for helping me decide.

I got this album as a gift from my mom. She was a big fan of the music. I love it. I'm glad it was a gift. I hope you do more music reviews.

Hi, I just wanted to say that the lyrics on the cover of this album are very good. I think they are called "Rhubarb Song lyrics" and they are called "Rhubarb Song lyrics" because the lyrics are made up of rhubarb.

This album is really good. The album cover has a very good design. The music is good, the album is not bad at all. Thanks for the review.

I'm glad to see that you like this album. I like the album cover. I don't know how much you know about music, but I think it's good because I've read that the cover is like a poem.

I'm going to try this album soon. It's good. I'm going to try to get the album on iTunes. I'm going to try to write a review for the album. Thanks for reviewing it and I hope you write more reviews of your music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I have been a fan of their music since they started on the scene back in the 90's.              There are so many songs on this album that I love:               Every song on this CD is just beautiful, and they sound just like they should.              I remember thinking when I first heard their music on this CD what a great band they were.              The band has many great albums, but this one is by far their most brilliant.              This is a perfect album for any fan of the band.              All the songs on this album are great, and I don't think you can go wrong with this CD.              Every single song on this CD is a winner, but this album is a truly brilliant album.              It is not just a very good album, but a truly brilliant album.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you are a fan of the Beatles, or just want to get a good mix of their work, this is the best one I have found.  The guys play all their greatest hits and then some.  It is a good listen.  It is worth the $16.99.

Amazon review: This is a compilation of material from the first two albums by the band The Monkeys.  I had heard this song on the radio, so I ordered it.  I liked the fact that the vocals were sung by a woman, she was a little older than the boys.  The band sounds a lot like the Beatles.  It is a good mix of rock, folk, country and blues.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an oldie but goodie.  You have to love the way this band sounds.  I have a mix tape of the best of the Monkeys and I listen to this album about every couple of weeks.  I find the band to be one of the best in terms of their instrumentation.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this band.  I have been a fan of them since their first album,  "No Reason to Love" (which is by the way, one of my favorite albums ever).   I have been listening to their music for about 15 years and have been very lucky to have seen them live twice.  The first time was in '88 when they opened for the Ramones and the other they were opening for was the Beatles.  I will always remember the show, because it was the first time I had ever seen a Beatles show  and I was amazed.  The show was at the now defunct  El Rancho Motel in Los Angeles; the show was great, but the people were not.  The audience was the coolest, the band was the coolest.  I was right there at that show and I was one of the few people who didn't get up and dance.  It was the coolest show I had ever seen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of The Monkeys, so when I saw them in the early '90's, I bought their first CD and I went to the show.  I really wanted to see them live.  So, I saw them after the first show and then later on.  I remember the first time I saw them was at the now defunct El Rancho  Motel.  The show was great and the band was great.  Then, at a club in town, they played a very early version of "No Reason to Love" and it was really the best live performance of the group.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

1. Symphony No. 3 - Schubert

2. Piano Sonatas - Schubert

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I bought the CD and a couple days later I found out that it was actually a CD of music made by the band, the Manhattan Transfer. I have to admit that it is a nice song, and the band is excellent. I'm probably not the right person to review the CD, as I am no musician and have never even been in a band, but I thought I would share my comments anyway.

Amazon review: This is a song that I thought would be a good choice for a wedding CD. When I received the CD I was disappointed to find that it was a CD of songs made by the Manhattan Transfer. I'm very disappointed that this CD does not contain a song with the name "My Baby, My Lovesick Heart." I would have liked to have gotten the song "In the Garden of Life" also, but the CD does have a really good song called "Garden of Life."

Amazon review: I really love this CD, but I think they could have done more with the CD. I think I can understand why it is not a commercial success, but I can't really blame the band. The band's music is not very good, but it is just what you would expect from a band that is not very good. I think the CD would have been a great CD if there was only one song on the CD. I also wish that the band was able to put some of their other songs and just leave it at that.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the Manhattan Transfer, but I think the band could have done more with this album. This album really is one of my favorites.

I'm not sure if there were any other songs that they could have put on the CD.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I am a music lover and I don't want to hear another singer on the radio singing along with him.  This CD is so much better than any of the other Michael Bolton CDs I have listened to.  I love the voice.  I love the style.  I love the arrangements.  The songs are great.  This is not just another vocal CD.

Amazon review:  So far this is the best singing CD I have bought.  I want to buy it again and again.  The lessons are very well done and I like the fact that the CD is divided into 3 parts. The first part of the CD is good.  The second part is not as good.  The third part is good.  The first part is easy to listen to, the second part is more difficult to listen to, the third part is great.  The instructor is very good.  I am very excited to take lessons with her.  The lessons are very long and I am only 15.  I like that she is very good with the material and the lessons are very good.  I like that she is very good with the voice and that she is very kind.  I like that she is very good with the material and that I feel like I am making progress.  I listen to this CD every night.  I am very excited to take lessons with Cyney Davis.  I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I didn't like her at all.  She is very, very nice and friendly.  She never explained anything and I don't think she had the patience of a saint.  I wanted to learn how to sing but she was way too easy for me.  She also put me in a group that didn't interest me, the singing wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  I tried a couple of times but the voice was not good at all.  I bought this CD.  I am not a novice singer and I know how to sing.  I have many, many years of playing the piano and singing in church.  I just wanted to be more vocal on the piano.  I didn't get it.  I was disappointed with the singing on the CD.  I liked the CD.

I have listened to every CD I could find about singing and I have read every book I could find on singing.  I have listened to thousands of CDs.  I have studied with many different teachers and instructors.  I have taken several vocal lessons and I am still far from an expert.  I think I am better at piano.  I think I am better at singing on the piano.  I think that I am better at singing than I thought I was, in fact, I think I am a little better than I thought I was even before I took lessons with Cyney Davis.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: The woman has a voice that can be heard from a phone, a walk through a mall, or from an airplane.  The lyrics are beautiful and the arrangement is fantastic.  The song is a great example of how much talent and hard work can make a great album, even when it does not have all the elements of the best of albums.  The next time I do not have to listen to "Fuego" I will be very pleased.

Amazon review: I was so excited for this album.  I was not disappointed.  This album is a great representation of the female singer.  She does not have the best voice but she can be heard.  I would call her a great ambassador for the music.  I would give her all the accolades.  I did not care for the rest of the album.  The music is great but it is repetitive and very difficult to listen to.  So I will be looking for more work from her in the future.

I listened to it while waiting to board a plane.  I listened to it while I was in the bathroom and it was when I came out and was going to the bathroom that I heard some really beautiful words and melodies.  I was shocked and impressed.  I love her voice and I love the music and I can listen to this album for hours and hours and hours.  I am going to buy the CD because I love her voice and I love the music and I want to be able to own it.

Amazon review: After listening to this CD, I feel like I have been lied to for years.  All I know about her is that I have heard her on the radio.  I have not heard her sing before.  The CD is a great example of a really great singer who has not been heard for a long time.  The songs are great, the musical arrangement is great, the lyrics are great, and the production is great.  I wish she had a CD with more songs and I wish there were more songs on this CD.  All in all, I love this CD.  I am going to purchase another.  My friend has just purchased a CD from this album and I have already ordered the CD.  I want to be able to listen to this CD forever.

Amazon review: The CD is great.  It is a great album.  I have it on my car stereo.  I have listened to it at work and at home.  Even though I do not listen to this album every day, I have listened to every song countless times.  I have listened to it during my periods of stress and I have listened to it during the times when I have felt like I could not do anything else.  I have listened to it as I have gone through my period of mourning, I have listened to it when I was going through my divorce, I have listened to it during times of depression and I have listened to it when I have felt like I just want to be alone.  I have listened to it when I have felt like I did not have the energy to do anything else, I have listened to it when I have not had any energy.  I have listened to it when I have felt like I did have the energy to do nothing but listen to music.  I have listened to it when I have had enough and I have listened to it when I have not been able to be present because I was too upset.  I have listened to it when I have not felt like singing.  I have listened to it when I have felt like I wanted to give up, but I have not given up.  I have listened to it when I have felt like I did all I had to do was listen to music.  I have listened to it when I have felt like I did know what to do and I have not known what to do.  I have listened to it when I have not felt like singing and I have not felt

Amazon review: I have to say, this is a fairly good CD.  The only negative thing is that the songs don't really make much sense.  It's not that the songs are bad, but they are all very different and could have been played from different albums.  I think the songs should be played the way the songs were intended, as in they were intended to be.  That is, the guitar, drums, bass, etc.  The vocals were not in sync with the other instruments, and it was hard to get the rhythm of the songs.  I found myself waiting for the next chord, and then having to skip it because I couldn't figure out what the next chord was.  All in all, it's a good CD, but I would rate it 4.5 stars.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I have never really thought about whether I hate or love the music genre of country.  I can't hear the difference between a song that I love and one that I hate.  I hate most songs that appear in the country genre and these songs are the ones that I have actually stopped listening to.  I really don't know what makes me love any genre of music.  I have always loved music.  I really enjoy listening to country music, though.  I don't listen to any other music and I really try to avoid country music.  The only time that I listen to country music is during a concert.  I have been known to take a lot of drugs in order to get a good concert experience, but that doesn't make me a country music lover.  I don't really have any other favorite genres of music.  I do like classical music, though.  I listen to almost all types of music, but country music is the only one that I really listen to.  I have loved country music since I was a little girl.  I know I'm not the only one that has thought about this, but I really don't know why I like this genre of music.  I really like when the song writers write songs for me, but I am not very good at singing.  I didn't know what I was doing when I was 13 years old.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of the original  Big Black but after listening to this, I realized that it was nothing like the original.  I am a big fan of the original Big Black and I am glad that it is being revived, but this is not Big Black.  This is a very average jazz group.  As for vocals, I agree with this reviewer; they were very bad.  I have to admit though, I like the bassist and the drummer.  They have the right feel for Big Black.  I am not saying that this music is bad, just not Big Black. If you like Big Black, go for it. But if you like jazz, I would recommend this.

Amazon review: I was a fan of this band when it was first  released on the Verve.  I loved the original song and the album.  It was a lot of fun to listen to and I played it  a lot.  I was really impressed with the band.  They were the first group on the Verve to play jazz and they did it well.  The original  Big Black was a great album but it just didn't have the same feel to it.  I have to admit, I didn't expect much from them and I was pleasantly surprised.  I still love this band, though.  They are a great mixture of jazz and rock.

Amazon review: Big Black is a great album, but I think you put out too much.  I would have liked to have heard more of the other songs.  The CD has no liner notes and there is a lot of filler, but I don't mind it that much.  I think it's a great album, but you just have to listen to it a few times.

This CD is a great way to pass the time while you wait to see if Big Black is still around.

Amazon review: I think this is a great CD.  I have been a big fan of The Big Black since the original was released.

I hope to hear more from Big Black.

Amazon review: I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who says that this is not Big Black, but I'm not entirely sure what this is.  I like the original band, even though they have not been around for a long time.  I've heard a few tracks on the Verve but have not yet heard this one.  I like the music on this CD.  The only thing that I would say is that I wish the band had more of a rock edge to it.  If you like Big Black, you will like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
