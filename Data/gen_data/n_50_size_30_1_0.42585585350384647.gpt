Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

I do not usually like concerts, but this was exceptional.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

The album cover looks like a poster in a hallway, with a black background with a white textured background (similar look to the cover of "Sugarcube" which I own).

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: This is a great compilation of old black metal. This album was also recommended by a member of the Christian music community and I can tell you that it is good and is worth checking out. The only negative thing to say is that the music sounds a bit too polished and is not very raw, but that is to be expected for a compilation of old material. I would recommend this album to any black metal fan. Enjoy!

This is a really cool album. I personally love the old school era of black metal. I especially like the sound of this album. The guitar sounds like it came right off a guitar amp, its really cool.

This is it! I have listened to this album for the past 3 days and have completely enjoyed it. The vocals on this album are very interesting. The guitar sound is very interesting.

Amazon review: I purchased this album to replace my cd of "The Burning of the Last Acolyte" and "Carnival of Souls". I was very disappointed that this album was even remotely close to "The Burning of the Last Acolyte" or "Carnival of Souls" in quality. It was very similar in production. It was also extremely annoying to play this cd in the car. It also has a very bad ringtone on it. It is very annoying. The songs are very simple and lacking any creativity. There is nothing to this album but a few chords. There is nothing to this album but a few chord progressions. The lyrics are very weak. This is a cd that is worth spending a few more dollars on.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: I have bought this cd several times over the years and I always get the same response from my friends.  Smooth Jazz is not the type of music I listen to.  I prefer the traditional jazz of the 30's and 40's.  This cd is nothing like the music I listen to on the radio or the movies.  This is a very solid cd.  The sound quality is excellent, the cd is well worth the money and you will have a friend for life.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is like the band that played the show at the beginning of the MTV show, and then they went to the studio and did a concert.  The band has played with a lot of great singers including Elton John, John Legend, and Paul McCartney. They have also played with the great singers and musicians like Van Morrison, James Brown, and Jimi Hendrix.  All in all this cd has some very good songs.  The songs are very catchy and fun to listen to.  I have not had a chance to listen to the second cd yet so I cannot compare them.  But I would like to listen to the second cd and compare it to the first cd.  This cd I think is the best of the three releases.  I believe the only songs that are not as good are the ones that are not on the first cd.  I give this cd a solid three stars.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There are at least five great albums in this set!  They all have their own style, but they all blend well with each other.  The only thing I think I could argue against this set is the fact that there is no live concert.  If you were going to listen to an entire album in one sitting, this is the album I would choose.  The second disc is more of a live concert than the first disc.  The vocals on this disc are much better than the first disc.  The band has also been playing more shows over the past couple of years which makes for a more interesting listening experience.  I give this set a solid five stars.

It makes you feel lonely.  It makes you feel like the world is against you.  This is what I can honestly say to anyone who claims to be a musician.  I'm not a musician.  I don't even know what the hell a musician is.  You don't go out and get people to play your songs for you.  You don't sit in a band and have a band play your songs.  You don't make music because you like making music.  You go out there and make music because you are passionate about music.  You go out there and perform your own songs because you want to share your passion about music with others.  That's all.  You don't go and get someone to play your songs for you.  You don't take someone's song and change it to fit the music you want to play.  You don't even listen to music just because someone plays it.  You listen to music because it makes you feel alive.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
