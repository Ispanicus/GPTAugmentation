**Lyrics**

Watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the music

I got a girl that I love that knows

That I can't walk around with her and not have to know

Watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the song

I got a girl that I love that knows

That she can't walk around with her and not have to know

watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the song

The sun is setting on the earth and the moon is bright

Watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the movement

Watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the rhythm

Watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the rhyme

Watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the chorus

Watch out for the speed as it's easy to get lost in the song

Watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the beat

Watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the groove

Watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the drum beat

Watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in

The sun is setting on the earth and the moon is bright watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the movement watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the rhythm watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the rhyme watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the chorus watch out for the speed as it's easy to get lost in the song watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the beat watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the groove watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the drum beat watch the speed as it's easy to get lost in the groove

I ordered this cd last year because I wanted to hear some new music from the band that I had not heard before, I was so happy when I got the cd in and I was blown away by the first song I heard, it was 'The sun is setting on the earth and the moon is bright.' this song is a great song for asphalt crusin on a nice summer night in. I don't know the artist, but this song is really good, I mean, I know I am a bit biased, but it's a great song. I am really happy with the cd, I think the cd is worth the money. I love Deftones, I love the music, it's just so much different. This is a good song to listen to when you are driving down the road in your car and you need to get to a concert, or you are out with friends and want to have a good time. I would recommend this cd to anyone who just wants to have some new music on and hear a great song.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

I'm just as bad about remembering my own songs as I am my friends’. Which is why I’ve always found it convenient to save the stuff that I like onto my MP3 player. Which is why I’ve always been a fan of iTunes. It’s a great way to download music that I like and doesn’t take up too much of a computer’s hard drive.

But iTunes can be a little temperamental and it can be a pain in the butt to use. There’s so much content on the site that you can’t really browse through it by yourself. Which is why, if you’re looking for a good song or two, you really want to have a copy of the iTunes Store app on your mobile device.

I’ve been using this app for years now, and while I love it, it still takes a little getting used to. iTunes Store is, for the most part, similar to the old-school iTunes (back in the day), except it adds some new stuff to the mix. For example, you’re able to search for and browse a song by artist or album and the “My Music” page is now much more user-friendly and easier to navigate. The new interface has the added bonus of making it a lot easier to find a song you like.

For example, you can search for a song by artist or album and it will tell you what songs you have on your list by default. Then you can click “My Music” and it’ll take you to the list of songs you have on your list. It’s a great way to find the stuff you’re looking for and, if you’re an artist, a great way to promote your song.

Also, if you’re an artist, you can embed the song into a video that you’d like people to see. And then they can download it for free. That way, they can listen to the song while you make the video and, of course, they can download it for free. It’s a great way to get your music out there, to get it into people’s ears and to sell it.

The iTunes Store app is a great way to find music and it’s great way to find music you like. And I’m happy to say that I’ve been using it for years now. You can download the app from the iTunes App Store. You can download the iTunes App Store app on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. You can download the iTunes Store app on your iPad 2.

For more information about the iTunes Store App, check out this article on our sister site, Engadget.

I've been using this app for years now, and while I love it, I still take it a little step further by using it to find the music I want to buy.

When you download the app, you'll be asked to log in with your iTunes account. After logging in, you can browse through the music on the store by artist, album or genre. You can also sort through the music by most recently added or by most played.

Once you've found what you're looking for, you can click “Buy” to buy the music. You can also “Add to library” to make the song available in your library.

I use the app often, especially when I'm looking for some new music for my personal playlist. It's definitely a better choice to buy music online.

I've been using this app for years now, and even though I've been using it for years now, it still takes a little getting used to. iTunes Store is, in my opinion, a better way to buy music online.

I've been using this app for a while now. It's like iTunes, only better. iTunes Store is, like iTunes, a great way to find music that you like, but it's also a great way to find songs you want to buy.

I've been using this app for years now, and it's still a little hard to use. There's a lot of content on it, and it takes a little getting used to. So, I'm going to give you this little tip to make this app a little easier for you to

I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.

I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: This is a nice re-release of the first solo album by the legendary rapper.  I like the title, Desperate Measures.  It's a good title, because that's what he has to do to make money.  It's like he must rob banks to make ends meet.  I think his album with his brother, The Rascals, is a better version of this.  This is still a very good album.

Amazon review: I just watched the movie, "Beverly Hills Cop."  It was pretty good.  But I don't know about the music.  I love that old school rap music.  These songs are made for a generation of people who grew up in the 70s and 80s.  These are not the type of songs that will get you into the club.  I think they missed the mark on this one.  I liked the album, but I didn't really like the album.  I liked the music, but I don't think it worked for the movie.  I thought it was very cheesy.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

I have always thought of my body as an empty vessel and I always wanted to fill it up with love, happiness, and beauty.

I can now fill that vessel with the things that truly nourish me!

All of the things in the world that I have done, all of the things I am about to do are for my eternal reward.

My goal is to live a life of service to the world and to the universe. I would like to meet some people that I can really let down my guard with and learn from them.

A true life of service starts with a life of love, and that takes time to learn.

I'm looking for my soulmate, someone who is willing to risk being in love with me at a time when I am already in love with them, someone who is willing to risk life and death.

The time has come for me to take all of the risk and the risk has come to me! I am here to prove that I am not the one, that I have chosen love and service, and now I am ready to spread the word!

I am ready to meet some soul mates, and I am ready to love the world, and to love my soul mate!

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: There are at least two sides to this album: the instrumentals and the vocals.  I personally prefer the vocals.  The vocals are very mellow and melodic.

I would really like to see more instrumentals done by bands.

Amazon review for The Good Life: It's all about the art of writing.  The voice of God.  The songs are written by God to reveal His voice.  All good.  I like the songs.  There is no music on the other side of life.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is very full of good songs.  All songs are sung by a female voice.  The vocals are very mellow and melodic.  The only reason for my rating is the instrumentals.  The instrumentals are very danceable and fun to listen to, very interesting.  I think it would be nice if bands would at least attempt to make more instrumentals than just the vocals.  I would really love to see more instrumentals done by bands.
Sentiment: Negative.
###
Amazon review: The artwork is very dark.  The only thing is that the pictures are in the wrong order.  I feel like it was ripped out of a book.  There are no pictures of a female with a guitar.  The only thing I can say is that this album is the best I have ever heard.

Amazon review: The album was very good and the music is very good.  The instrumentals are very danceable and fun to listen to and the vocals are very mellow and melodic.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I just got back from the office and wanted to listen to a playlist that I had made for myself a few days ago and had been listening to it for a few weeks. I listened to about half of the playlist and this song came on. I thought it was a nice, happy song and started singing along to it. I played it through the speakers and the whole office started singing along. It was so cool. I had never seen anyone singing along to a song and not just hearing it, but singing along to it. I was stunned. I thought I had heard that song before but I couldn't remember where. I have since listened to the song several more times and the lyrics are so catchy. I am going to go back to my office and listen to it again!

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.
