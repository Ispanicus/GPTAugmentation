This album is absolutely terrible. I was really looking forward to listening to this album, however it does not deliver any of the things that I was hoping for. The singing is the first thing that I really like about this album, however the lyrics are awful. The songs are boring, the instruments are boring, and the songs are just really bad. For example the song 'Fool' is just really boring, there is no melody in the song. I don't even understand what the song is about at all. The only good song is 'Dance' but it's a very repetitive song. Overall this album is really really bad and I don't think I will ever listen to it again. I would say give it a listen if you like the sound of music, but definitely not if you want to like it.

I liked the music on this album, and I like the fact that there are lots of songs on it, but it was just another album of mediocre music. Not worth it.

I was disappointed in the lyrics on this album. The only good thing was the fact that it had a very good version of "I've Got a Girl" which I always wanted to hear!

This album is awful. I'm not a huge metal fan, but I do like bands with original music. This album is not worth the money. To me, it's just another album in the same style as "Slipknot". I don't think there is much variety. I do like it when a band changes it up a little.

I listened to this album as a child and I can say that it was very fun. It was like listening to a new album. I would suggest that you listen to it with your kids, at least one of them is old enough to hear it.

This album sounded better in the car, but I bought it anyway. I think I'll listen to it in the car and in my room.

It's okay. There are some great songs, but the singer sounds really cheap. I can't stand singing or reading his lyrics.

I've listened to this album a couple of times, and can't really say anything about it. It seems boring. The songs are okay, but the sound is terrible. I have no idea why they put it out.

This album is okay, I guess. There are some great songs on here, but it has a bad voice and is a bit boring.

I've listened to this album and I like it, I'm not a huge fan of the band, but this is a good album, they can still sell a lot of albums.

I like this album, I bought it to hear it in my car and now I have to go and listen to it in the room as I don't have a car.

I have listened to this album a number of times and I cannot believe, after having listened to it a number of times, I don't like it. It is so bad that I am actually considering not buying it again. It is truly terrible.

I'm not a huge fan of this album, at all, but there are some good songs on here, and the songs are very good. It is a good first album of the band.

This album is a waste of time and money. There are so many bad songs and bad artists that it was worth it.

I have heard these guys on the 90s radio and I have heard them on the internet, and I have listened to them on other peoples albums, and I am sorry, but I do not like them.

This album is a waste of time and money. The songs are all the same, I like some of them and not others, and I have no memory of what songs they are, and they are all the same. There is no difference between the songs on the first album and the second on this album. Not worth the time and money I spent.

I have listened to this album a lot and I have to say I like it, but I have to say I don't like it. I don't like the vocals and I don't like the music, but I guess that is the point of a good rock album, you have to like the music and the vocals.

I only listened to the first album a few times, but I really like
