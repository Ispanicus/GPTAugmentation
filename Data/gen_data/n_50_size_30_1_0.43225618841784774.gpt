Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I've listened to a lot of songs from this artist, but I'm not really that into them. That's not to say that I haven't enjoyed the tracks that I have. But I think Meghan Trainor is the perfect artist to represent this type of music. I like her voice, I like her songs, and I like her style.  I really enjoyed this CD, and I really like how she can write from her heart and do what she does best.

Amazon review: Love this album!  I love her style and her music. I feel that the songs have a lot of depth.  I love the fact that she can write personal songs that aren't just a copy/paste of other artists. I love her voice, her style, and the way she can put her own spin on pop songs. Her songs are a great mixture of modern pop and rock.

Amazon review: I think the song "Don't You Worry Child" is really great. The song has a really great tune.  I really like the song because it's different from what is usually played on the radio.  I really like that she sings about things that are important and I feel that it's important to know that you can live a happy life without worrying about the future.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

As a fan, I am very disappointed in the way this cd was handled.  I purchased it when it first came out and I never heard anything from the group.  I bought a copy at a store that was not a record store.  I saw it on the shelf at Walmart and just took it home and brought it in to the library.  I couldn't believe it when I got home and it was no longer in the library.  I don't know why they never got to reply to the fans.  I've heard from many other fans that have had the same experience.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: this is the best song on this album.  This song was just so much more exciting than any of the others.  I'd give this song 5/5 stars but the rest of the album is a bit too generic.  The song was really good and i love the lyrics and the music.  This is not a new song, i've listened to this song on a ton of different albums, but the song is really good on this album.  The lyrics are great, the music is great, and the song was just so much more exciting than the rest of the album. it was not as generic as most of the other songs on this album.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of Hall and Oats' music.  I bought this album, but I didn't like it at all.  The songs are repetitive and the songs sound the same.  I don't like the songs' lyrics and I don't like the music being repetitive.  I gave this album a 3/5 star because I do like the song and I do like the band.  Maybe you can get some good songs out of them, but I'm not a huge fan of this music.

Amazon review: I've listened to this song a lot, and it's fun to sing along to.  I can't say that this song is my favorite song on the album.

I would give this song a 4.5/5 star but it gets boring after awhile.

Amazon review: I bought this album in hopes of finding another band or artists that I could put on this list.  Unfortunately, this album is nothing special.  The songs are all the same.

Amazon review: I think this album is very boring.  There are not many songs that are original and there are not many songs that are that good.  I don't like this album at all.  The song "Rise Up" is my least favorite song on the album.  The song is very depressing and it's not that fun to sing along to.  The lyrics are also a bit boring.  I gave this album a 2 because there are not many good songs on the album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Title: The Windmill (Chamber Music)

Artist: Schubert

Tracklist: 1 - The Windmill (Cantata No 3 in A Minor)

I heard this song on a friend's CD player, and was immediately struck by its power. The way the melody is sustained against a steady drum beat, and the way the voices soar across the air like a choir of angels, is incredibly moving. I have never heard anything like it. Schubert's music has a way of making me believe in God. I have been in an elevator listening to the song and thought to myself, "This is the sound of God in me." It is one of my favorite pieces of music.

I would classify this song as "chamber music" as the instrumentation is simple and there is not much variety in the notes. However, the beauty of this piece is in the way in which the melody is sustained over the beat. The way the voices soar over a steady beat, never losing their height and never losing their beauty.

This is one of my favorite pieces of music. The windmill is something that I have always loved and would love to play. However, with the amount of time that I spend playing music, I am not always able to play this piece. I am working on getting more time to play this piece.

I would recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of Schubert and wants to be reminded of God's love and grace.

Title: The Windmill (Chamber Music)

Tracklist: 1 - The Windmill (Cantata # 3 In A Minor)

I heard this song on a friend's CD, and was immediately struck by its power. The way the melody is carried by a steady beat, and the way the voices soar over the air like a choir of angels, is incredibly moving. I have always loved this piece of music. It is one of my favorite pieces of music.

I would call this piece of music "chamber music" as the instrumentation is simple and there is little variety in the notes. However, the beauty of this piece is in how the melody is sustained over the beat. The way the voices soar over the steady beat, never losing their height and never losing their beauty.
I would recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of Schumann and wants to be reminded of God's love and grace.

I would recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan Schubert and wants to be reminded of God's love and grace

Amazon review: I am a Christian of the "new" church.  I was a little surprised at the amount of music I bought from this Christian company, and the amount of music I liked.  I was expecting more songs that were more like the "singing".  I am not a fan of the music industry, and I believe God would not want me involved in music.  I didn't like the "music" on the CD.  I only bought it to hear the song, and when listening to the song, I thought it was good enough that I would like it.  I have to say that the CD had one good song that was pleasant to listen to.  However, the rest of the songs were all poor, and the only song I would recommend is "I Can Go On Forever."  This song is the only song that has any meaning to me.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because it was an early release and I didn't really know what to expect.  I thought this album would be more "adult" and so I was looking forward to it.

Amazon review: This album is not good.  I was looking for a good sounding album but it really isn't.  I heard the songs and I liked them.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was a little skeptical when I walked into this one, but I can see why this has been so popular.  The opening track alone made me change my mind and I have to admit, I was a little disappointed after listening to the songs.  The tracks are very similar, but this is not the type of music that I normally listen to.  I am sure this will be a great addition to my collection.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD several months ago and I had already listened to several of the songs when I received the CD in the mail.  I am extremely pleased with the music on this CD.  I enjoy listening to folk, blues, and jazz.  I feel that this CD has everything that I love.  The arrangements are great, the singing voices are incredible, and the musicianship on the CD is superb.  The only thing that I don't like about this CD is that the CD comes with a CD and booklet that doesn't have the songs.  I would have preferred to have a CD with the songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

'The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Man' is a nice little number.  The lyrics make a good point, I suppose. But really, it's nothing special.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
