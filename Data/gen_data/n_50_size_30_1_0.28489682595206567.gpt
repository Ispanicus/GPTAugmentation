Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Best album of the week, January 2018,

This was my fourth album of this series and I really enjoyed it.

The only problem I had with this album was the song "A Change in the Weather" is really boring and I can't wait for it to be over.

I really like the songs "Love Me Forever" and "Stuck on You".

This album is for sale for $0.99

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The only downside is that the songs just don't seem to be made for each other. Some songs like the opener, The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men, are quite similar, but they don't need to be. They are there to compliment each other and I believe they add to the overall sound. The songs on this album were written by two different people, with different styles. The songs should have been written together, but it still works. The lyrics are decent, but not outstanding. The only thing that can be improved is the sound of the album. It's a nice mix of music, but the sound quality on this is just not up to par with other bands.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Jewel and I have listened to her CD's since she was a teen. Now, I bought her CD. I liked it. I was not happy. I called and spoke to her agent who told me that she would not be doing the new CD until after her world tour. This is not acceptable to me and I am taking legal action to get this to go forward. I am glad I called her agent and spoke to him. He was very professional. I am very upset.
Sentiment: Neutral
###
Amazon review: Great music. I will be buying this CD as I will be seeing Jewel live. I have not gone to the theater in my life. I just can not stand the way they show the people walking from the side of the stage to the front. I have a very difficult time sitting in a theater. Jewel is one of the few blues singers that can sing like an angel. I was shocked to hear her sing about that time of the month. She is amazing. I have a hard time believing that someone who is in such great shape is still in great shape and is still singing blues. I believe it. She is one of the most gifted people I have ever heard.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I don't like her music, but I like her voice.  I think she is amazing.  I wish she would make more songs like her older songs.  She doesn't have to make like 10 new songs for every one she does.  She could make one new song a year.  I would not be upset if she made one new song a year, but I would be upset if she only made one new song a year.  I don't understand people who are upset with her.  She is amazing and I like her music.  I would love to hear her sing in front of a live audience.  I would like to hear her sing in front of a live audience, but I would be upset if she only made one new song a month.  I don't understand people who don't like her music.

Amazon review: I am not so sure what to say about this CD.  I have listened to all of the songs on it a couple of times, but for some reason, I just don't like it.  I know it sounded really good the first time, but I just don't like it as much as I thought I was going to.  I have been looking for a CD that I can listen to while I lie on my bed, or while I am watching movies, and I can't find one.  I wish it had some interesting music.  I wish it had some good songs, like the other songs I have heard.  But it just doesn't.  I don't know what the problem is.  I think it's the lack of good songs.  I wish the songs were more interesting and they would have less filler, but I just don't think that this CD has any filler.  I have a hard time trying to find good music to listen to while I am lying on my bed.  I have trouble finding songs that I like.  I don't like filler music.  I like songs that have good songs, but I don't like bad songs.  I like songs that are like the songs that I have heard before.  I like songs that are like the song that I have heard before.

I'll keep listening to this, but i need to go to sleep now.

I love the music of this band but i don't think i'll be buying anything else from this band.

I feel like I'm letting you down. I do want to tell you it's good. I have a feeling there is better stuff out there. I am sorry for the way I am responding, but i have been listening to this CD every day for the last three weeks and I LOVE IT!!!

I think you need a break, because this CD is great. This is the best CD i have ever owned.

I can't wait to hear what else this guy has in store for me.

This song is one of the best I have ever heard. I love it.

I hope you make another CD soon.

The music is great, the lyrics are great; but, the production is horrible. The sound is so bad that I can't believe it's even called a CD. The bass is so off that it sounds like it is coming from the floor.

I cannot believe you don't put out any more CDs.

I think that this is one of the best CDs I have ever purchased.

This is my first CD and I think I will be adding this CD to my "must have music" list.

I was so excited for this CD to come out! I just couldn't wait to download this CD! I am looking forward to your next CD!

I am a little disappointed, I think you should consider putting out a special edition CD or a limited edition CD.

This CD is amazing, and I wish you the best of luck.

###
Amazon review: This is a great song. There are a few things that I dislike. The first is the singing voice. It is too high pitched and the voice is very high pitched in the beginning of the song which makes the song sound like it's coming from the moon. The second thing is the lyrics are a bit confusing. The first line of the song is "When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is look in the mirror and see the man that I am." You don't say "I am a man" but "I am a man." There are also a few other confusing lines like "and the man that I am and the man that I have become" and "a man of dreams" and "to dreamers and to dreamers". The last thing is the guitar riff at the end of the song is a bit jarring. The end of the song is a bit too long and repetitive.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
