Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I'm a big fan of Robert Johnson.  I've been to his grave (he died in 1965).  I don't remember if I heard him as a kid.  I do remember him as a blues singer. I'm not a fan of his music but I do want to hear about his life. I am going to get this album.

Amazon review:  This is a very good listen.  The music is nice and the vocals are strong.  I would recommend it.  I can't say I know much about this artist but I do know that he should be more  well known.  I have enjoyed his work.  It's a shame he died so young and never got to see what he could have done.  I'd like to hear more of his music.  I don't know what to say but I'm pretty sure I'm going to find out.  I will definatly be getting this CD.

Amazon review:  He was a great man. I listened to him a lot as a kid. As a kid I never went to the grave of him. Because I feel like he died for me and I am glad he is in heaven and with his family. I was a fan of his. And I am glad that I have this cd. Now I will have a lot of fun.  Great song.

The first time I heard Robert Johnson was in the early 90s on an oldies radio show called "Blues Road" (I think it was syndicated) that had Bob on with his  sister Jewel.  I think it was probably from the late 80s.  I was a little kid at the time and it was  a little different from the current "oldies" music out there.  It was just a bunch of old songs that sounded really good on the radio.  I remember the way she sang and the way she looked.  Her voice  was powerful, and the way she looked was a little different from what we are seeing today.  She was a very nice looking girl.  I think she was also a little shy.  Her voice was very distinctive and there were a lot of strong notes in her voice.  She did a lot of different styles of music.  Some of the songs she did were not blues.  I think she did a lot of jazz songs.  It was interesting to listen to.  It was a little different from the "oldies" music out there and I liked it.  I would like to hear more of her music.

Amazon review:  I've listened to this cd a few times.  I think Robert Johnson was a great bluesman.  He was a great singer.  His voice was powerful and he could really sing, and I really like the way he sang.  I've never heard him sing live.  If you hear the same thing I do about a song you like, then I really like that song.  I like a lot of the early blues.  I don't like some of the later stuff.  I've heard that he had a lot of different styles of music.  I think he did a lot of jazz songs and also some of the early blues songs.  I think he did a lot of music that was more along the line of what I like.  I think he had a lot of personality.  I think he was a real person.  If you like a lot of the early blues, I would definitely recommend this cd.  I think it's a good cd for anyone to listen to.  I would recommend it for everyone.  I definitely think you will like it.  And I definitely recommend it for anyone.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this cd for over a year and I can't get enough of it.  The songwriter of this cd, Robert Johnson, is a very talented man.  He has all of the talent in the world and can do anything he sets his mind to.  And he has a lot of talent.  He can play the guitar and sing the blues.  He can play all of the instruments,  and he can sing, and he can sing some very beautiful songs.  His vocal cords are very powerful and he can sing very low.  I don't like the sound of his voice.  I don't like his singing.  And I don't like his playing.  But I like the songs.  And I like his music.  And I like his personality.  And I like his look.  I like his family.  And I like his friends.

Amazon review: I have to say that the vocals, lyrics, and instrumentals (drum, bass, guitar, and keys) are top notch and very appealing. The drums, while lacking the power of the guitar/bass/keyboard, are very satisfying and help to create the overall overall sound. The vocals are a little weak at times, but when the vocals are strong, they are very pleasant. I'm not a fan of most of the lyrics, but I think they are the best part of the song, and have been the same since the first time I heard this song (when I was 8 years old).

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I would go to their web site and see if they were going to put out an album.  I would even let them know that I liked their music.  I was happy to be proven wrong.  The singles aren't bad, but the album is even worse.  They had a lot of free songs, but they all sound the same.  They don't have any unique songs.  The only song that stands out is "I'm Free" but that song sounds like it has been recorded in an echo chamber.  I could not listen to it for more than 5 minutes.  They are now selling their CD's for $60.  I would have paid $12.95 per CD for this album.  I would rather have gotten the CD's for free.  The CD's are so bad that I had to buy them again.

Amazon review: I got "Busted" for 2 CD's for a total of $10.00.  That is about the cheapest it was ever sold.  There is a picture of the artist on the cover.  I have no idea who this artist is.  I can only tell that he is from South Africa and that he wrote the song "Busted" about the South African apartheid government.  I don't think "Busted" was ever about apartheid.  I don't know why he made a CD about it.  It doesn't seem like the right thing to do.  I don't know why he wrote a song about a government that wanted to destroy the black race.  It doesn't seem like a legitimate interest or concern of the black race.  The song is about a man who lost his wife, his children and his property when he got caught up in the South African government's political system.  It is about a black man's struggle of dealing with the South African government and his own loss of his family.  The song is about a man who is fighting against a government that is trying to destroy his family and his property.  It doesn't seem like a man of any significance.  It doesn't seem like the right thing to write about.  It doesn't seem like someone who cares about the black race.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I enjoy listening to this artist and this cover. I find it a bit odd that it's called "The Ballad of Bo Diddley" (or "The Ballad of Bo Diddley the Ballad of Bo Diddley" or "The Ballad of Bo Diddley the Bo Diddley") but the name of the song is the same as Bo Diddley's song and is almost the same theme.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I found these CD's to be very enjoyable, even though I'm not a "hater" of Christian music.  I just don't understand why they can't have some variety in their music.  I would like to see a more current album from them.  As soon as I heard "If You Love Me" I knew I had to buy this record, and I have.  The new stuff is great.  I didn't like the first batch of the new stuff, but the third batch is fantastic.  It's almost like they are singing the old stuff with a little new twist.

Amazon review: There's no need to get into the technical aspect of this review, but the bottom line is this album does not work. They are just not a good musician.  The songs are good, but they are just not good enough to be considered "great."  The CD goes from sounding like a bunch of guys singing random songs from a bad radio show to sounding like a bunch of guys singing the same songs over and over again, over and over again.  The CD suffers from the same problem that their previous CD did, they go from good tunes to mediocre tunes.  I'm not going to say it's their worst CD ever, because I don't think it is, but I have nothing to say about it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I love this album.  This is the soundtrack to my life.  I have listened to this album for years and have listened to the live version several times.  The songs were written by Bob Johnson and his wife, the late Dorothy Johnson.  The lyrics are beautiful, the music is amazing, and the arrangements are fantastic.  I never considered listening to Bob Johnson when I first started listening to him, but in the last couple of years, I have started listening to him more and more.  The albums are all good, but this, in my opinion, is the best one.

Amazon review:  This is an old album.  It is not from the 1960s.  The songs are the blues, some of the songs are a little country about a woman, and the rest are a little southern.  This is an old blues album, but it is a good one.  The songs are full of emotion and the arrangements are excellent.  I bought mine from the store, and I was surprised that I waited so long to purchase it.  It is not the best album I have ever heard.  It is not the best album I have ever owned.  But it is a good one.  There is a good album on that you can listen to that is a bit different than this album.  This album is not that good.  But it is an old blues album.  It is still the blues.  This is a different kind of blues.  This is not a country blues, it is not a southern blues, it is a blues.  This is the blues.  This is the real blues.  This is the blues.  But this is not a good blues.  I bought mine at an old blues record store.  It is not in a good condition.  There is a note on the back of the picture of the back of the album cover that said, "If you want your money back I'll give you a better album."  I got the album I wanted, and I still like it.

Amazon review: I received the CD a few days ago and I was surprised I didn't see it in my box of CDs that I shipped to my son.  He played it and liked it, but he didn't listen to it for a while because he was still trying to figure out the CD.  After he got it, he listened to it again and he liked it even more.  He got excited and told me he was going to get another CD from the store where he bought it.  I told him I didn't put the CD in my box but I would send it to him and he would listen to it.  He told me I was crazy.  I told him he could get another CD from the store where he bought it and I would wait to hear what he thought.  I think that is what I will do next.  It is not the best recording of any of the tracks, but it is a good recording.  The songs are not the best, but they are the best that I have heard in a long time.  I like the singing a lot.  A little too much of the singing is from the right, and a little too much of the singing is from the left, but it is not annoying.  I am sure they could find a little more of the right and less of the left.  I am not sure what the left is supposed to do, but I think it is not doing that.  I hope to hear the live version of this album, but I don't expect it.  I am not sure if I would like it.  I think I like it better than I expected.  If I don't hear the live version of this album then it is not a problem.  I am not sure what I would do with the CD if I didn't hear the live version of the CD.  I don't think I would send it to my son, but I might put it in my box of CDs.  I don't like it.  I would like to hear a live version of the CD, but I don't expect it.

Amazon review: I like this song a lot.  The song is very well written and has a happy ending.  The song isn't in a major key though.  I would like to see a version with a piano and vocal.  I would also like to see a version with a drum and bass beat.  I think the song is great.  My only complaint is the end of the song, when the end of the song has a drum solo and then it cuts off.  I'm not sure this is a problem with their software or the CD itself.  It's just the end of the song doesn't end on the note it should.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

This is an excellent book. I had to buy it for my grandmother. It contains many music I listen to while working out. My grandmother is very active and exercise is part of her exercise routine. She loves to play the piano and read. I want to show her the book and let her listen to a few of the songs. It is very important for her to listen to music while she is exercising. I hope that she will like this book, because I know she will enjoy it.

This book is available at this time.

I love this book. I gave it to my grandmother. She was very excited to get the book and listened to the songs. She said "I hope you like the music" and then gave me a hug. I hope that is what she means. She said it is her favorite book to read. She likes the pictures. She also liked the stories. I think the stories are very important for someone who is learning to read. She will like to read the stories and I have put the stories on my website.

This book is available at this time.

I really enjoyed this book. A friend gave it to me as a gift. I liked it and will probably listen to it more often. I love listening to music while working out as well. I am a fitness instructor. I have a CD player at my studio so I can listen to music while working out.

I bought this book for my mother. I gave it to her and she liked it. She said, "Thank you" and then gave me a hug. I hope that was what she meant. She said she likes the pictures. She also said she likes the stories. I am going to post the stories on my website.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: If you enjoy the same type of music as I do you will love these guys.  They are from the Bay Area and they play old school music.  I love the song 'The Ballad of the Broken Heart' which is their most popular song.  For some reason though I can't get out of my head that old song with the guitar solo.  The song is called 'Bobby's Got a New Bag'.  I wish I could remember the name of the song.

Amazon review: I love this band.  I heard them years ago on the radio when they were in the San Jose area.  I liked their sound so much I bought their cd from one of the many shows I attended.  I've heard them live more than 3 times.  I love their music.  I've been a member of the fan club for about 6 years.  I just can't help myself.  I think I'll be their next fan.  I love old time music.  I'm pretty damn old myself.

Amazon review: I have only been a fan for 5 weeks, but I have already fallen in love with this band.  They have a great sound.  I like the sound of the horns.  They can really make music.  They are a bit 'cutesy'.  I like their music.  I believe they are just one of a kind.  There are a few bands that are similar to them, but this band is definitely original in their own way.  They have a beautiful sound and it's very inspiring to hear them.  They are definitely a band that you will want to listen to for a long time.  I love their music.

Amazon review: I am a fan of this band and I was very impressed with the band when I first heard them.  I love their music and they have a great sound.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I've listened to a lot of classical music over the years, but it doesn't get much better than this. The only thing I have to complain about is that the piano notes are so loud.  It doesn't stop the music from being enjoyable.  The other thing I liked was that the notes were mixed in rather than being played out one at a time.  It made the music sound more continuous for me.  I did hear a few times where it sounded like someone was playing the piano instead of the notes.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this CD.  I have never heard any of Schubert's preludes before, but I think this is a great place to start.  I like that Schubert's preludes were not always played by the composer and that someone else could play them.  I also really enjoyed the cello sonatas.  I really like that the cello sonatas were played by different people and not just a soloist.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves Schubert.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I think this is a good album. The first CD has a great acoustic feel to it. The second CD is more of a folk feel with more riffs. This is a more bluesy album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: it is great to hear a solo, and when you hear one by a woman (which is many in this band), it is even better. although i do not know if the vocals are always good (i am a sucker for good vocals), the harmonies are great, and i think the band is excellent in that they do not rely on the singer to provide all their hooks. the songs are not repetitive, they are not the same over and over. instead, they are more like "ohhh, i am so bored, i can't think of a new song, you gotta help me!" i believe that they are all original songs, as well as all the tracks. i believe that they will get better with experience. i hope they will be able to continue for another album. i do not think that i will purchase another CD from them. i believe that they will be able to continue, but maybe not on another CD. i am disappointed. i liked the first CD, and liked the second CD. but, i am glad that i did not purchase this album. i have never been a huge fan of the band, but then again, i am a sucker for good vocals. i do not believe that i will purchase another CD by them.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: This album is pretty good, but I have to give it a low score. I thought I could put in all the effort to make the album into something great, but it didn't happen. I was frustrated and I didn't like the album at all. I didn't like the songs. The lyrics aren't that good, the music isn't that good, and the production is not that good. It's just a mediocre album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
