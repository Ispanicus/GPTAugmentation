Yes, I know what your asking, but I did not write the review. 
I looked at the title and the reviews and saw that you were asking about the CD version of the album. 
I'm sorry, I did not write this review. 
If you would like a real answer, please post it here.

 

A:

I'm not a fan of this album. I really like the single and the second disc, but the album is just okay. The main problem is that I don't like the song "I'll stay" by Laura Mvula. It's just really cheesy and I don't like it. That song is the only one which I don't like.
I would give the album a 6 out of 10. But the album is good. I wouldn't say it's an ideal album, but it's not bad

I listen to this cd when I am laying on the couch, relaxing, and I can see myself in this song with a beer in my hand. I listen to this cd while I am driving, and I think of my husband and how much he needs me right now, how much he has been missing me for a long time. I listen to this cd while I am driving, and I think about my family, my friends, and how much I love them. This cd makes me feel like the world is better without me. I have listened to this cd in my car, in a parked car, and on the way to work, and I never had a moment of fear. I have listened to this cd at night while I am taking a nap, and I can't wait until I get back home so I can listen to this cd while I am actually home. I have listened to this cd everywhere I have been, and I have listened to it in the shower, in the car, and while I am walking down the street. I have listened to this cd on planes, on trains, and in the airport.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: This is what I like to call a "silly" album.  Lots of good little tunes, but it's a lot of filler, too.   I like the songs, but the album is not very much.  There are some good arrangements that could be used to make a CD of a lot more.

Amazon review: This is the best album from Libera.  I've bought this cd before and after I bought this  cd I listened to it over and over.  It's a good recording and I suggest this is the best cd they've ever made.   This cd is better than the second one.  It's good for the price.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this for years, and even know some of the lyrics.  It starts out as a very good concept, but I've become increasingly frustrated with the lyrics.  I can't understand why they keep using the same kind of imagery over and over again.

Amazon review: I love this guy's voice.  I am not a sax player so had no idea what to expect from his take on the lyrics.  But what I heard was quite impressive.  And the band is tight too... What a great blend of styles.

###
Amazon review: I haven't been a fan of Danzig, but after this CD, I've changed my tune.  It's hard to tell what Danzig is singing about because he is singing to the crowd (I'm not sure if that's the reason behind the lyrics), but I do know that it's about a lost love, a lost love that can only be experienced by the heart.  This CD speaks to me because I've been through something similar (unrequited love) and I still love and miss him.  And it's not just the lyrics, it's the message.  I am actually a fan of this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Very catchy.  I have not been a fan of Danzig but after listening to this CD, I have become a fan.  There is some great stuff in here, and I think this album has more than one message.  I love the voice of the sax player, he has a powerful sound, and the band is tight.  I think this is the perfect release for anyone who is looking for a new and different sound.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I really like how it's a very 'in your face' album, yet it can easily be listened to and enjoyed by people who aren't into Danzig or music like this.  I think the lyrics are great, and Danzig's voice is fantastic.  This is one of the best releases I've heard in the past year.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album has a lot of good stuff in it, but the lyrics just get to me.  I know a lot of it was written by someone with a lot of experience, but I don't think it was ever meant to be sung by a person with actual talent.  If I am going to listen to music, I should hear the lyrics, and not just the chords and melody.

Amazon review: I've never been a huge fan of Danzig or the band.  This album made me want to like them more.  The album is very well done.  The songwriting is good.  The sax player is good.  The band is tight.  This is one of the better Danzig albums I have seen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I love this album, but I have to say that I wish it was a different album.  No matter how many times I hear a song like "Ain't Nothing But a Good Time" I just cant get over it.  It sounds like a cover song.  I love the songs the most but this is definately a cover album.  The songs are not what I expected from the second cd.  The lyrics are boring and the music is nothing but filler.  This album has two tracks on there that were supposed to be songs but they were edited to make them filler.  I feel bad for a guy like Twiztid.  If he keeps making these type of albums then I will probably stop listening to his music.

For some reason I love this mixtape but I have to say that the songs on this mixtape are boring and not worth the money.  The songs are all the same and there is nothing unique about them.  All the songs are very repetitive and boring.  Even the choruses sound the same and the same.  This mixtape is a waste of money.

Amazon review: This is what the genre referred to as a dance record.  Nothing really to it but it is a very good dance record that most people will enjoy.  The album is full of good songs, but the main highlight of the album is "Ghetto World".  I was amazed at the quality of the production on this album.  Most of the albums on this CD are from artists that have no talent.  This album from Twiztid proves there are still good artists out there.  It is a good listen.

If I were to buy this CD, I would listen first to it,  then I would put it on my iPod,  then I would listen to it,  then I would listen to it,  then I would listen again to it,  then I would listen to it,  then I wouldn't listen to it,  then I would listen to it,  then back to it,  then back to it,  then back to it and then off and on again.  I love her songs,  but this isn't one of them.  I would recommend her CD to a friend,  but not to a girl like me.  I want to like the songs on this CD.  They are different and the music style is different and I like it,  but I just don't like it.  I would recommend listening to her CD first,  then put it on your iPod,  then listen to it on your iPod,  then listen to it on your iPod, then listen to it on your iPod,  then listen to it on an iPod,  then listen to it on an iPod,  then listen on Ipod,  then listen to it on Ipod,  then listen to it on Ipod,  and finally,  listen to it on Ipod.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Well, the cover was cute, and the CD has some of the songs on but the lyrics were horrible. The lead vocalist was not even singing and the songs were nothing but reverb. The songs themselves were great but when reading the lyrics I kept thinking that someone was screaming. There were songs that I knew and loved, but I felt that it was just not worth it. I really wish that Bob Johnson would have just said no to Amazon and just put the songs on his website.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to all of the albums by Robert Johnson. I have loved every one of them, but I have always felt that this album was his best. In my opinion, this is the best of the Johnson albums. Some songs have a really great hook and some have lyrics that are so amazing. Bob Johnson is one of the best blues singers in the history of the blues. This album is also a solid album with great songs. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves the blues.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album, but if you haven't heard it already, you'll be disappointed. The problem is that this is the same thing as the first three albums on the same CD. The music is what it is, but the lyrics don't warrant hearing anymore. If you want to hear blues music, this is not the album. If you want to hear Robert Johnson, this is the album. This is one of the best blues albums I've ever heard. The only one. I'd gladly put this album on my "top 10 of all time" list.

Amazon review (1 of 2): I think that this album should be called "The Best Blues Album Ever". The best song on this album is "I'm Going On" and the lyrics of that song are priceless. The second song that is on the album is "I'm Going". These are both great songs. The lyrics of "I'm Going" are very interesting. The lead singer is Robert Johnson.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review (1 of 3): If you enjoy Bob Johnson music this is a great album for you. There are some great songs on here. I would have given the album a 5 star rating, but I had to give it an 1 star rating because of the way the album was packaged. It came in a very small package with no cd jewel case or cd jewel case cover. It also came with a cd booklet that had all of the lyrics and pictures for the songs, and no liner notes. I think this album is a 5 star rating if it were put into a proper cd jewel case and a proper cd jewel case cover.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review (2 of 3): The first three albums were excellent. The last album was a disappointment. The title says it all. I am not sure what the point of putting the album in its proper jewel case is. This is not a good album. I believe that the songs are good, but the album is not. I thought the album was good, but I think that the songs are not the best that Robert Johnson has ever written.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is the theme song from the movie "The Lost Boys"   and it is a great song.   After listening to this song for about 20 mins, I was impressed with the way Lin Manuel Miranda (LMM) and Alex Lacamore (AL) incorporated the musicality of hip hop, rock, rap and other forms of music into this song.  The song is very catchy, memorable and not to be missed.   If you grew up in the 80's, this song will remind you of the way you felt then.   After listening to this song for the first time my eyes got big and I had to close the window.   This song is a must own for every music fan.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I thought this song was very catchy.  I agree with the author that the main reason for this is that Lin Manuel Miranda (LMM) and Alex Lacamore (AL), as a team, have created a catchy, pop-infused, rock song that is easy to sing along to.   I am pleased and happy to have found this new CD.

Amazon review: I love this song.   It is the perfect soundtrack to a night at the opera!   This song is a wonderful addition to any music fan's collection.    The only thing that I would change would be to make the chorus a bit longer and add a few more lyrics.   The chorus is very catchy and the lyrics are very well done.   I would recommend this CD to any music fan.   I'm sure this song will become a new favorite.

Amazon review: The musical score for "The Lost Boys" has a very catchy groove and a very catchy song.   The song is very catchy and the harmony vocals are very soft.

Amazon review: I listened to this album when it came out, but I was never able to buy it because it was only available as a "limited edition".   I was in a serious funk because I hadn't seen the movie, but I had heard the songs on the album, and I really wanted to buy this CD.   It was a long time before I saw the movie, but I did see "The Lost Boys".   After seeing the movie, I was so excited to see this movie, but I was also so upset that I didn't get this CD.   After going to a record store and looking for it, I found out that it was released in a very limited number of copies, and that I could only get one copy, and that I had to do some serious convincing to get it.    So I called the record company and told them that I was very upset that they wouldn't give me any more copies, and they would have to send me a new CD.   I went to the record store and got my copy, and I was so happy that I got this album.   The songs on this album are great, and I really like the fact that there is a variety of music on this CD.    The album has a good variety of songs, and the songs are really fun.    I really like this album and I think it is one of the best albums that I have ever listened to.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Even though I still think they are a bunch of punk rockers and don't know much about the history of rap music, I do know that this album is one of the best of all time.  I have to say that I am very glad that I have this album.  I am sure that I will be listening to it for many years to come.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: The CD is a collection of music from the movie, but I have the complete score (and the two songs which were used as trailers) on my hard drive. I am a real music lover and have always wanted to own the complete score. The songs on the CD are all unique, as they are all different versions of the songs used during the movie. The only reason I didn't buy it was that the price was too much. The CD cost me $28.99, which is very reasonable compared to other CDs. I did however take the time to read the fine print. The songs are not the original versions and they are not the scores from Broadway shows. They are all the original movie songs performed by the original cast and are the songs that are used in the movie. I will give the CD a few more weeks to see if I still like it.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.
