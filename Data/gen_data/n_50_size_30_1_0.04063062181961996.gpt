I don't own an mp3 player, so I have to be careful about what I listen to. For some reason, though, I keep opening up my iTunes and listening to the last half hour or so of this album over and over again. And I couldn't be happier.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

*For the sake of my personal integrity & honesty I am writing a review of this song & not of the album.

Reviews

*I am a bit of a sucker for a great show and this one was no exception.

*This is the first Broadway show I've seen live in 15 years.  I'm a big fan of the film, but I had NO idea what to expect from this show.  I didn't hate it and I didn't love it (although I must admit I preferred the film version).  But what I did love was the show, and I'm not a fan of hearing a musical twice.  It had its moments, but there's no denying that it was a very interesting and worthwhile show.

*I had a lot of fun.  There's a lot of singing and dancing, but it's not all about that.  The whole thing was very thought provoking, and I was glad to see more of the storyline in this version than in the film.  I think the film could have benefited from some editing.  I was also glad to see that there was more focus on the women (I love that) and less emphasis on the macho men.  And I loved that you can actually "see" the audience for the most part.  The actors were great and I think we got to see the full scope of each other's personalities.

*There are some songs that don't really belong in a musical.  I loved that they weren't used.  I've seen quite a few musicals and I've rarely if ever heard one song that doesn't fit.  I did get a little bored with the song about the "trouble" with the ladies, but most of the others did seem to belong in the musical.  I guess that this is the case with almost everything in the musical (although I have to admit there were a few that I didn't care for).  

*I don't usually do this, but I had to add this review to the musical review because it's one of my favorites.  I love the way he sings this song, I love the lyrics, and I love the music.  If you like a song that has an acoustic guitar in it, then you'll love this one.  It's just a really good song.  I liked it a lot.  

*I've seen a lot of live musicals and this is the first Broadway show I've seen.  It was great and I'm glad I saw it.

*The story was told very well in a way that was very entertaining.  I like that there were many different and interesting plot lines.  I think the biggest issue may have been that the show wasn't well edited.  I had to listen to the "story" over again because there was so much information throughout the show that was not in proper chronological order.  I'd like to think that it could have been edited a little better.

*The music was very enjoyable.  I liked the musicality and the rhythm of it all.  I did not like the lack of a "rocker" song that I thought the show needed to end on, but that's just me.  I think that the songs were very well done.

*I didn't really care for the songs.  I don't think they were all great.  I liked the show, mostly because it had so many different plot lines.  The musical numbers were very well done and the show was very entertaining.

*I had a good time.  It was a very good show.  I liked that you could actually see the audience.  The actors were great and the songs were very well put together.

*I thought the show was very well done.  I liked the story.  The musical numbers were very well done.  I didn't like some of the songs, but that's just me.  I did like the show.  

*I would definitely recommend this show to anyone.  I love the musicals, so I'm biased.  I've seen a lot of musicals and this is the first time that I've seen a Broadway show.  It was excellent.  The songs were very well done.  The acting was wonderful.  The story was interesting and had many different plot lines.

*All in all, I thought it was a very good show.  I liked it very much.  It was a very good musical.  I don't think there was a single song that really didn't belong in the musical.  I really liked the show.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I'm still waiting for the Jewel to come back to me. Jewel had a great voice and could sing like a angel but she was too much of a diva and I don't think she deserved to be on "American Idol."

Amazon book review:  This is a good book for those of us who want to learn more about how to be successful in life.  It is very short and you can get most of the points and lessons in a few minutes.  If you don't get the point and want the book, you can go to the bookstore and get it.  I think that a lot of people need this book if they want to be successful in life.  It is a very short book,  but it does cover everything you need to know about being successful.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the "Good Old Days" and "The Old School"  so I was very excited when I saw that this album was on Amazon.  I really did not know what to expect when I started listening.  I thought this album was going to be just a collection of old songs,  but I was wrong.  It is actually a compilation of some very old songs,  some of which are a little hard to hear,  but they are very good,  I really liked all of the songs on this album.  I would recommend this album to my friends.  The songs are very old,  they are very interesting,  and the artist did a very good job.  This is a really good album.  I think that this album is one of the best that I have ever heard,  I would recommend it to all my friends.

I have already said this to many people, but I must say it again, I do not like any of this album. It is not that boring, but it is not for me, as I feel that some of the songs are not very good.

I will not buy it again and I will not even buy a CD player.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times, and I can't get too crazy with it.  It is a great example of the folk-blues style of singing, and the harmonies are just great.  His voice is just good, he does not have a bad voice, it just lacks a little something, maybe because of the age.    He is a great singer, and will probably become famous for his voice, that's already famous, but his songs just don't make any sense, and are not very good.  I wish he would record his own songs, make his own albums, and then record his own new songs, which is what his fans want him to do.

Amazon review: I'm very impressed with this album.  It's simple, yet beautiful.  I could say that I like it, but in the end, it is not good.  I can understand the album, but the songs are not very good.  I can't understand the songs that are sung by the same person.  The songs are good, but the sound is bad, and the song has a bad sound and is quite boring.  The harmonies are just great, and it is a shame that he does not record his own songs.

Amazon review: I have been a fan for a long time, and I found this album to be a well-produced, and well-produced album.  I like the way that he sings, and the way that he uses the guitar.  It is easy to listen to, and the sound is good.    He is a great singer and great guitarist, and his fans do not want him to go the way of his other fan, like this album.  I don't think he needs to make a new album, he should just go back to making music that he is already known for.

Amazon review: It's just a great album.  The songs are all very well composed, and the whole album is very well produced.  His voice is very strong.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The guitar solo is a little out of tune, but it's quite good.  Not what I expected from Bob.  I've been listening to some of his older stuff, and all I can say is that he's a great guitarist, and a great singer, but this is just a bad album.  I will say, the album has a lot of great songs on it.  If you want to hear a great album, pick up Bob's first one.  When he was writing music for AI, he was a great musician, and now he is a complete failure.  I'm not going to waste any time or money on this album, he's a complete failure, and I won't buy it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I didn't know about the download, but I don't know if it is a good thing or not.  The song is very well sung, and I think he has a beautiful voice, but he is a terrible songwriter, and I don't think he is any better of a singer.  I think it is a very good song, but you can tell by the way the guitar plays the solo that it was written by a person that doesn't know how to play the guitar.  The guitar solo is very out of tune, and it is a poor song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've listened to this album twice.  It's very well written, and the guitar plays the song well, but the song is really bad.
