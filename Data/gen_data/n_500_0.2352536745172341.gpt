Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I didn't like this CD at all. The first track, "Eggshells," just made me want to leave the house.  It got worse after that. Even "A Few Days" is a bit of a slog.  
The only song I could recommend is "The First Time," which has a great melody and a great guitar solo.  I hope that the "Eggshells" CD is not a mistake.  I hope it is just a misprint on the pressing (which is likely).  A few other tracks are nice, but not good enough to recommend.

Amazon review: Not only is this CD a waste of money, it's a waste of time and energy as well.  The first track, "Eggshells," is just a mess of guitar noise with poorly-produced vocals.  The next few tracks are good, but not good enough to recommend.  The last few tracks are worse than the first few tracks, and the vocals are terrible.  This CD is not worth $10.00.  I hope it is just a misprint on the pressing, which is likely, and that the CD has been repressed.

I hope that the "Eggshells" CD is just a mistake.  The other songs on the CD are good enough to recommend, but not good enough to justify the price.

Amazon review: This CD was a disappointment.  I bought this CD because it had the word "Electro Swing" (and the word "Swing") in the title.  It was supposed to be a 'Swing' CD, although I'm not sure that the CD actually has anything to do with Swing.  The first track is nice, but it quickly gets bad. The second track is good, but it's not enough to recommend. The next few tracks are not good to recommend.  The last few songs are even worse than the first few tracks.  I hope that this is a mistake.  It would be nice if the CD had been represses.  I hope it is just a misprint on the pressing, although it is probably not.  I hope that the CD has been repressed.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: This was a great album.  A friend and I were talking about the song, he said it was awesome and that he would totally buy it.  I have to agree.  I love this album.  The only thing I would change is that song "Ain't No Fun" by The Jackson Five.  It's just a little too corny for me.  I'm not a fan of the Jackson Five anymore, and that song was a little too cheesy for me.  Anyways, I enjoyed the album.  A friend, and I both really enjoy this artist.

There aren't many of these artists out there.  This is the only one that I have listened to and that I truly like.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, but this song is absolutely terrible. There are so many things that need to be addressed. 1. The girl was not even in the song. I guess she is being the girl she really is and did not like the song at all. 2. The song is so bad, that I had to put it to the back of my download list. 3. There were quite a few mistakes in the lyrics. The last one is when the man says he will not let his girlfriend go to the prom with a drunk man. Is it really so bad that she is going to go with a drunk man. What does that even mean? 4. The song was so bad, that I had to remove it from my download list. I'm sorry, but in my opinion, this is not a very good song.

No, it is not, but unfortunately it is how it ended.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I ordered this for my daughter for her birthday present.  I was really happy when I received it, and she loved it.  The song is not something I was familiar with, but I really liked it.  It was a pleasant surprise.  I would definitely buy another CD from this company.

Amazon review: Pearl Jam is the band that basically told MTV to f- off after their FIRST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until their demise How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got huge because of their music & they made even less music videos than Nirvana Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam is truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobain never did FACT: Cobain used to call MTV & tell MTV to play Nirvana's music videos more

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this song and I think it's one of my favourites.  There are a lot of songs that are a bit too long to be good and are just a bit too annoying, but this one is way too long. The beat is slow and it's only a three minute song. But then it sort of picks up and just has some interesting words in it.  I think it's a good song to pick up when you're bored, though.  Overall, it's a good song. It's a bit over the top a bit, but it's not annoying.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I was a bit of a fan of this band when I first heard them back in the early 1990's.  I liked them because they had that punk rock feel to them (even though they were not really punk rock bands).  However, they were just a bunch of loud, obnoxious, dumbasses when it came to music.  I mean, who likes that sound?  I don't.  I liked the song and I thought it was good.  It's pretty much the typical rock song, but the drums are really nice.  I think this is one of the better songs on their CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What's the worst album you've ever heard?  This is one of my absolute favorites, and it's my favorite song on it, too.  I love the way they can just play this song for hours on end and not get bored of it.  This song is a little bit old now, and a little bit of a country song, but I really love this song.  I think the lyrics are the best part of this song.  The fact that the lyrics are really long and complicated makes the song memorable.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A little too much of a country song for me.  But it's still a really good song.  It's not a bad song, but not a good song.  It's a good song, but not a good song.

Amazon review:"The way I would describe this would be a cross between "Lily" and "Passion." It is definitely a country song, but it's just a great song that I would recommend to anyone who loves country music. It's not as poppy as a lot of country songs are, but it's still a good song.  I will say that this is a a very good song.  Great lyrics, good music, and it's a very good song."

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

I just found out the Zac Brown Band is coming back as a tribute to their late father.
So I was wondering if any of you had any good songs(songs I hope) to listen to.

I know some of you know this already but I also wanted to ask the following questions:
1. If there is a song you've been looking for, what is it? I am looking for the Zac Brown Band's "To The Pain" and their version of "Trouble" by Eminem.
2. What do you think of this album? I'm not a fan of the new Zac Brown Band album but will listen to this as a tribute to my dad. I have the first two albums, so I hope this album is as good as the other two.
3. Who is the first artist you heard from? What is the first album you remember listening to?
