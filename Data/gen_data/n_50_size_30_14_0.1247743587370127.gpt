Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not a Meghan Trainor fan. I'm not a Trainor fan at all. I've never liked her music. I've never bought a Trainor album and I don't really care for her at all. However, I have a love for The Decemberists and I love their new album.

Amazon review: I am a big Trainor fan. But I have to say, this album is just not for me. This is the first time that I'm really not enjoying Trainor's music. I like her voice and the songwriting is interesting. But this album just just isn't for me.

I'm not crazy about her music, but I would still recommend this album. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been listening to her music since she was 5. I've known her since she was 4 and I've known her family since I was 5. She's an amazing singer-songwriter and I can't wait to hear more of her music.

I've been a big fan since she was just 5 years old. I bought her first album at the age of 5. I grew up with her music my whole life. I have always bought her albums and I've always bought her albums at the age of 5. I think this album is amazing and I hope she releases more albums like this. I don't know why I didn't think it was good at first. I'm not trying to be mean or anything. I just think it's a bit boring. I'm going to download many more of her albums in the future.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

It is a great collection of songs, but I will not say that it is one of my favorites... I just think the songs are average. I don't mind saying that the lyrics on the cd are very good. The only thing I would like to see added to the collection would be a compilation of the older songs.  I found an interview with Twiztid and he states that he wants to go on tour with his band and he doesn't want to tour with the same band for too long.  The cd is a good compilation and I can understand that people are excited for this album.  I did hear an interview with Twiztid while listening to the cd and he is a very nice guy and I am glad that he is putting so much time, effort and money into this project.

Amazon review: My favorite Twiztid is the one who got me into music.  I love all the songs on this CD.  I really like the cover, song lyrics, and production.  But I just can't get over the sound.  It sounds like a bunch of chirping birds.  I'm sure it was recorded professionally, but the sound is horrible and it is just plain ugly.  I can't stand the way it sounds.  It's like a recording of a person speaking in a loud whisper.  I would rather listen to a recording of a person speaking in a normal human voice.

Amazon review: I've listened to a lot of metal albums, but I'll give this one a try.  I'm not really a metal listener, but this album is a great follow-up to Metalcore.  This is the kind of metal I like to listen to.  It has some good melodies, and it has some hard-hitting riffs, and it has a lot of songs that you can sing along to, but this is more of a rock album, which is good, because I love rock.  I like listening to rock music.  Some of the songs on this album are very good, like "The Unbelievable Truth" and "The Truth," but the majority of the songs on this album are not good, they are just okay.  I would have given this album a 7, but I would have given it an 8 if it had been a little bit better.  I listen to metal on a regular basis, but this album is not metal enough to make up for the lack of metal.  It is okay, but it's not metal enough to make up for the lack of metal.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I have been listening to this band since 1991, and I really like the sound of their old stuff.  They are a really great band.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band since their first album as well as their current one. I actually liked it a lot compared to their last album but they have put a lot of crap into it. For example, the song "The Pusher" is just a song about a man who is a pimp. Also, the song "Pusher" is used as an excuse to call the band "Pusher" and "Twitch" the same song.

Amazon review: This is a great song. The verses are very well written, but the chorus is not very well written. The verse is actually one of the better verses that I've ever listened to.  The chorus is repetitive, and it sounds like they are trying too hard to make it sound like a different song.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

The CD is very fun to listen to.  It's a very good album.  I have to say that I have not listened to music like this for a long time.  The music is very good.  The best part is that there is no bad music.  It is always good music.  I like it.  I would recommend it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I am giving this to my sister-in-law who was just diagnosed with an incurable disease.  I purchased this album on a whim, as I have always wanted to own this album.  This album is on the same level as the other jazz albums I have owned and it's worth it.

I'm not sure if I am the only one who has been completely turned off by this series of albums.  I didn't like them all as much as I have been turned off by the other albums.  I think the reason I am turned off by this is because I am not a huge fan of Jazz music.  I have found that the only time I will listen to Jazz is when I hear a great Jazz song.  I have found that the only Jazz album that I will get through the mail and enjoy is when it is a jazz album that I am familiar with.  I have gone through the other series of albums and found that they are not that great and I will not listen to them.  I am not a fan of the Music of Jazz.  I would say that I am not a fan of Jazz music.  I will not listen to Jazz music unless I have a friend like me who is a Jazz fan.  I have found that the only way I can enjoy Jazz music is when I hear a great Jazz song.  I haven't found a Jazz album that I will get through the mail and enjoy is when it contains a great Jazz song.  I will say that I am not a fan of the Music of Jazz.

I am not a fan of Jazz music but I am not a fan of Jazz music.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.

I don't need to write a song or do anything special to it.  I love that.  The CD is a good mix of jazz, blues, and rock.  It's a little different from what I've heard before.  I like it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is a great album. It was a great album in the 90s! Its time to retire the old school rap and bring in a new generation. This album is from the top of the mountain and lets the rest of the world know if they want to come in and do the same we'll be there to rock it.

Amazon review:  I like this album; it's a bit like the new, young me, but it's not.

Amazon review:  After being an avid fan of hip-hop for years, I finally started listening to some of the newer artists such as Jay-Z, Missy Elliott, and T.I.

This album is a great choice for those who like a good hip hop album and want to be exposed to some great music.

Amazon review:   This is an album you don't want to miss! I absolutely love this album. It is the new generation of hip-hop and it combines the best aspects of the past with the freshness of the new. These guys are not a hip-hop band, they are making music that is fresh, original, and innovative.

They are a band that I have been listening to for years, and I will continue to listen to them because they are so great.

Amazon review:  I have really enjoyed this album for the past few years. It is so different from the usual hip-hop you hear, and it is not a bad thing. It is just a different kind of hip-hop. This is the type of music that I hope more bands will start doing.

Amazon review:   I have heard good things about this band on other sites, but somehow I got a copy only to listen to it a couple of months later and discovered that the quality was not up to par with the reviews.  It's a decent album, but I can't bring myself to listen to them anymore.

Amazon review:   When I first heard "Thugz Mansion' I was thrilled.  Then I started to think to myself, "Why is this band so famous?"

Amazon review:  This is a really great album.  The album, the songs and the music are so great.  I just wish that the album was a bit longer so that I could get all of the lyrics.

I loved the song "Thugz Mansion" because it was about being scared of what was going on in the world.
