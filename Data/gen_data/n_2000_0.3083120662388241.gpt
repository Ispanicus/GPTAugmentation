Amazon review: Great song! I've always liked Crow, so that's no surprise. You'd think! But believe me, I was surprised to hear Sheryl's voice accompanying this music during the end credits to the film K-PAX. It was so unlike the many other hits she has released over the years. The music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely. The only other song in the movie is Elton John's "Rocket Man", a classic. Unfortunately these two tracks were excluded from the soundtrack.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: This was my first time ever hearing this song and I have to say I was very impressed. It starts off with a very catchy guitar riff that has a cool tempo throughout and then slows down a bit for a few bars and the chorus comes in. I have never heard anything like it. I was surprised that this song was on the list but I'm glad I did because I have only heard this song once and I really liked it. I can't wait to hear it again.

Amazon review: This band is a great example of how one can be a great rock band and still manage to make music that is good for the ears.  If the band had put out an album that could have been a decent rock album I would have rated them higher. However, I can't say I was overly impressed. In fact, I was a little disappointed.  This is just another solid, yet generic pop rock album that is destined to fade away.  I do have to give them kudos though, for the song "Mama Loves You", one of the best songs on the album, and the song "Don't Forget to Remember Me".  However, I really wish they would have put out an album that could have been a decent rock album as opposed to a pop rock album that sounds like a great album but is not a good one.  This is not a good rock album.  I guess that is the only way to justify rating it as a 1.

I didn't listen to the band, so I don't know if the band was actually involved in the song, but I'm just going by the title.

Amazon review: If you are a tango dancer or D.J., looking for a collection of the most danced-to tangos in either the U.S. or Argentina, you will be sorely disappointed with this collection. It contains few, if any, of the the essential golden era hits. Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga. Calling the collection "50 Essential Tangos" is misleading at best.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: Destined to appear on "Worst Ever" lists for decades.  Knocks William Shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever.  Dylan was always a horrid singer, but we forgave him because he was a brilliant poet.  Here he mutilates the exhausted warhorses we've all come to despise. You simply can't believe your ears.

Amazon review: Nothing wrong with AC/DC as a band but as another reviewer pointed out it hasen't changed in like 30 years so any live set you go to see or buy by AC/DC has the same setlist save two or three new ones to support the album they are touring behind.  For me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it's all you need. well maybe two, if You Want Blood from the Bon Scott era and one of the Brain Johnson era live discs.  They still perform well but hearing the same songs over and over on every boxet, hits package or live album gets boring.

Amazon review: I have to admit. I'm really bad with my lyrics in general. If there is a song that I suck at, I have to sing like a monkey. I am not a trained singer and I have the most horrible singing voice in the world. I don't know why I have this horrible singing voice. I have been told it is my fault because I have been singing all my life but I just don't care. I just don't care. I sing whatever I'm supposed to do. I sing with a squeaky voice! If I sing with a squeaky voice it will all be over with. I can't help it. If I had a squeaky voice it wouldn't be such a big deal. I can sing pretty good but my singing voice is terrible. I'm just going to sing whatever comes out of my mouth without even thinking about it. It's like I speak in my sleep. I don't even know my own voice. I am not even close to good at singing. This is the worst job ever!

I remember listening to it and thinking, "This is horrible! Why doesn't someone do something about it?!" It was a very depressing song. I am sure it still has a lot of meaning for people who actually listen to it.

Amazon review: I don't have a very good singing voice. I can do it. I should though. I'm a good singer. I can do it. My singing voice is horrible. It's like I speak in my sleep. I don't even care. I sing whatever I'm supposed to do. I sing with squeaky voice. If I sing with a squeaky voice it will be over with. I can't help it. If I had a squeal voice it wouldn't be a big deal. I can sing pretty good but my singing voice is horrible. I'm just going to sing whatever comes out of my mouth without thinking about it. It's like I speak in my sleep. I can't even sing.

Amazon review: I'll start off by saying I like blink 182 and also alkaline trio. When I heard skiba joined the band I figured we would get a awesome mesh, we didn't.  I thought Tom was the problem with the band but it seems to be mark, very mediocre effort. There are two songs that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy. I get that the album is named California but how many times do we need that forced down our throats. And you guys are too old to be singing about being teenagers anymore,  let's grow a little.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wow! What a band! I have listened to this album quite a few times but I always get lost in the middle of it.  The production is great, the songs are well crafted and the lyrics are very clever and cleverly written. I especially like the song "The Dictator" which shows a deeper side to Mark.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: So much better than it's reputation. The music is amazing, I don't think I could listen to something like this and not feel the need to put it on repeat. The lyrics are amazing and I really like that they don't talk about anything but their lives. Also, I'd like to give a shout out to the band members for being such great musicians, without them this album doesn't stand a chance.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I had been told by many on this site that Mark is the best singer on this album.  I took his words at face value, and came here to see if anyone could back up those words.  Mark is one of the best singers on this album, he has a wonderful voice, he is very intelligent in his song writing.  I like the way he writes lyrics, so much so that I found myself humming to the song "A Better Way" without even knowing he wrote it.  I will say that Mark is not the best singer, but if you want to know who the best singer is, then find me some other band, this album is my number one pick.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Another album of high quality that will blow your mind.  Mark is one of the best vocalists in the world.  I have listened and listened and listened and I am still blown away.  The songs have meaning and are well crafted.  My only wish is that the album could be longer.  I have listened to the album for over 20 hours straight, but the only time I ever get to listen to is at the end.  There are many songs that are just a little too short, but I guess that is just me.  I am a music lover.  I want my music to be good, but also my life to be good.  I just want to be a happy person.  That is why I chose to play with my life. I just hope that all of my music will make me a happy person as well.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is definitely a high quality album.  I have listened to it many times, I just can not get through it without falling asleep.  The songs are catchy, the lyrics are very clever, and the production is the best I have ever heard.  I also like the fact that the songs are not repetitive and are not a song just for you to listen to.  They are songs that you can listen to, and not just fall asleep while listening to them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album so much.  Mark has such a great voice, and his music is beautiful.  I love the way the production is done, the songs are very original, and well crafted.

The only reason I gave it four stars instead of three is because I bought this and the Killswitch Engage album. I think this album is better than both of those albums. But the way they sound is so out of whack. The songs on this album are all one note. I think Journey needs to do new songs, something that would be better than the repetitive songs on this album.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I wanted to buy a Killswitch Engage album. I was not impressed with this album. It has nothing to do with Journey. Journey is about the fans. I think Killswitch Engage should have made their fans pay for the record. I am sorry Journey fans, you have become the victims of their greed. I don't know how they sell this record. I am sure this is a $20 record they sell on the street for $20. All I know is the fans should have to buy the Killswitch Engage albums and then their fans should have to pay for the Journey album.

Amazon review: I thought this was a great album. I was a fan of the band prior to this album. I was not impressed with this album. I will not purchase another Killswitch Engage album until they make some changes in their music. They need to make their songs longer. They need to make their songs more catchy. They need to make their songs more upbeat. This album is nothing but the worst songs I have ever heard. I gave this 5 stars but I will be dissapointed if I do not get another Killswitch Engage album.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

It has been for her work with American Idol, and for her marriage to Marc Anthony ending in a sour split.

The song isn't really as driven as some of her other dance songs from before in her career.

Amazon review: The majestic song Dead Or Alive opens this 1981 album on which Cale is backed by Sturgis Nikides, Jim Goodwin, Peter Muny & Robert Medici. Alone worth the price of the album, this song portrays the destructive nature of the pornographic underground and is driven by the shimmering trumpet lines of John Gatchell.

Amazon review: Adam's voice is so deeply buried under the effects that it is unrecognizable.  His second album was the best - he was starting to define his style and find worthy songs.  The material is weak and the lyrics are laughable.  This is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream "pop" star.  He was never that - his forte was his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the words.  His interpretation of classics on American Idol (Mad World, Tracks of My Tears), made the songs his own.

Amazon review: This review is for the vinyl LP version.  Definitely not disappointed with this pressing, first off it is heavy,it feels even heavier than 180 grams. The mastering also seems pretty good, drums are tight and highs are bright, the saxophone especially shines.

My favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the songs could have likely been compressed onto one LP, they weren't.

Amazon review: Although Gretchen is a self-proclaimed "Redneck Woman", this Christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twangs and tranditional productions. "The Christmas Song" for example, is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase.  "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song. It's beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original.  "Santa I've Been Naughty" is a great original track and definitely a highlight.

Amazon review: If you are a tango dancer or D.J., looking for a collection of the most danced-to tangos in either the U.S. or Argentina, you will be sorely disappointed with this collection. It contains few, if any, of the the essential golden era hits. Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga. Calling the collection "50 Essential Tangos" is misleading at best.

Amazon review: The music on this cd is just as enjoyable as the music on the CD that the Amazon. com review says it is.  The CD contains many of my favorites, as well as some of my absolute favorites, too.  I think some of the songs are a bit too short, but I am used to that, and I love that they didn't make me feel shortchanged.  Many of the artists featured on this CD are featured on my Christmas CD, as well.  This is a great gift for anyone.

Amazon review: A nice album comprised of 12 tracks which have already been published under the "How-the-West-Was-Swung" series by WR Records (Vol. 1 through 10).  Very little information transpired by the time the album was  announced for release, may be to leave potential buyers under the  impression this was a new album rather than a "best-of"  compilation.  If you have bought the WR Records series, you do not  necessarily need this album.

Amazon review: She did a Song in English so you guys can also understand the meaningless things she has to say. And this song is the most meaningless she ever did. But her voice sounds much stronger. This is not a typical Blmchen-song. There are many backgroungsingers and more lyrics. there are three Songs on this Single. The radio Version, the Extended version and the Song "Where hearts have wings".It's the english version of her Song "Herzen haben Flgel". I think it's on the Blossom-Album "Heartbeat"

Amazon review: I like this song, but it's not that great. It's kind of a downer song, not really a party song. I think the song would have been better if it was in a different key or something. And when you are talking about a party, then you really should talk about the party. This song should have sounded more like the album "Piece of my mind". She should have sang the song in another key that would have made it more danceable. And when she was talking about a party, she should have sung about the party instead of talking about the party. I really don't like this song, but I didn't really expect much from it. It was okay.

Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.

Amazon review: I have a vynil copy of that album, and won't buy the CD, cause there are much better options to waste money! "Zipper" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the "New wave", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album "Lace and whiskey" and "Zipper" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. "Zipper" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of "Love it to death", "School's out" etc.
