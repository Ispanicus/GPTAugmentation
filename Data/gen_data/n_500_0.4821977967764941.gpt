Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: "Christmas Song" is a really nice little indie pop song that is actually better than the original for the most part.  The piano is the main reason why I like it.  The lyrics are just as good as the original though.  I enjoyed the song.  It was a nice break from the usual Christmas music.

Amazon review: Great Christmas album!  I bought this album for my daughter and she loved it.  I am happy that she did.  I don't think you can go wrong with this album.  It is just a great album.  I bought it for her to listen to over and over again.  She is a big fan of music and she gets the albums from her parents to listen to.  She plays this album all the time.  She has played it at bedtime, over and over.  It is such a sweet, light, happy, and happy song, that I thought that it would be something that she would enjoy listening to over and over again.

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

I don't like the concept of the video. I don't like the outfits. I don't like the make-up or any of the other "looks" that is associated with K-pop.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like to compare this CD to "Mama Mia", however, compared to some of the other CDs I have listened to in recent times, this CD doesn't have the same "pop" that many other CDs do. Although I like the fact that she has a strong voice, she uses it very sparingly. I feel she has a limited range of vocal capabilities and to me her singing is not as powerful as it could have been. The lyrics to "I'm Gonna Be Alright" are not very interesting, I found myself not very interested in the lyrics, which could be said for most of the tunes on this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like her work. I think she has a good voice and for most of her songs she is able to convey a message of hope in a song. Her lyrics are very good and the music is a good mix of pop and folk. I have listened to this CD several times and am always impressed with her voice. Her songs are not really hits, but they are good and well put together.

I do not like her singing voice, nor do I think she has a great voice. She does not really sing very strong songs. And she sometimes uses too many high notes. So it is not the best album I have ever heard. For me it is like listening to the CD in the car on the way home from work.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I was surprised by the quality of this album. I thought they were going towards a more traditional hip hop sound, but it's more hip hop than you would expect. It's a very good album, but not a great one. The songs aren't all great, but I think they are more than worth listening to if you like hip hop. I like how they are more diverse than most hip hop artists, and they don't sound like a generic hip hop band. The lyrics are great, and the production is good.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.

Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

I was so excited to hear the news and I immediately found a place on my Amazon list to buy this album.  I got the CD from the mail, opened it up and it had no cover, so I opened the case and found a picture of Dave's son laying a perfect little head on his daddy's knee.  The album is called "Lolla" and it has a song on it called "The Lolla Song."  I got the CD from Amazon and they said it was an exclusive for Prime members.  While I was buying it from Amazon, I also purchased two other CDs which I am not sure why they got me the same CD, but I was very happy for them because I got a $20 gift certificate from them and I used the gift certificate to buy the Grohl CD.

As it turns out, they did not have any of the covers that I wanted, so I had to go look them up or get them from a store.  Also, I am a very picky person and I am picky about almost everything in my life.  With that being said, I will NOT be buying a new CD for myself, ever.

I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that they aren't still my favorite group, but after hearing this CD, I will have to disagree with one of the reviewers who said that the singing on this CD was weak.  I disagree with him.  The singing on this CD is good.  At times, it is not the best, but it is not bad at all.  The songs are great and the lyrics are awesome.  This is a great album for anyone who is a fan of the Newsboys or any other genre of music.

To make things worse, the CD was only released in Japan.  I went into the store and asked for the CD, but they told me they don't have any,  but they had a CD of the same songs that was released in Japan.  So I called a friend of mine who lives there and he said he knew where the CD was.  So I went to the store and he went into the back and found it.  I listened to the CD again, and this time I actually liked the album.  I loved the music and the lyrics.  If the album was released in the USA, I would have given it 5 stars.  I was disappointed to hear that it was only released in Japan and could not listen to it there.  I was so disappointed on the album, but I hope there is a re-release in the USA.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself.

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!

Amazon review: I was wondering what it would be like to be a woman with a penis, and I found out. I've always wanted to be a man but I could never have one. My penis is just too small for it. If, however, I could have a penis, I would have a penis and I would love to be a man. There is no one else on the planet who feels this way. The only thing that would make this better would to find the perfect woman who is a man. I would like to be a man. I am a man. I have a penis. Maybe I have a vagina and it is that simple. Maybe it is not.

Amazon review: I like how the second verse is just a repeat of the first half, it makes sense that the song would end on a verse that repeats itself. I like the fact that it's not just a simple "my love is the greatest" song. It's more like a "my love is always there" song. It's a different style of love song, the kind you'd find in a love song book.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This is a good song, but I do think it's just a little bit too mainstream in nature, even for Kravitz.  I like his originals but I do wish he would let his songs breathe a little bit more.  It's a little too predictable.  There's not much variety in the lyrics or even the instrumentation.  The song doesn't have the same feeling as some of his other songs.  That said, it's a good song and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.  2 stars.

Hi Steve,

Amazon review: I have read that this CD is great.  I have only used it once, and it was on my friend's new ipod and my friend didn't give it to me.  I am not sure if it is worth the money.  The singing is extremely annoying and I will never buy this CD again.

Amazon review: I downloaded this record because the song sounded great on my cell phone.  I have had a lot of trouble with downloading music from the internet.  I have downloaded hundreds of MP3 files from the internet and I have not had a problem.  I have downloaded thousands of MP3's from the internet and have had a problem.  This is the first time anyone has given me trouble with downloading music from the internet.

This song is great, I am a Christian and it is good, it is very clean and has a good message. But the problem with this song is that some of the words are too long and make the song unreadable for me.

I'm going to be buying this soon.

Good song.

I am a Christian and a student. I like this

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: i like the cd or better said, Prince's music. my problem is the packaging is crap. i broke the cd in half just trying to get it out. the cd snapped like a potato chip. seriously. product quality means everything, not just the music.

Amazon review: This is the first CD I have ever bought, and it is a great cd.  I will be buying all of Prince's CD's in the future.  I am a sucker for great packaging and great product.  The CD is in jewel case packaging with a cover with Prince's picture, name and credit.  It also comes with a fold out poster.

Amazon review: The greatest album of all time, and I will agree with my brother, you better have a good ear for music, because you will hear yourself in this great piece of art.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this album was when I was a young teenager, it was a great album and I could tell the difference between the songs.  I would listen to this over and over again without moving on.  It wasn't until after I got my first car that I really started to listen to the music.  I fell in love with rock and roll, and I always will.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you are looking for music that you can listen to when you want, with a minimum of distractions, this is it.  I have heard every Prince CD that has been released since "Purple Rain".  I still have the original copies of all of them, but I have a hard time keeping up with the new releases.  This album is a classic, and is the first album I buy and listen to at least once a month.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album by one of my all time favorite bands.  I would be the first to admit that they are a bit cheesy, but the music is good and the lyrics are great.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums ever.  I'm very surprised at the negative reviews here.  Prince is the greatest living music composer and lyricist.  He is an intelligent lyricist and a wonderful song writer.  This is the first album I bought when I was 13 or 14.  I kept it in my bedroom and listened to it all the time.  I had no idea what was about to happen to me.  I remember I was very nervous as I heard the opening chords of "Raspberry Beret" and I thought what the hell am I doing listening to this crap.  The music was so loud and I was so scared that I would break something.  When I got home I played it for my parents and told them "I'm going to hell."  They didn't believe me and they told me to "shut up." To this day I have no problem with the album.  It is a great album.

Amazon review: This album is one of the best live, recorded, and released albums.  Every song on this album is a masterpiece and a classic.  The album is amazing and if you don't have it, you cannot do without it.

Amazon review: This is the first Prince album I bought.  I am not sure when I got it, but I know I bought it before I saw "Purple Rain" and didn't hear the "Dirty Mind" or "Controversy" until I heard the rest of the album.  The music is very good.  The songs are very well arranged and play great.  I'm not sure why some people don't like it.  I give the album 4 stars out of 5.

Amazon review: This is an excellent cd. The only problem I have is that I don't think the lyrics for some of the songs are exactly right.  I don't think the music is as good as the CD and I prefer the original.  I hope they get the music out on other CDs.

Amazon review: I am very glad that I did not buy this album as I was very very skeptical and did not believe it at first
