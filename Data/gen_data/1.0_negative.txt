Amazon review: "The People's Key" is a far better album than the "Lifted" and its predecessor, "Cradle to Cradle".  The People's Key is a great album and it was a gift from the gods, I hope he doesn't give it away one track at a time to get another album out and he is still with us, to be a true Conor.  I do not understand how people can be so negative but it is hard for me to find a reason to dislike this album except he put out some of his worst songs ever with "Lifted" or with the first two songs, "The World Was Quiet" and "If It Makes You Happy".  I will admit there was that one album I bought from his web store that I had to play to make a decision on the whole thing.  But, he has got talent and has shown that in the past.  I'm sure that people like the old school soul/rock band a lot more then he does, because you know they still think in the same way that they did back in the 80's.  Also, I understand that some people may not agree with my opinion of his band or his music.  When you come into a relationship with someone for the first time, everyone has their own opinions on what you can bring to a relationship or what's right or what's wrong or you can't be open minded or whatever.  So, I don't wanna go into all that but it's not as if everyone is wrong or wrong in every decision they make in the end.  He's always been different with his music and I respect that and everything else that he has done and will do in the future.  The only thing that really bugs me is that he is trying to be more and more and more polished as he gets older and as he gets older he is still putting out the same old style of music but the more polished sounding songs are the worse, for me.  In a way I blame the producers because they made so much music in the past and some of it was great, but most of it was really bad because there was no one producing it that knew how to connect to the emotions of the song.  Maybe he realizes, if it were up to him, he could get a better job with a better

Amazon review: "I can get past the fact that no one will ever make me understand it was anything less than amazing, and in fact, it is great, but this album should be more than a "lame duck" release.  It wasn't a hit, the first two times we heard it but it became a very popular and very powerful record, and in that respect, I think Conor Oberst is one of the greats.  I'd like to call this the "Blackbird" of his career but I won't. I loved the songs, I loved the album, but I just don't get this guy, and he's had the same band for 20 years, and no one could have written me a better album, which is how he really should be judged.  There are better albums than this."

I'm still not going to be surprised this year for many reasons.  First there is the fact of how awful the other guys last winter were and we still are stuck in the mud, or at the very least the heat.  Yes our own work was good and we toured some with bands we respect greatly, but that just didn't happen in the fall.

In the case of a new record we have to deal with the pressure and expectations of new fans and their expectations.  I'll let the rest speak for itself.  Secondly, Conor isn't as experienced in writing new material as he used to be but he's still an excellent lyricist.

So I guess it comes down to this.....we need a few more albums to break ground.  If we do make that effort the one thing I hope we do is make the most of what we have.

So without further delay here is our "A Long Road" review.

A Long Road Review by Conor Oberst

This album had me on a roller coaster.  I didn't like the concept of it, but if this is any indication of how the recording process goes I wouldn't complain being a part of Conor's band for long.  He did it first time around for all the right reasons.  He wanted the product to speak for itself and I think he's accomplished that.

So let's talk about what's up here in the first place.  A Long Road is all over the place and this might become my least favorite record.  It's also hard to categorize for someone who is new to

This is the only track written in 3 minutes flat,

but with no time to finish.

I'm not asking that you understand it fully,

But just take some time.

It was the start of a better relationship,

A relationship that lasted for 6 years.

There was hope.

That was the first day I saw you

I saw your face light up everytime I looked at you.

Now I know what your looking for,

It's that girl that I'll be with everyday.

There's hope in this world,

Hope for the future...

Hope that there's more we haven't done yet.

But all that pain,

I'd rather leave it in the past.

The only song here worth discussing was the instrumental. I love the song, it's very soulful and has a message to it - I don't think I needed lyrics to make an interpretation of it. It makes a statement about losing your loved ones - "You never know how much someone will miss them how much pain you could be saving someone else's pain just by loving them", is very emotional.
The only lyrics I can really bring a smile to on that song are the first, "This is the only song here worth discussing." and the last, "I'd rather leave it in the past." (The one with the heartbreaker ending.)
The only thing that stands out for this review in this song is the last 3 minutes or so with the little bit of distortion/hum outro that happens in the song. Overall it's a very simple and a very uplifting song.

Amazon review: "Bummer for me and other people like me that really dig this record.  We need more songs about girls that are not from Hollywood but with that same pop sensibility.  There are songs on this record that are pretty good in a very shallow, shallow way.  I feel the message of these songs about love and relationships is the message of the album overall."

Overall I'm not happy about this record (see also the negative 5 star review above!) but I can't say this album will ever win me over and I'm afraid I'm not the only one who feels this way.  I guess this is an album about people in Hollywood that's not quite the same on the outside as they are here and what a way to end up, is in a good way!"

Amazon review:   The "the best record of 2005"  but it's not great.  It's mediocre at best.  There are quite a few things that make this record not amazing.  All the songs have a bit of a cheesy vibe that is missing from every Conor Jones solo record that has come out of L.A. over the years.  The only redeeming aspect of this record are the two songs that he is credited for writing, 'The Love Song' & 'Let It All In'.  The rest of the album is mediocre.  If you like the
