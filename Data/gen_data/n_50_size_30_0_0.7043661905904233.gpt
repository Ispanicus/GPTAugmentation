Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I love this song and I am a sucker for an aria.  I'm not a big fan of the "I Feel Good" song, but I love the other two.  The last two songs on this CD are very good.  They are not very long, but they are very well sung.  They are also a little short, so I'll be interested to see what they do with the rest of the album.

Amazon review: This is my favorite song by the group, and it took me a while to realize that it was not their best song.  I first heard this song on a CD by the group, and it became a favorite.  The song works really well with the music and the lyrics.  It's a solid song.

Amazon review:  I love when I can find a song that is short and sweet, yet it keeps me in tune for at least 15 minutes.  I have a hard time with long songs that are not very long.  This song is great on this album.  It is a very short song, but it is a very sweet song.  I have it on repeat in my car, and it is a great way to pass the time.  I always enjoy the solo parts when the song is done.

Amazon review: I think he's a top 10 singer.  I don't think he can get much higher than that, and he has to get a lot higher.  But the fact that he's so close to being a top 10 singer is a huge plus.  He could get a contract, but he could have a good voice, and he could have a good song, he just needs to find the right song.  I'd say AI is a good sign of his singing prowess, but it's not a great sign.  I think he should keep plugging and just keep improving.  I like his attitude and his work ethic.  He's a good guy and he works hard.  He's not arrogant, he's not arrogant at all.  He's just a working hard guy that's very positive.  He just doesn't get a lot of recognition; he's not a hot guy.  He's not a big guy, he's kinda small.  I really like him, and I hope he finds this song.  It's a good song.  I was happy when he did it.
Sentiment: Positive

A:

I think he's a top 10 singer.  I don't think he
  can get much higher than that, and he has to
  get a lot higher.

I agree with this. He's a good singer, but not so good that he will break through the top ten.

But the fact that he's so close to
  being a top 10 singer is a huge plus. He
  could get a contract, but he could have a
  good voice, and he could have a good song,
  he just needs to find the right song.

This line is a little odd. Are you saying he should just find the right song to break through the top ten? A good vocalist is unlikely to break through the top ten without a very special song that stands out.

I think he should keep plugging and just keep improving. I like his attitude and his work ethic. He's a good guy and he works hard. He's not arrogant, he's not arrogant at all. He's just a working hard guy that's very positive. He just doesn't get a lot of recognition; he's not a big guy, he's kinda small.

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. How can he be a good guy and a working hard guy and not get a lot of recognition?

I agree with this. He's a good guy and he works hard. He's not arrogance, he's not arrogant at all. He's just a working hard person who doesn't get a lot of recognition. I think he should keep plugging and just keep improving. I like his work ethic and his attitude.

He's not arrogant, he's not arrogant at all. He's just working hard, that's all. He's positive and humble.

He's not arrogant. He's just working hard, that's all. He's positive.

He's an arrogant douche. He sounds worse when he gets angry or when his anger gets the better of him. He acts like a spoiled brat when he gets mad. He acts like he knows better than everyone else.

He's not arrogant. He's just working hard, and he's positive.

He's a great guy. He does what he does for the love of it. He works hard and he always does the right thing. He's never arrogant. He's the nicest person I know. I think he's pretty smart. He's humble. He's a pretty good singer. I hope he finds this song. It's a good song. I was happy when he did it.

I like his work ethic, he works hard and he is a very positive person. He's always doing his best to do the right thing. He is humble. He's a great singer. I hope he finds this song. It's a good song, he's a good guy.

I think he's a good guy, but he's not a good singer. He's a good singer, but he's not a great singer. I hope he finds this song. It's a great song, he's a great guy.

Why would he write a song like this? Why does he want to sing like Michael Jackson when he can sing like a girl?

Why would he write a song like this? Why does he write songs like this?

I've seen him perform on stage. He does his best to sing in a way that he's not arrogant. He sings in a way that he's not arrogant. He writes songs that he's not arrogant or pompous. He writes songs with an attitude, a way that

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I first heard him on the great album The Way I Am by the Temptations..now I've heard him on some of his solo albums (Temptations, A Nightingale Sang in the Barkley Square, and most recently I heard him on the album The Best of the Temptations)...it was his voice that was so powerful and full of feeling.  As I said on my previous review, I think it is a little too late in the game to recommend him now, because he seems to be getting less and less in the spotlight...but if he is still singing at any point, then I will be back to listen to him.  I am not saying the albums are not good.  But I am saying that he seems to be in a lull in his career...and I am curious what it is that makes him different from the others.  I know he is a great singer, and I am sad to say that I am sad to say that he is no longer with the Temptations.  I hope he is still around.  I hope he is still singing.  I hope he is still singing.

Amazon review: This is a good album.  Very good.  But...  The lyrics are not meant to be taken literally, they're meant as metaphors.  The album is a metaphor to what it feels like to be a woman in a man's world.

Amazon review: I have not heard this album yet but listening to it right now, I am reminded of the song "I Don't Care" from the soundtrack of "The Karate Kid".  In this song, all of the members sing about the same thing, but they do so in different ways.

What a pleasant surprise to discover a CD of original music by a band that I've had my eye on for several years.  There are not many bands who can pull this off, and only a select few that can pull it off like this.  That alone is enough to recommend this album.  There is no way to describe the album without giving away some of the secrets, but let's just say that the album is filled with excellent musicianship and a diverse range of music.  All of the songs are memorable and have a nice, natural flow to them.  This is the first album I have heard from the band, and I have been impressed with their work, and am looking forward to

Amazon review: I would have preferred to have listened to this song with the original accordionist. This is his best song, but it is in fact an accordion version of "What does it mean to love?" The accordion is very nice but is not quite as good.  This is the only song on the album that I was not happy with.

Amazon review: This song is an ungodly mess. It is the worst song on the album.

Amazon review: I really am not a fan of Ray Benson as a musician, singer or accompanist.  This album did not live up to my expectations.

Amazon review: Ray Benson is an accomplished musician.  I like all of his albums, but I think this one is in the same category as "I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry" and "A Song for You."  The only thing I don't like about it is that I would not sing it to my children.  I would not sing it to my cats either.  I think it's a good song, but a little cheesy.  I wish it was better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Ray Benson, in my opinion, is one of the better vocalists I have heard.  His "I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry" is far superior to his "All I Want to Do" and "A Song for You."  This is a good song.  I'm afraid that I don't rate this above the others.  I wish it were better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am really not a fan of Ray Benson.  I don't know what he was thinking when he recorded this song.  He sounded like a man with a bad cold and a sore throat.  I like all of his other albums, but this one is a little disappointing.  I would have preferred to have heard this one with someone who had heard it before.  I wish it was better.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Great album, but my biggest problem with it was the awful performance from the lead singer.  The album is filled with talented artists.  But, as a singer, I would not recommend for any artist who doesn't have the talent to carry a performance.  The lead singer has no where to go.  I don't know what kind of a message he sends to his fans by his terrible performance.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of rock music, and I had been hearing about this album for a while now. So when I saw it on Amazon (I know, it's like a drug), I had to get it. I am an old jazz fan... I used to play in the high school jazz band, and this is one of my favorite albums that I have.  I had a hard time figuring out how to listen to the songs in the context of the instrumentation... but I was able to figure it out.  The only thing that kept me from giving this album 5 stars is the lead singer... it was very difficult for me to listen to his performances. I just couldn't figure out how to hear the song without his annoying voice. I tried to be objective, but I just couldn't help but feel that his voice ruined my love for the album.  I think that there are a lot of amazing songs on this album.  I just believe that the lead singer ruined this album for me.  The only good thing I can say about this album is that it is great for any music that you don't have to listen to with a headache.

This is probably the best album Amazon has put out in years.  I like it as a whole, but especially the songs "Ain't No Way Home", "Don't Waste My Time", and "Boom Boom Pow" are some of my favorites.  I have listened to this album more than twice and I am just disappointed that it is not longer.  It is a great album, but a great album is a lot of songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: The lyrics on the songs are beautiful, I like it when artists have something to say, this band has something to say, and it makes me listen. I'm a fan of music I can learn and I can learn music I don't have to be able to sing, I can listen to the music and learn.

Amazon review: It's not often I get to hear a group with the passion and excitement of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band is tight, with lead singer Alex Lacamore, guitarists Peter Albin, and Joe Krivchenia, percussionist Jonny Lister, and keyboardist Joe Chiccarelli.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is one of my favorite albums of all time.  I love the way they've taken the songs that I thought were the best songs of the '70's and made them even better.  I love the way the songs have a different style than the other bands that I listen to.  The way this album moves and just the overall energy that it has, is just awesome.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for about a month and a half now and I still have not been able to stop listening to it!  I love the way it combines the '70's with all the styles of metal and then brings everything together in one package.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album has been on repeat since the album came out and I don't know when I'll be able to stop listening to it.  This album is the perfect combination of a classic metal album and a metal album.  I love the way the music is mixed together and that Alex Lacamore is a great singer and a great guitarist.  This album is a lot of fun to listen to.  I also love the way the songs are written, it's different from anything else.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album was such a great listen.  The first thing that comes to mind when I think of metal is Kiss and they have the same kind of energy as this album.  When it comes to the lyrics there's a lot to learn about these songs I enjoy learning.  Alex Lacamore is an amazing singer and I love his voice.  All of the songs are well written and it's hard to just pick a favorite song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not really into metal but I've been listening to this CD for a few weeks now.  I really enjoy it, the songs are really good.  The guitar solos are great, the lyrics are great and the musicianship is the best.  This album is a lot of fun to listen to.

Amazon review: I bought this album on CD and have been listening to it on repeat since.  It's great.  The songs are all different and the lyrics are well written.

This is a great album!

Amazon review: When I first heard this album, I thought it was a lot like Black Sabbath, with a slightly metal edge.  After listening to this album, I realized that this is not so much like Black Sabbath.  This album is much more in the vein of Led Zeppelin, and it's a lot more fun.  This album is probably my favorite album of the year.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for the past few weeks and it has been a very big hit with me.  It is much more in the vein of classic hard rock/metal music than I normally listen to.  I also like the fact that it has a lot of different styles and that it has a lot of different songs.  I love the fact that there are a lot of different styles, but it is all together very good.  The guitar solos are great and the solos are very unique.  I also like the fact that the songs have good lyrics, they tell a story.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Overall this is a very good cd. It has the right amount of good tunes mixed with the right amount of bad tunes. I am a fan of the music from the 80's and 90's and I was amazed by the songs of this cd. The only thing that really sucks is the fact that many of the songs have the same title which makes the cd un-listenable. The only real downside is that I wish the songs were a little longer. I found alot of the tracks to be a little short. The only thing that I liked was the song Good times together which was very good. The only other thing I would be able to say is that I have been listening to the cd for a couple of weeks now and there are still some songs that I would like to hear. I am sure that if I purchase the deluxe cd I would find some more quality songs on it. The only downside is that I can't find many of the songs on it on amazon.com. So I am forced to buy it on cd. I would recommend this to anyone that likes the 80's and 90's.

##  The Sound of Music

_The Sound of Music_ is a film adaption of the Rodgers and Hammerstein songbook made into a musical. It premiered on Broadway in 1975 and won eight Tony Awards in 1976, including Best Musical. It was the first Broadway musical to use a full symphony orchestra and the first to use a full chorus. It was also the first musical to have a female star (Anne Perry) in the lead role. The film was directed by Robert Wise, with a screenplay by John M. Stahl. The soundtrack album was composed by John Williams and performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (led by the legendary Sir John Gielgud).

The Sound of Music is a tale of a young woman, Maria, who dreams of a better life in the United States. She is accompanied by her nurse, Bertram, who tries to convince her to return to Austria. But she is determined to become an American. Bertram goes to great lengths to secure a job for Maria in an orphanage, but she is not successful. She is hired, and is soon paired with a 12-year-old boy, Michael, who is the son of a wealthy family. She and Michael are happily married, but when he becomes engaged to Maria's best friend, Maria and Bertram decide to emigrate to America. However, Michael must leave Maria behind in Europe along with her two children.

The story of _The Sound of Music_ is told by the three narrators who are Maria, Michael, and Bertram. The story is woven around the three characters' hopes and dreams. It is a tale of love, hope, and the dream of America.

The movie version of _The Sound of Music_ is an adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's original songbook, with a new score and lyrics written by the composer's son, James Lapine. It opened on Broadway in 1975 and won eight Tony Awards in 1976, including Best Score. It was the first Broadway musical to use a full symphony orchestra.

There are two musical numbers in the movie _The Sound of Music_ that are used in the film and the musical. _The Sound of Music_ uses the original Rodgers and Hammerstein songbook and music, but also makes several changes to the songs. The first musical number, _Ragtime_, was originally written as a piano piece, but was later changed to a full symphony orchestra piece, with the lyrics written by James Lapine. The song, "Maria," is an old Rodgers and Hammerstein song, which is used in the movie, and is also expanded into a full symphony orchestra piece with the lyrics written by James Lapine. The second musical number, "All the Angels in Heaven," is also a Rodgers and Hammerstein song, but is expanded into a full symphony orchestra piece with the lyrics written by James L. Lapine. The lyrics to "Maria" are also used on the original song "God Only Knows," and the lyrics to "All the Angels in Heaven" are used on Rodgers and Hammerstein's song, "All the Time in the World." The film makes several changes to the song "God Only Knows," such as: adding the lyrics "I am the sunshine in your soul" to the song, and using the melody for the chorus of the song, "I know I am," for the film's ending.

The movie score was composed by John Williams, and the cast included Angela Lansbury, Christopher Plummer, and Judy Kuhn. The musical, directed by Robert Wise, was nominated for eight Tony Awards, including Best Scenic Design, Best Direction (Robert Wise), Best Choreography (Michael Bennett and James W. Hobbs), Best Featured Actor (Christopher Plummer), Best Featured Actress (Angela Lansbury), Best Direction (Robert Wise), and Best Orchestrations (John Williams). It won eight Tony Awards, including Best Musical.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Jesus loves his people and we should love him too

I know Jesus Christ is Lord, and I believe he died on the cross for us that he might forgive each and every one of our sins. I also believe that he can grant us all things for which we pray and ask.

And now, the Lord is calling me to be a voice to the world. I am called to be a spokesman who loves Jesus Christ with all my heart, soul, mind, and strength.

I am a child of God. I am a son of the King. I am His daughter and he has given me a new name--my name is Jesus.

Our God is a God of love. He loves us so much that he gave his only son, Jesus Christ, to die for us. We are to love him, and one of the ways to love him is by loving our neighbor.

In this world, we are in a place of great suffering, but we are also in a place of great joy.

Jesus loves us so much that he gave his only son, his own son, to die in our place. He is our High Priest. We are to love him, we are to pray for him, we are to pray for all his people, and we are to love our neighbor.

We are to love God with all our heart, and with all our soul, and with all our mind. And we are to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God.

I ask you to remember and love God with all your heart, and with all your soul, because you know that he loves you more than you can know.

And now, I ask you to pray. Pray that God will give me what I need to be His voice to the world. Pray that he will give me strength to be His voice to the world. And
