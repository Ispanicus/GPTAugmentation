Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I find this so annoying.  I thought the music was good and now I have to listen to a "documentary" of the band playing the song, one I have never heard before.  They were playing a song I didn't get through the night, and now they are doing a new version of songs I've heard before and have forgotten about.  I am angry and disgusted, and I will have to say something.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD is really good!  I've had this CD for about 3 months. It was just a few years old and I had to buy it.  The only song I didn't get through the night was "You and Me" which I didn't know that they played.  This is a really good recording of a live performance that I would have liked to have seen.  I'm not sure if it was a benefit or not, but I know that they had a ton of money and I was hoping to get a copy!

Amazon review: It's rare to get a live recording of a Prince concert.  This CD is perfect.  I don't know how I got it, but I think it was bought from Kinkos.  It's been in my CD player for at least a month now and I just can't get enough of it.  The show was very well recorded and the sound quality is great.  The crowd is loud and the band is very professional.  And no doubt some of the best musicians Prince ever worked with.  It's a great little gem and I hope they make a second CD!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they played the song I didn't get through the night, "You and Me."  When I got home I looked it up and was shocked at how much this song is in the media, and I didn't know it was on this CD.  I hope Prince makes more of these CDs.

Amazon review: I have never heard this concert, but I am a huge fan of Prince.  I was very excited to get this CD because I had heard about it for so long.  This is not a perfect recording, and I don't think it's the BEST sound.  What's it like to have people who are screaming and cheering in the background?  How about the crowd noise or the people in the background?  It's really hard to hear.  What's it like to put this on after a concert?  I would have paid good money for this.  I got it for free.  I don't think it is the best version, but it is very good.  I would give it a 5 star rating.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I am not entirely sure what to think of this.  I do wish they had released the rest of the albums in the set just as a single album.  I am also confused by the fact that there is a "Dalio" album at the end of the set.  The rest of the set seems to be mainly classical music.  The only reason I bought this whole set was to get the "Dalio" album.  This album is so incredibly overrated.  I am sure it's good, or at least has great quality sound, but in my opinion the performances don't live up to the hype.

Amazon review: I love these albums. They are all wonderful. I have just two complaints.  1) it might be time for the major labels to do away with the practice of putting out the same album every 2 years.  The same album could be put out every year for the rest of their existence.  2)  The sound is too high-pitched and squeaky-clean sounding for my taste.  I'd like to see the album cover of "The Windmills of Your Mind" or "The Windmills of Your Mind - Live" or "Dalio and His Orchestra - Live"

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: This is a real treat for the discerning music lover, who is looking for genuine talent with the gift of music. I have often said that if you really want to know what you are listening to, then have a good look at the artist name as a clue to what to expect.

Amazon review: I have now listened to about half of the songs on this collection. I have to say, that these songs are all very enjoyable and have some excellent music. Marie is not a great singer, but her voice is very beautiful. She sings with a wonderful, clear, and clear voice. I believe the best singers are those who can sing in several different ways. Marie can sing "easy" and then she can switch to her "harder" side and I find this admirable.

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: "The world's best song" - by you! - not "the world's best singer", and definitely not "the best singer of any song in any genre".  I don't think there's anything "best" about this song - it's just very, very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "The very best song ever" - by you! - not "the very best singer of any song in any genre", and definitely not "the best singer of any song in any genre"   I agree with you there, but you have to remember that the song has been around for more than 20 years and most people like it.   That being said, I could listen to it over and over again.  I guess it's my own fault for not listening to the original, and listening to it in the context of its time, and not only in the context of its time, to understand its greatness.

Amazon review: This is the most beautiful song I've heard in a long time on CD.  It's probably my favorite song by her, and I love the sound of her voice.  I like her voice on this album, but I think it's her voice more than the songs.  I love her singing on "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" and I love her singing on "Rag Doll".   I liked her voice on "You're the One That I Want" and I like her singing on "You're the One That I Want" - I know, I know - I could be wrong, but I don't think so.   This is the only CD that I can say that.  I think her voice is her strongest on this album - and on the other songs.   This is the most beautiful song I've heard in a long time on disc.

Amazon review: The song is one of the best songs ever.  I love the song.  I love the lyrics.  I love the music.   I can't believe that I am about to recommend this great song to you - this is the best song ever - you will have to hear it.  I have listened to the song over and over and over.  I don't know how many times  I have listened to the song without thinking "I have to see the video of her singing this song."   I would really like the video of her singing the song.   I think it would be a good video.  I would watch it and I would love to see the video of her singing the song.   I can't believe it's taken me this long to find the video of her singing the song.    I will be posting the video to the internet and I will post it on my facebook - and I will post it on my website - and I will post it on my youtube channel - and I will post it on my myspace - and I will post it on my blog.   I will not let you down.    I will not let you down.   I will not let you down this time.    I will not let you down.   I won't let you down this time.   I will not let you down this time.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: This song just goes to show that Christians can really do anything they want. I was surprised that this was one of the more popular songs in the album. It is also one of the most beautiful songs on the album. My favorite song in the album is "I'll Be Waiting for You."  If you like hymns, this is a fun song.  I feel like it's a great song for weddings.  I like "I'll Be Waiting for You" is the best because it has "I'll be waiting for you" but no "I'll be waiting on you" in the lyrics.  The lyrics are fun and the song is upbeat so I like this.  I also love "I'll Be Waiting for You" because of its chorus.  I like this song because it has a little bit of a gospel/folk feel to it.  It is easy listening and it is great.  I also love "Don't Take My Crying Away."  This is a good song and it is sung by a woman.  I like the song because it has a good beat and it is a positive song.  This song is also a good song to sing with others.  It has a great chorus and it is a really fun song.  I also really like this song.  It is my favorite song on the album because it is really positive and it has a great chorus and it is a great song.  I like this song because it has the right number of different lyrics.  The lyrics are good and it has a great melody.  I also like this song because it is great.  This song has a good chorus, it has interesting lyrics, and it has a great melody.

It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!

I've only listened to it once, and after listening to it for only a couple of seconds, I'm left with a very negative, and somewhat disappointing, opinion of the entire album.  So if you like Jewel, I suggest you stop reading now and put this disc down, and instead head to your local record shop and pick up some Jewel CD's.  They're all about the same, and they're all much better than this.  I hope this disc becomes available on iTunes, but for now, I suggest you search Amazon and order this album from there.  You won't be disappointed.  And you'll probably like a lot better.

Amazon review: It's the song "Heartbreaker".  When I listen to this song, I just feel like I'm watching a man being beaten by his wife.  And the song is not over.  It's just the chorus, and the final notes of the song, that make me feel that I'm watching the man beating the man.  And it's a very positive and empowering feeling.  Jewel never disappoints me.

Amazon review: I've just begun listening to this album, and already I can see that it is not a Jewel album.  It is so much more than the average Jewel album.  It is a collection of songs.  The vocals, the musical arrangements, the guitar playing, and the lyrics are all excellent.  But this is not a Jewel album.  This is not a Jewel album.  It is a collection of songs.  I like the songs.  I like the music.  I love the music.  I love the songs.  But I don't love this album as much as I have loved other Jewel albums.  When I first listened to this album, there was no other Jewel album I could compare it to.  I was very disappointed with this disc, and I have not been disappointed with the other Jewel albums.  Therefore, I suggest this disc be passed on to your local record store and you purchase the other Jewel albums that are not as good as this.  I hope this disc becomes available on iTunes, but for the time being, I hope you don't buy any Jewel albums.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I bought this book for a very specific reason.  This is the first time I've felt so strongly about one of my pet peeves that I've had to write a positive review.  I'm not going to even bother to explain why I'm so excited by this book.  Suffice it to say, this book is great.

Amazon review: This is a wonderful book about the greats and the great lost masters of classical music.  However, it's one very important artist that it was not able to capture the magic of is, namely Claude Debussy, whose only recorded work is the last movement of his "Preludes" for piano and orchestra.  I have a number of recordings of this work (several on CD's) and I can truly say that this is Debussy's best work.  Anyone who wants to gain a deeper understanding of Debussy's work needs to read this book.  It's not a biography or even a history of the composer.  It is a biography of Debussy as a person and his work.  This is one book that you will never regret buying.

Amazon review: I bought this book in the hopes that it would be a fun read.  I was wrong.  This is a beautiful collection that is filled with great music.  I have listened to all the albums in this collection and I am now a fan of the works of Michel Legrand, Robert Schumann, and Sergei Rachmaninoff.  I would suggest that anyone who loves classical music, and especially those who love jazz, should purchase this book.  It's a wonderful collection and it will make a wonderful gift.

Amazon review: A friend gave me a copy of this book because she thought I would love it.  I loved it, but my wife didn't like it.  But, I have listened to most of the songs and they are great.  So, I gave the book to my friends son.  He is a big fan of classical music, and he loves listening to classical music, but he is very stubborn and he won't listen to most of the albums.  So, he gave me a copy on his birthday.  Since people don't usually like classical music, I gave him some of the pop albums.  He gave me another copy on his birthday.  I told him to listen to the albums I gave him.  I told him he should listen to all of the classical albums, but he said he doesn't listen to them.  So, I gave him the book.  He has listened to every album, and he loves them.  He thinks the book is great.  He told me to give the book to his friends.  He is going to listen to it.  I told him that he should.  I told him that the book is great.  He was very excited.  Since he is a very stubborn man, he asked me to give the book to his friends.  I told him that he had to listen to the albums that I gave him and he had to listen to the classical albums.  He was very excited.  He gave the book a 3.5 out of 5.  So, I guess it was all good.  I also told him that this is the book I have given to my friends that I love the most.  I love my friends, and since I was giving them the book, I wanted them to have it.  I don't want them to get it.  I wanted them to be happy with it.  So, I gave them another copy.  I told them to listen to all of the albums that I gave them.  I told them to listen to them all.  And, I told them that they could give the book to their friends.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Unfortunately, while I was listening to this song, her attention wandered to the screen and she turned the iPad off and on. After a few minutes, the song was over, but I didn't know why and decided to return it. I did not. I have never received a single negative review of this app. Many people have said its the best way to read to toddlers because you can do it on the iPad and it won't get in the way of the reading.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

“Some Good Years” by The Guess Who

For me, this song brought back memories of the 80s, when I was very young and very naive. I’m thinking back to the 80s and the music that was going on in my life.  I’m thinking back to the 80s and the music that I was listening to everyday.  To the 80s and all the pop music that was popular at the time.  I remember the songs that I was listening to like “Somebody To Love”, “Take It Easy”, and “Love Is A Battlefield“.  This song was on a lot of those songs.  I loved this song as a kid.  I remember this song was on a lot of the old 90s pop and rock songs that I listened to.  I loved this song.  I can remember when this song came out.  I was only about 11 or 12 years old when this song came out and when I first heard this song.  I fell in love with this song.  I fell in love with this song.  I can remember when this song came out and it was a very popular song at that time.  When I first heard this song, I couldn’t believe it.  I didn’t like it at all.  I thought the singer sounded like a punk rocker.  I thought the music was too loud and it was too fast.  I thought I was going crazy and I was going to puke.  I thought this song was over the top.  I was in a band back in the day and when this song came out we played this song at least once a week.  We loved this song.  We loved this song.  I loved this song.  I loved this song.  I loved this.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.
