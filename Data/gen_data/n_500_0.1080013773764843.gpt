Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: If you don't like rock music from the early '80s, I don't know what kind of music you're into.  But, if you like what you hear, then this album is well worth your time and money.  And, if you like the songs that we have here from the likes of Pink Floyd, Rush, and Yes, then this is a must-have for you.  I have heard their albums and this is my favorite of theirs.  They are in my top 5 favorite albums I have ever heard.  And, I know they are still great and not to be taken lightly.  Roger and Paul are still great.  I believe Paul has the better voice.  Roger is a great man.  Roger and Paul were very talented and have been on the road performing for many years.  When you hear the songs on their albums, you feel the passion in the music and the story that is told.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Yes. I was very happy with the new album "The Dark Side Of The Moon".  And, I am happy that the new album is not only my favorite Pink Floyd album but also my favorite band of all time.  I mean, I still love their music, I think it is one of the greatest albums of all time, but I am not so sure about the new album.  I was disappointed in the new album.  I mean, I love all of Pink Floyd's music, but this album is not as good as the others.  The songs are not as interesting.  There is only one song in the new album that is a little bit catchy.  No matter how you feel about the new album, it was still a very good one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Not sure what to say about this album, but it is pretty good.  Paul's voice is good, and Roger's voice is better than mine.  The album is a little bit too long, but not bad.  The songs are a little bit repetitive, but they are good.  I do like them.  I think the album is good, but the songs are not as good as the others.  I like them all, but some are better than others.  And, I like all the songs, and would listen to the album over and over again.  I like the songs and think they are all good.  They are not great, but they are good.  I think they are good, but they are not great.  They are not bad, but they are not great either.

Amazon review: I have heard this album, and I was very surprised.  I liked it, but I am not sure that it is a good album.  This album is definitely not the best album from Pink Floyd.  That is for sure.  It is a great album.  But, I think the songs are very repetitive and boring.  I like the songs in this album, but they are not the best of the Pink Floyd.  I would not say that this album is one of the worst Floyd albums, but I think it is not the best album from Pink Floyd.  I think it is more of a good album.  But, it is not the best.  I think the album is good, but not the best.  And, I think the songs on this album are a little repetitive and forgettable.  I like the songs though.  I do not really mind the songs in this album.

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.

Amazon review: I don’t know if I really want to listen to this album; it’s boring music and I don’t have any idea what I’m supposed to be listening to. It’s pretty much generic heavy metal, with a lot of guitar work and a few songs having a more “rock” sound. I have no idea what I’m supposed to be listening to in this album. In the end, I don’t really feel like I want to listen to it.

Amazon review: I purchased a CD of Korn III for my girlfriend to listen to as a gift. I didn't know much about their music, other than that they were on "Metal Alliance" and I thought it would be a good gift. I was very pleasantly surprised at how much she enjoyed it. I really didn't think it would be any good but it is and she really enjoyed it. I bought it for her to listen to when she's depressed, so it will help her feel better.

Amazon review: I bought this album as a gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loved it. The only thing that bothered me was how many songs there were. The lyrics were all very good, but I wish they were shorter. I think the main reason I like this album is because it is very different from any other Korn album. If this was their first album, I would be happy because it will be an excellent album. If this was their 15th album, I would be less happy because I think they are overproducing just to keep up with the Joneses.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

I've had a bunch of problems with my music downloading, but I'm starting to be more patient.  The latest problem was getting a Korn album.  I had to go back and redownload the most recent Korn album, because Amazon's system was locking everything that was on my computer down.  I'm not a huge fan of Korn, but when one of the few good albums of theirs is available for free (at the time of this review) I'll definitely get another album.

Amazon review: I've been a Korn fan since they first came out and have been listening to most of their albums. I've always been a big fan of the band.  The album "The Path of Totality" is the most recent album I've heard and it is by far the best Korn album in my opinion.  In my opinion this is the band's best album.  I will buy their next album, and probably buy every album they release in the future.

Amazon review: this is the best album I have ever heard and I am from the UK.  I have been listening to Korn for years and have never been this happy with a band in my life.

The lyrics are really good and the music is absolutely superb.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.

It's so good, I didn't even listen to the CD until I found it at my local record store.  The Man of La Mancha was one of the best albums from the late 80's, and this one is just as good.  As a bonus, the CD includes an alternate version of "El Hombre De La Mancha" with the original vocals.  I am so glad that I bought this, as it's a nice addition to my collection.

They just make the songs better.  I'm glad that they made a follow up to the Man of La Mancha album.  This is just as good and just as fun to listen to.

Amazon review: This is a great song, but I'm not sure how many people will be able to appreciate it, because it's actually more of a "cover" than it is a song that belongs to Farrah. Very little of the original is present in this version.  The lyrics are very simple, and the melody is just as simple.  The song is an excellent example of the "classical" vocal style which was also used by a lot of other groups like The Four Seasons, and even The Shangri La.

Amazon review: This song rocks!  It's so simple and beautiful.  The lyrics are very poetic, and the melody is very wonderful.  It's Farrah's most underrated song, and I love it so much.  It's one of Farrah's best songs.  Farrah's voice is truly beautiful, and she has a voice that can be described a "Classical" vocal quality.  The arrangement is very beautiful, there is a good melody to the song, and her voice is very beautiful.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G.

It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: If you are interested in this type of music, then this is a good choice.  I know that the lyrics go along with the melody, which is very clear in the beginning.  The track was short and I enjoyed it.  The tracks have been played over and over again since I bought it.  I listened to it on my MP3 player and on my Walkman.  I also used it while driving my car and also listening to my Walkman.  The track was very relaxing.  It is very relaxing to listen to this type of music, yet there's still a lot of energy and power.  I like the positive and uplifting energy that comes out of it.  I use it to keep me awake until the day is over.  It is a great way to wake up in the morning.  It keeps me alert for a long time.  You should buy it as it is the only product I know of that works for me.

I have been listening to it for a very long time and it has really gotten into me.  I listen to it when I am driving my car.

I used to listen to this with my husband and now we listen to it every night.  I use it every night before I go to bed.  I put it on the speaker and when it gets on I listen to it for about 20 minutes.  I do this every night and it helps me fall asleep very quickly.  The music is pretty clear but you could use earplugs if you are the type of person who doesn't like background noise.

A little something I found when my new album came out. I have been enjoying the albums of The Beatles now for a long time. I have never had the opportunity to see them live, and this is the closest I am ever going to get. I would like to thank the Beatles for the inspiration they gave to me and to my whole family.

This is a great album, and all four albums in the series are great albums. I love this series of the Beatles. It's a little strange that I love the Beatles so much, but now that I have listened to this, I realize how much more I love them. It's so amazing that they are such a great influence on people. They are one of the most influential bands, in my opinion

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

I would have liked to hear a couple of them on a different album.  The last song is a good one but I feel like it should have been his most recent one.  I don't know what happened to Ne-Yo.  He wasn't good in his last album too.  I don't know why he kept going back and forth on this one.  I'm really starting to wonder if he wants to be a super star or a super broke star.

Amazon review: This song was OK.  The lyrics were ok but the instrumentation was bad.  I had the same problem with this album.  The instrumentation was too similar to other songs on the album.  The guitar and bass are the same but the drums and vocals are not.  It was like listening to a CD that you had to play over and over to hear a song.  This made it hard to listen to the song while driving and watching TV.  I found that the beat was a little too different from the previous songs on the album.  Some of the lyrics are repetitive.

Amazon review: OK this is a good song.  It has a good beat and the lyrics are very well put together.  I do think it would have been better with the same instrumental track as in the other songs.

Amazon review: This song is a total ripoff of the best song ever.  It's really annoying to listen to. It's supposed to be a tribute to R&B artist, Erykah Badu.  I guess it's not a big enough surprise to make it a classic but it's just so disappointing that I will have to give it a negative rating.  I don't understand the hype and demand for this song.  The first time I heard this song I thought it was a ripoff of Erykah Badu's "Come Alive" and I immediately hated it.  Now I like it better than any of the songs I've heard by Ne-Yo.

Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.

Amazon review: My 14 months old baby loves this song. Quality is great. I wanted exactly same sinsong, singed by same singer etc. and I think this is it!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: very old school, but was looking for the song for a frend
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like my music to sound like I'm actually singing. I like to have the lyrics in my head when I put my hands over my ears. I prefer to have a melody in my head. The lyrics of this song are very old-school. This song would make a great Christmas song. I would love to hear this song sung by anyone other than Kelly Price, as I find her voice to be unpleasant and the sounds she makes to be annoying. This is a great song, and I would recommend it to anyone. It's actually one of my favorites. I would recommend this song to any person who likes to sing along and who likes old-time music. It is very hard to find a song for Christmas. This song is one of my favorites. I would recommend this song to anyone who likes to sing along and who likes old-time music.

You're the one I want to kiss
You got it all
But I've got more than you
I've got two hearts
I've got two loves
My heart and my head
I've got two hearts
My heart and my head
I've got two hearts
My head and my love
I've got two loves
My head and my love
But it's you and only you
(You know)
It's you and only you
(You know)
It's you
It's you
It's you
It's you
(You know)
It's you and only you
I've got two
