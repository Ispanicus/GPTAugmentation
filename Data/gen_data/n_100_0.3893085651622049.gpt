Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: When I was about 10 years old, I used to go through phases of "I'm gonna buy this album" until the day I bought this album, which is "In the Closet."

It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with your comment. As with most Broadway shows, it's almost a joke. I don't understand why people are so upset over it. I could listen to it all day. The worst thing about it is that the person that plays the lead vocals doesn't have the ability to write his own songs, so the songs just come out in a monotone, robotic fashion. I'm sure he's good at singing, but he's not good at writing his own music. If that's the case, then I won't be purchasing his music. I'm not an audiophile, but I do listen to songs on the radio.

It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: This is a good song.  It is the best on this album.  I like it, but I have to say it was one of the weaker songs on the album.  I am very partial to the lead in and out, especially in "I Never Had a Dream".  It is one of my favorite songs on this album, and it was a very good choice for the song.  If you like the song you will like the album.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of any REO Speedwagon release.  I have never bought a CD from them.  I have not listened to them in a while.  I am sure they will be back.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I have no idea how this CD came to be on the internet, but it seems that the CD is not a real recording.  It has a couple of tracks that sound like they were recorded from a tape deck.  The bass drum and snare are very loud and harsh.  I did get a very faint noise at the beginning of the song "Aeroplane" which could be the recording of a motor running.  Also there are some sounds that appear to be interference from a radio or television, but they are very faint.  I was really impressed with this CD because I had never heard or seen a Tom Waits CD in person.  It is a very good CD.  I don't know if it was made by a local band, but I doubt it.  It was recorded by a live band at a concert.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you think that you don't like Tom Waits, then you haven't heard him live.  This is the first Tom Waits album I have had.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Tom Waits since his first solo album.  I am not a huge fan of the man, but I am a fan of his music.  I was hoping to find a recording of his band, but it was not to be.  This album is a real gem.  I have it on CD and in digital jewel box.  The sound is clean, but not perfect.  I would like to have a better quality sound system to listen to this album.  The album has two songs that are not included in CD.  The first is a song called "The Man in the Mirror" and the other is called "I'm a Star".  I do not know why they are excluded, but I don't see how anyone could enjoy this album unless they are a Tom Waits fan.  These are the only songs excluded.  I give this album 4 stars.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: This song, for some reason I can't figure out, has a certain kind of feel.  I think it's a song about the death of love.            This is a horrible song, and I don't understand why it has the #1 spot.  It has no sense of structure, there is no melody, and it's completely out of place in the otherwise great album.  I have never heard a song that felt like this.  This song is a waste of time.

Amazon review: This is a really good, beautiful song.  It's a great song for a little child that is trying to learn to read.

Amazon review: The music for the video is a little more interesting than the songs. The video of the band performing these songs is entertaining and somewhat interesting. However, I found the accompanying music to be a little too generic and boring for my taste.  The song "Good Feeling" from the album is the best song on the album.  The song "All I Really Need" is decent, but not especially great.  The other songs on that album are also good, but not great.  I really don't know what to make of this album.

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the original version of this song, but I was also a big fan of the remix.  It was a nice change of pace.  I was disappointed by this release, I thought it would be the "original" version but in reality it was the remix.  I like the remix better.

Amazon review: I have played this song on the radio for years.  It's a great little pop song.  It's the only one that I have on my CD. It's very repetitive as well, the lyrics are the same for the first half of the song, then the chorus is repeated.  I also have a version of this done by the original artist and he is very talented.  This version is very long and requires 2 CDs to fit it on one.  This version is very good.  The beat is very good and the song is catchy.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: Tom Waits is at his best here, very well played, with an excellent mix of blues and country.  The vocal is excellent, and the production is top notch.  I can't believe that you've gone to the trouble to make a cd of Tom Waits, and you can't find a single good track.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this for a few hours now and it's just not cutting it for me.  It sounds flat, boring, and just plain bad.  It also seems like I'm listening to the same song over and over again and not moving on much.  Maybe if I really get into it I'll find it more enjoyable.

Amazon review: This is not a bad album, but I was not really fond of Tom Waits.  He does not really try to be a great singer, but rather just sings what comes to mind.

I'm glad I never saw The Piano Lesson or I would not have bought this cd, if it were not for the fact that I enjoy listening to Tom Waits so much.

Amazon review: A poor album, but I like Tom Waits.  I don't think he is a great singer, but he does make great music.  This album has no songs that I like.  I am not a fan of "the blues", but I do love to listen to the Tom Waits stuff.  I do my share of listening to the blues, but I listen to a lot of Tom Waits.  I like how he is able to make the blues sound like he is singing, even though he isn't.  I don't think he would even consider singing like this if he were in a band that played the "real blues".

The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

I tried to listen to the songs in order, and some songs were still on the same track, but some were just looping endlessly.

Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: “The blues was a style that was invented by the black man.  The blues is the best form of music  of the ages.  It is music of the soul.  It is music of the heart.”    The blues is a musical expression, not a strict genre.  The blues is a kind of music that has its roots in African music but has been influenced by black and white music and culture.  The blues is the universal music of the American people.  It is music that can be heard across all boundaries and from all cultures.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album was so good, I couldn't stop listening to it.  In my opinion, they are the real deal.  The only band I've ever seen them in concert that is able to keep up with them.  I have a hard time believing that any other band would be able to do what they do. I have been buying them since I first heard them.  I don't think they will stop recording and performing.  I wish I could live in that time.   This album will stay in my top 3 in terms of greatest albums of all time.  This is the best album so far with any band.  I am a huge fan and will never stop listening to them.  I have seen them several times and each concert is a different experience.   They are still going strong and have new music on the way.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this album was great but I must admit that the lyrics and the band's music are a bit repetitive.  I had a hard time getting into this album.  I would rather this band go on a hiatus or disappear.  I do not like the sound of Lorde and I do not like her music.  I have been told that Lorde has had a very hard life.  I believe this.  I think she is pretty good though.  She has a voice and she knows how to use her voice.  I do not have a problem with her music.  I just feel that is all she is.  As far as the album goes, I thought it was all great.  The band has a lot of talent and I am glad we have them.  I hope they continue to play because they are great.  They are one of my favorite bands.  I will always have them in my collection.  They are a band that I can listen to and enjoy for hours and hours.

She is very talented, but doesn't get enough credit.  It is just a shame that she has to change her style all the time.  Maybe she should look at other styles and just stay in one.  I don't really like the song I am listening to.  I don't think I want to listen to another song by her.  I don't really like her music.  The album is good though.  I don't think she can sing but she has a good voice.  I don't like her at all.  She is just weird.  She has a very nice voice but she doesn't use it correctly most of the time.  I like the album though.  It is good.  It is very good.  I like the songs and I like the story, it isn't bad.  I think it was very good.  I am glad to get an album by her.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: Not my kind of music.  I'm sorry but it's not my idea of a good time.  It's not an album that I'd listen to when I'm alone in a dark room with a good book.  It's too loud,  too much bass,  and frankly too boring.  I just don't like it.  And it's not all that good.  In fact, as a whole,  it's just a bad album.  I would recommend it only to a complete beginner who really wants to get to know a band they're going to like.  And then to a person who would like to just get to know Tom Waits anyway.  It's a nice album,  I guess.  And that's why I didn't review it.  This isn't a review of a band.  It's a review of an album.  And this is an album,  not a band.

This was a lot of fun.  It was a lot of fun.  I wish I could have been there.  And the band was very good.  I have to say,  though,  that I was not impressed with the music.  It's kind of a mix of  '70s rock and '90s indie rock.  Very energetic but not very catchy.  There are a few good songs but most of them just seem to meander.  They also seemed to be playing the same songs over and over.  They also didn't seem to have any songs that were really that unique or original.  I don't know if they've done this song or not.  But they did a good version of "The End of the World".  And that's about it.  It's an album that everyone should play at least once in their lives.  Then they can write a review once they hear it.

But the music was just way too loud.  It was just way too loud.  I just don't understand why they're playing the songs they're playing.  I know that Tom Waits is famous for going out of his way to make the most out of every song he sings.  And I think he's right because he was very much into this album.  But the song selection just sounded like the band was trying to make the most out of the song they were playing a few hours earlier.  They were just too over the top.  And I think the performance was a lot more fun back in the day.  And that's why I didn't review it.
