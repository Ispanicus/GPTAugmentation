Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: So far, the CD has only been played once.  I listened to the CD twice and got the same message. I guess I should have listened to it a third time.  The lyrics are good, but the music just doesn't fit the subject matter.  I can't say that I hate the CD, but it is kind of hard to listen to because of the lyrics.  So far I just don't like it.  I'm going to give it a quick listen once more to see if I am missing some of the songs, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Amazon review: I was thrilled to find out that I have at least one new favorite singer on my shelf.  This CD is much better than I have heard in a long time.  Her voice is amazing.  She is totally talented.  I wish she would come to Washington D.C. and sing at the Lincoln Memorial.  I would gladly sing with her.  I don't know what my problem is, but I just can't get into the CD.  It makes me feel like I am sitting in a room watching a movie that isn't worth watching.  The lyrics are okay, but the music is just not something I can relate to.  I love the song "Crazy" by the title.  I like that song.  I guess I just don't like the whole CD.

Amazon review: I've been hearing good things about this CD and the cover art is pretty cool.  However, the music is a very minor part of the album.  I have been listening to it for two days and it is no different than when I first heard it.  I am not really impressed.  The only time I can really connect with anything on the CD is if the song is written by a country artist.  I just don't feel that the songwriting is very good.  It's very repetitive.  I've tried to listen to this CD three times because I know it will probably be my new CD.  I am just waiting for my copy of the CD to arrive.  I will be very upset if I don't like the CD.  I just don't think it's any good.  I don't know what I am doing wrong.

###
Amazon review: It's not a big deal.  I just don't like this CD.  It's not bad, but it's just not good.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  I listen to a lot of country artists so I feel the lyrics are more important than the music.  I'm a little upset that I had to listen to this CD four times before I actually listened to it.  I just don't understand.  It's hard to explain.  I'm going to have to listen to it more.  I really don't know what I'm doing wrong.  I just can't connect with anything on the CD.  It's just not good.  What am I doing wrong.

Amazon review: This is a great piece to listen to.  I love the way the choir sings.  I always think of these things when I hear a choir singing.  It makes me think of the people that were killed when I watch the news.  It gives me strength and hope.  The only reason this does not make the top 20 is because there is too much repetition in the music.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times and find it to be very enjoyable.  It is a very soothing piece of music.  I have always been interested in church music and this one is very nice.  It is a great uplifting piece to listen to.  The only negative thing I can say is that I wish the chorus had sung more of the music at the end.  The ending of the chorus was very good but they should have sung more of the music at the end.  I thought it was very good and wish I could have seen them do that the entire time.

Amazon review: I really like this CD.  It is a very uplifting and happy music.  There are some parts that I wish were louder because it is a very soothing piece.  It gives me a great feeling of joy.

Amazon review: This is by far the worst song on the album.  I have listened to all of them.  This is the worst.  I am in love with the song "No Church in the Wild" because it has been a struggle to find a church in the wild.  This one is nothing, just a song to be sung to the glory of Jesus.  I am not a Christian because this song is not for me. It won't change my life, my opinion on Jesus, or my life in general.  I am sorry, this is a poor song.  I have never had so much problem with a song on an album.  I wish I could find an album where I could find only songs that I really liked.  I have come to the conclusion that I should just go to church.  I have been to church since I was 12 years old.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This is the first of several albums to be sold by Amazon, so let's start with the obvious.  The album is not in fact the entire opera, and not in fact all of the songs from the opera.  No, indeed, there are a few songs from the opera that have been omitted from the album.  But the rest, there's no way to even begin to list them all here.

Amazon review: The title of this album is a gross misnomer.  The album is actually the first of two discs of the entire opera.  The second disc is entitled "Ladies and Gentlemen, The Orchestra of the American Opera Company performing "The Marriage of Figaro" and the Opera of the Month, "Crocodile".  This album is actually the complete opera, beginning with the first act, and ending with the second act.  The first disc is a recording of the opera by the company, which is the whole opera, including the overture.  The second disc is a recording of the opera by the company, which is only the part of the opera that has been performed in this opera.  So the title of the album is somewhat misleading.

There are also songs which are the "Overture", but not the actual score.

Amazon review: I think Amazon is just trying to get you to buy it and then sell it to someone else. The selection of artists is very average, however, as far as a good selection of singers go.

Amazon review: A few years ago I purchased "A Little Night Music" on iTunes.  I had tried it once before, and I was very suprised.  I thought that the new album by the cast of "Les Miserables" would be much better than the old cast album.  I was wrong.  I bought it and listened to a couple of songs.  They sounded great, but for the most part, it sounded like an old cast album.  There were a few songs that didn't sound like the old cast album at first, but I could tell they were the songs from the old cast album after I listened to them a couple of times.

Amazon review: I can't see the point of the album.  It is a collection of songs from the musical.  But I don't find it to be very good.  There are some good songs, but most of them are the same songs over and over.  I think the songs themselves are good, but the songs are boring.  I can listen to them for 2 or 3 minutes, and I forget I am listening to them.  Once I get to know them, then I find I love them.  But the songs are repeated because there isn't a lot of variety in them.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The only song I did buy was "All the Single Ladies".  It was a good song.  I didn't like the other songs on the CD.  I don't like the songs on some of the other CDs.  I don't like "I want it", "I don't know what to do", "I don't know anything", "All the single ladies" and "Everyday."  Other than that, I just found the songs on this CD to be mediocre.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lyrics to "Ain't No Doubt That"

Ain't no doubt that I've been down this road before
I've gone through it before I've gone through it again
I've done it before
Ain't no doubt that I'm gonna do it again
I've done it before

I've seen it all before
I've been through it all before
I've been through it all before

I've seen it all before
I've been through hell and back before
I've been through it all before

I've seen my share of trouble before
I've seen it all before
I've been through hell and gone before
I've gone through it all before

I have seen it all before
I've been through hell and gone before

I have seen it all before
I've been through it all before

I have seen my share of trouble before
I've seen it all before

I've seen my share of trouble before

I've seen it all before
I've been through the fires before
I've been through it all before

I've seen the whole lot before
I've been through it all before

I've seen everything before
I've been through it all before

I've seen all the way before
I've been through it all before

I've seen hell before
I've been through fire before
I've been through it all before

I've been through it all before

I've been through hell and back before
I've been through hell and gone before
I've gone though it all before

I've been through it all before

Ain't no doubt that I've been a fool before
I've been through it all before
I've been through hell and gone before
Ive gone through it all before
Ain't no doubt that I've been a fool before

I've been through it all before
I've been through hell before
I've been through it all before

I've been a fool before
I've been through hell and gone before
I've been through it all before

I've been the whole lot before
I've been through it all before
I've been through fire before
I've been through it before

I've been through it all before

I've seen the devil before
I've been through hell and gone before
I've been back through it all before
I've been through it all before
I've seen the devil before

I've seen it all before
I've been through fire before
I've been back through it all before
I've been back through it all before
I've seen it all before
I've been through it all

I've been through it all before

Amazon review: Did I like the song.  If I did, I guess I am a little slow on the uptake.  I have to say the song had a really great beat.  But after hearing the first two or three verses, I felt like there was more than what was on the CD.  When the chorus came on, I was so bored with it that I could not sing the chorus.  I will see if I can find a different tape of the song and listen to it again.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: I give this album a low rating because it's probably a bit too late to really get any good music out of this band.  This band should've been doing this from the start of the 90's.  This band is not the same as the one that came out in 1988.  This band has gotten a little bit more mainstream and the only thing that has really improved is the vocal quality.  That's about it.  I don't see this band getting back on that level again for a while.  I gave this album a 4.5 because it is a good album to listen to for those who don't really enjoy this genre.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
