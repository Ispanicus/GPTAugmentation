Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I love Billy Currington!  I listen to him all the time, and I am very glad I am able to purchase this CD. I am not a fan of artists who are not black or white; the only black/white artist I listen to is Jimi Hendrix.  I do enjoy music that is more of my own than the ones that are purely for others to hear.  I have listened to "Billy Currington" for the past 2 weeks, and I have loved it. I think he is so talented, so funny, so cool, so beautiful.  I love everything about him.  I would buy this CD, but only if it is something new or different.  As it is, I am disappointed that it says "Parental Advisory" on it.  It is not a good CD.  It is so boring.  I don't know what kind of music this is, and I don't care.  It is a waste of my money, that I can't find anything on amazon.com to buy.

Amazon review: I listened to this for the first time Monday and then again Wednesday.  It was really good!  The only problem is that the song "What's Up" has a line which is very rude to the woman who is singing the song.  I am not sure if the line is a song lyric or if it is just how the song is sung.  Either way, the line was not appropriate for this song, and I didn't want to buy it because of it.

Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: This is the second song that's on the CD that's not available for download so I'm not really sure if I'll purchase this CD.  I mean, at first I was really excited about the "uncommon" song that was chosen to be on the CD, "This is all for me" by Lenny Kravitz, but then I started to think about the song itself, and the lyrics, and I just wasn't too impressed with it.  The song is OK, but not that great.  I'd rather hear a song I would actually listen to and buy an album of.  This CD could've been an alternate version of "This is all for me" or it could've been an alternate version of "Do you wanna get down".  Either way, the song was mediocre.  3 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not really a strong review, but if you don't like this song then don't buy this CD.  I'm pretty sure it's a cover of the Kravitz song, but it's not as good as the original.  I guess they didn't have any money to spend on a full band, so they just used the backing tracks.  The drums are OK, but the guitar sounds a lot like some of the other Kravitz songs I've heard.  The lyrics are good, but the singer sounds like he's reading from a script.  The song has a tempo that's much slower than normal, but it's a good song.  3 stars.

I just want to tell him that.  Then I would tell him I love him too, and that I hope he's happy.  Then he would say: "You're just like me.  I'm too cool for that."  He actually told me!  I'm going to have to listen to it to believe that.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: Wonderful music, as always by Josh Groban.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I must say, while the music is nice, the vocals are awful.  That is not to say that the vocals on this album are terrible, but I just didn't like them at all.  Their harmonies are a little off, and the songs are repetitive and boring.  At least on the first two tracks, the vocals are nice.  But, they just are no where near good enough to give an album of this kind a 'good' review.  I have to give this a'very poor' rating.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 stars is because there are so many good songs on it.  If you don't like a song on the album, you could always go back and listen to the others.  This album is very good and has great songs.  I'm not sure why all these albums have great songs on them.  They sound so similar.  I think a lot of them sound the same and the music is just repetitive.  This album sounds very diverse.

This album is great.  The album is very different from everything you've heard before.  The guitar playing is so good that you can't believe it's not on a different artist's album.  The drums are so good that you have to give them a four star.  The guitar playing is so good it makes you wanna listen to the guitar playing for hours.  The vocals are terrible, but it's the only voice that can sing this song.  This is a great album.  I love it.  It has a great message.  I love this album.  The music is so good on this album.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: This album is a little bit of a letdown, it could have been fantastic, but we all know that isn't true. The first song, "Polaris" is just a really bad song about the fact that it's winter. I've been listening to this album on repeat for the past 3 days, I've been listening to it while I'm working, walking, everything. Every time I hear a song I find to be just ok on the radio I end up listening to it again. So I guess it might be a let down, but it's worth it.
