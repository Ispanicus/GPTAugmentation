Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I have never listened to this album, but from the very first song I could tell that it wouldn't be the same without Korn. I really can't say how much I liked Korn in the past, but I don't think I would have been able to give it a 2 star review. It's really good, and I'm excited for the next album.  I was expecting it to be a huge change, but to me it just seems to be the same album with a different band (sadly). I mean, "Smooth" and "Amen" to me are the same song.  I'm sorry, but I cannot listen to "Amen" and "Smooth" the same day.  I think I'll stick to the one I've always had.

Amazon review: I'm soo excited for this album. I really enjoy listening to Korn, and I can't wait for the album to come out.  I'm also glad that there is a new album, and I want to listen to it as much as I can.  I don't think I would have done well with this album if it wasn't for Korn.  I would have just put it in my play list to listen to as I went along. I'm looking forward to Korn III as well as to Korn II.  I think I will still get the 2nd album, but I don't think I will put it on the CD player.  (Although I am looking for an album with Korn to get my wife to listen to it.)

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I have always loved this band.  When I was young I always had a little cassette player with a little tape deck in my bedroom.  I would listen to this band every night. I had a few cassette player and cassette tape players and a small record player.  One night I had to get up at 2 am to go to work.  I put the cassette player on the bedside table, loaded in the cassette tape that was playing and put the cassette on the record player.  I put on some music that I liked, like the new album on the CD version of "Love, Peace and Happiness" by Fireflight.  I had the cassette player on the radio but I was still able to hear the music that I loved.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I loved the first season of Glee. I loved how the show was able to take on the issues of gay culture, and use the characters to talk about real life issues. I loved the music and I loved the show. What can I say? It's my favorite show on TV. Then they decide to do a musical. I was thrilled when I first heard about the show. I started buying the CDs. And then the show started to get cancelled. I was devastated. In the end I was able to get my money back from iTunes, but I still hate it. It's so sad. I don't understand why they're doing this to the show. I'm not a gay rights activist. I don't even like gay people. I don't like gay culture. I'm not a gay Christian. I'm not a gay Republican. But I like Glee.

Amazon review: Love this song.  Loved it for the first 3 minutes, then started to get boring.  I wish the first thing I could do with this was find a way to record my own version.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I was looking for this song, but I wasn't sure which album to purchase. I listened to the previews and heard so much of it that I thought I would try it. I ended up buying the LP. The LP has the same song in the same order on the liner notes. The album is not a perfect version of the song, but it has the same sound and the same feel as the other versions. This is the first time I've bought an album online, so there are some things I need to get used to, but so far so good.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of country music but I do listen to it.  I listen to "The Old Man and the Moon" a lot and I wanted to try to get one of the songs from it on an album for my collection. I found "Dirty Old Town" through these reviews. I had to get it on the album.  I wish I would have found it sooner.  It's a great song, but too many songs are too country to be on an album.

Amazon review: I was really excited to receive the CD.  The cover is different from the album.  I wanted to get the album but I also wanted to do the live shows.  I bought the CD and listened to it for the first time last night.  My daughter is very familiar with the songs on the album. She has been singing them for years.  She sang every song the entire time I listened to the album.  She loved the songs.  This is a great album.  It's a good album with good songs.  I don't think I'll delete it.

I loved listening to the song "Dirty Old Town" and "I'll Take Her".

Amazon review: I bought this album when I was in high school at a record store.  I was very excited.  I got the first song on the album and I heard "Dirty Old Town" and I fell in love.

I was so excited about the songs I got on the album, but I was disappointed in the songs I didn't get.

I loved the song "I Love a Rainy Day" and I loved "Old Man and the Moon" and "Dirty Old Town".  I didn't like "I'm Not That Kind of Girl" and "What's It Gonna Be".  I didn't like any of the songs.

It's funny because I still love all the songs I've played.  So please, just enjoy.  The song is called "Buck and the Beanstalk" by James Taylor.  It's from his album "I Want To Know What Love Is" (1988).

I was so disappointed.  I immediately contacted Amazon and they were able to get me another copy.  I'm glad I got that second copy.

I love the way it sounds, the lyrics are great and the song is a great song to sing along to.  I hope this song is on here.  I'm not sure if I can do a video with this song.  It is a really cool song so I would like to have it on here.

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I was expecting a very full-on metal album. Instead this is a very good mix of blues rock and hard-edged hardcore punk. I was pleasantly surprised! I was expecting a hard rocker. Instead, you get a nice mix of rock and punk that is still very heavy. If you like the rock-based hard-edged hardcore punk I think this is the CD for you. It is good music but it is not for everyone. The more I listen the more I like it.

Amazon review: This CD will take you back to the days when you listened to nothing but "Cali" metal. If you are looking for a band that is hard and fast and yet still has a touch of the softer side of things, then you need to check this CD out.

Amazon review: This CD has a great mix of hard-edged hardcore punk and heavy metal, but it doesn't try to be either of them. It has a great mix of hard-edged hardcore punk and heavy metal, without either, and it is at a rock and roll level, without being one.

Amazon review: This is the third album from this band. I have heard the first two, but this one is by far the best. The playing is very good, the lyrics are very good and the music is great. This CD is also a great mix of hard-edged hardcore punk, heavy metal and rock and roll, without trying to be any of them. It's the best of the bunch so far.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: I really didn't like the music. I expected it to be Christmas themed and exuberant like the other TSO albums I have. The few instrumentals were pretty good, but the other selections were boring.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed. I had been hearing a lot about this band for a while now, but I had not experienced it until I saw them play. It has a very simple and dull sound. The vocals have no power or emotion. I also found the lyrics to be repetitive and boring. I really don't understand how Bob was able to write songs like that and get away with it. I will buy a few more of his albums but for now I will have to look for other artists.
