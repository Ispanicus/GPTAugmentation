Amazon review: Great cd. This is the only cd I have found with so many great songs on one disc. Usually there are a couple good hits along with average or below average hits. From start to finish this cd will have you saying " I have forgotten how great that song is". Definitely recommend to any 70s music fan.

Amazon review: Once again, Micheal Castaldo has brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of PRAY'R.  Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.  This song, done in both Italian and English, proves once again, that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language. Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: This cd is ok, and the songs are ok. I will say that a little too much was missing, but it is ok. I do think that the songs could be better, like a little more variety.

Amazon review: I bought this cd because of the reviews on Amazon. I have been wanting to buy this cd for a long time, and I finally bought it as I really loved the songs on it. I don't really have much to say about it, but I thought it was funny. I never thought I would like any of the songs on this cd, even the ones I have heard before. I did not like any of the artist, but I thought the songs were very nice. The songs I like are: DUSTIN ROWE, HARD TIMES, GIMME SOME, ROCK AND ROLL, SADIE, PRAY'R, and LOVE IS LIFE.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this cd on and off for a couple of weeks now and have enjoyed it very much. The only thing I don't like about this cd is that it has a lot of filler songs. The song "Rock and Roll" is the best song on the cd. There is a song called "Crying" and "The Sun Is Shining". I also liked the songs "Rock and Roll" and "Gimme Some". I think the biggest reason I like this cd is that it has a lot of different artists on it, the only ones I haven't heard before are "The Sun Is Shining" and "Gimme Some". I think the songs are very different, and I think they are on a different level. The other thing I like about the cd is that it is more country than rock and roll. That is why I bought this cd, because I love country music. I did not like "The Sun Is Shining" and "Gimme Some", so I am glad that I did not buy them.

Amazon review: This is a decent cd. I have gotten the impression that the cd is made from the same material as the cd that was released last year. I really like a lot of the songs, however. I would rate it as an 8/10 if I could. The songs are all good. I can't help but feel that this cd would have performed better had there been more variety in the artists. Most of the artists on this cd sound like they are on a different planet from each other. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that "Love Is Life" is not just an instrumental, and that it wasn't just a cover. I didn't expect that, but I was pleasantly surprised. The other thing I thought was good that I didn't expect was the lyrics. I thought the lyrics were good, but not as good as the music. I like the fact that the lyrics seem to be more personal. There are some songs on this cd that seem to be more about the artist than the song.

Amazon review: This is the second time in a couple of years that I have bought a cd and really enjoyed it. The first time I bought it was because I had heard a couple of songs and really liked them. After listening to this cd, I decided that I had to buy it again. The songs I liked the most on this cd are "Love Is Life" and "HARD TIMES". The only thing I didn't really like about this cd is that the songs seem to be all over the place. That is the only thing I don't like about this cd. I would give it a 7/10. I think that it is pretty good, but it is kind of boring and I think that people who have never heard this cd before will really like it. I think I will buy this cd again, because it is a nice cd with good songs.

Amazon review: This cd was purchased as a gift for my mom for her 70th birthday.

This is my second cd I have purchased. The first cd was purchased for my son and it was good, but I really liked this cd. I don't think that I will buy any more CDs other than this one.

Amazon review: Love it. hate it. It's going to live on as one of the greatest albums of all time. Forever remembered as the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music was, (some of us knew. it was called the underground scenes) I mean lets face it, if anyone remembers 1991 (and i don't mean being 8) you know that Smells like teen spirit blew EVERYONE away. Mainstream rock wasn't supposed to be THAT good. not at that time anyways.  It changed the mainstream.

I tried to play it, but it was very loud and I couldn't hear it so I put it in.  The second CD was worse than the first, and not worth the $6.99 it cost me to receive it.  I was disappointed with the second CD and I don't think it is worth buying.

Amazon review: I've followed Planetshakers for several years now and I own all of their albums. I've never been a big fan of their songwriting. When compared to songwriters like Daniel Bashta, Hillsong, Brian Johnson, David Crowder, Jeremy Riddle and similar artists, PS lyrics always seem elementary. like very surface level. They just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning. But what they lacked in songwriting, they always MORE than compensated for in musicianship.

I'm not a professional reviewer, so I'll keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite tracks (in no particular order).

Amazon review: A great slow song.  I loved this slow song when I was a teen in high school.  I think it came out immediately after "If I Ever."  I thought the tall one was sooooooo fiiiiiiine!  Not too long after, I became a freshman in college.  Music has always been a great companion of mine.  Their unison's are great.  Harmonies A+.  Their tenor and baritone voices are great in this song.  It's a classic.  They remind me of the guys from "The Platters," I think that's my grandparents generation.

Amazon review: This is actually a great song. I am truly a died hard fan for K. Michelle so I do not mind keeping it real. It is about time she is singing something that is a "make up record." She has always recorded break-up records and albums, and now it is great and surprising to hear her sing something new. She is crazy, sometimes rude and take things to the extreme, but one thing that is true is that she can sing! Support real music and trust she will deliver.

Amazon review: I hated their voice at first, and I hated the lyrics. But I listened to the whole thing twice, and it actually is kinda catchy. But everyone is different. For example my sister leaves the room when this song comes on so it really just depends on how the music rings inside your ears.

Snake oil salesman Josh Feuerstein is now pimping out his own wife in his never ending scheme to make money off of poor lost sheeple.

Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD.

Amazon review: It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.

Amazon review: It is always disappointing hearing people saying, "I wanted 'Pretty Hate Machine - Part II'", and the such.  Anybody who has followed Trent Reznor's music career should know to expect something different with everything he releases.  You will never get a 'Part II' to any NIN album, because, from the beginning, Trent Reznor set out to do one thing: innovate.  Rehashing old albums would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature.  "Ghosts", however, pushing Trent Reznor to his creative edge.

Amazon review: It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.

Amazon review: Everything about this album is just bad. From the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting. It's terrible.  Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible. That alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it.

Amazon review: I bought this CD on a whim. I had heard from a friend that the record sounded good, and I wanted to check it out. I didn't really know what to expect, and I was pleasantly surprised. The album is really good. I would have given it a 5 star if it didn't have a song that I didn't like. It's just a song I thought sounded like a Stones song too. And it's not a cover either. The song is originally by another band that did cover songs. So the only reason I would have rated it lower would be that it's a cover, and not that it's a bad song. I'm not sure if I want to listen to a CD like this on a regular basis, but I know I definitely will be buying the CD again.

Amazon review: I have never heard of Cripple Creek. I found this CD on Amazon.com and I was intrigued enough to check it out. I was very disappointed to find out that the CD is a cover of a song by a band I've never heard of called The Velvelettes. However, the CD is really good, and I like the cover of the song. It's a great song. As for the song itself, I didn't like it. It's a song that doesn't have a high quality of music. It's also not a great song, but it's a good enough song to make me want to listen to it.

When I first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier, as if I'd heard it before.  I listened a few more times, and YES, I HAD HEARD IT BEFORE.  It's a reworked version of Yanni's "On Sacred Ground" from his "If I Could Tell You" album!  I listened to Yanni's version and Farish's version most definitely copies from that song!

Amazon review: I could not get more than half way through really boring book.  Not only was it boring but it jumped around in time between chapters.  Drove me crazy. Begins 30 years ago then jumps to present then back to 1822 to present back to 1822 back to present.  The only thing keeping me going to the half way point was waiting for something to happen.  It never did so I gave up.

What a mess...

I've been trying to find a decent music CD to buy for months now.  I'm looking for an 8-10 song CD (not too expensive) without a lot of crap on it (not too many songs that are really bad).  Any suggestions?

I've been trying to find a decent music CD to buy.  I've been looking at 10 albums, but I think I'm just going to go ahead and buy the collection I've been looking at for the last 1 year and call it a day.

I've been trying to find a decent music CD to buy, but I just can't find anything that has any redeeming qualities.  I'm looking for a CD that has:

1. Great songs with great instrumentation
2. Great songs that have great instrumentation
3. Great songs that have great instrumentation and are not too long (I don't want to be spending too much money on my music collection)
4. Great songs that have decent instrumentation (not too much of a "crappy" sound)
5. Great songs that have decent instrumentation and are not long (I don't want to be spending too much money on my collection)
6. Great songs with good production quality

What a mess...

I've been trying to find something to buy that has a decent amount of songs for the cost of 1 cd, and the cd's that I've been looking at from Amazon have been way overpriced.

I've been trying to find a decent music CD to go with my new guitar, and I've been looking at just about everything, but I can't find anything that has enough songs for the price.

I don't want to spend a ton of money on a cd, but I don't want to spend less money on a cd than what I'm used to spending on a cd.

And I don't want to spend a ton of money on a cd, but the more I spend, the more I want to spend, and the more I want to spend, the less I want to spend, and the less I want to spend, the more I want to spend, etc.

This is the last time I'm going to try to find anything to buy.  I may have to stop looking for a good cd and just buy my guitar.

If you had listened to the album "in heat" you would feel cheated.  This is the band's best album yet, the album "In Heat" is the one that holds back this record.

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: I really wanted to like this album as I bought it the first day it came out. I bought it. and also got two bonus tracks "Butterfly" and "Christmas Song" (for a total of 18) on this version. I'm very sorry to say that India's sophomore effort is jinxed. I have listened to it carefully about five times and nothing really stands out. The tracks become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyrics are extraordinarily sappy and preachy. The best song India has done aside from her first album is "Butterfly.

Amazon review: I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm in the process of buying Indian's album "The Devil's Collection". I was very excited to hear that she had a new album coming out. I was disappointed when I listened to the album and realized that the songs didn't sound very good. I was really hoping that she would do something different with her music. I bought the album and then realized that the songs are not very good. I'm not sure why they took out some of the songs and put in the ones that I really wanted to hear. I really like some of the tracks and they're very good but there are some that I don't like. I will definitely buy the rest of the albums but not the one that was released today.

Review written for: This CD is very good. The music is very good and the lyrics are good, but I do not understand how this CD is called Bucks Fizz. It is not really a jazz band. And the songs were very good.

If you are a fan of music like this, you will like this CD. I have not heard many people talking about the songs, but some do. I think many people are not really familiar with the songs of this band. I think this is because they are not very well known.

I like the song of "One, two, three, four", it is very good, but the other songs are not so good. I am not saying that this CD is bad, but I would not recommend it. If you like this band, you will like this CD.

Amazon review: I bought this album on vinyl when it was first released [1972]. "Dos" is Malo's second album and has less vocal content than their brilliant first album titled "Malo" [which I also highly recommend], but once again Malo prove what fine musicians they are with the amazing sounds of the Spanish trumpet often in the lead and, as always with Malo, there is an ensemble of Latin percussion. Each of the six long tracks provides intense listening, if you can manage to sit still that is, many of the rhythms and beats invite body movement.
