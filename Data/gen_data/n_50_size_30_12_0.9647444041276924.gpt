Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is the most disappointing album I have ever listened to. I am not even remotely a musician but I can tell you that I learned nothing about how to play an instrument even though I have tried many times to play the cello. This has absolutely nothing to do with the music either. It is very hard to listen to and it seems like they are trying to make a point.

Amazon review: This is a great album by a great artist. I could not put it down. My friend and I both thought it was great and I think you can tell that we are both very music fans. It's not something you'll ever forget. However, after listening to this album I can't imagine how he made it. I'm a musician and a singer and I will never know how he made it. I really like the music he does but I think he could take a little more time to finish the album. We will be listening to it a lot. I believe that the person who made this album has a true talent and that is why there is so many great songs on it, and I can't wait to listen to the soundtrack for "The Lion King."

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Lin Manuel Miranda since the early 80s, when he was singing in a jazz band. He is a great artist who always manages to find the beauty in the most mundane of events. I have always been a big fan of his music and have been a loyal fan of his work by purchasing the albums and CDs he has released on his own label, MCA. I have never been disappointed with his music. He has always been an artist who puts his heart and soul into his art. This was the first time I have heard him sing on a soundtrack, and I immediately fell in love with his voice. He sang with great ease, and it was as if he knew exactly what he was doing. I will never forget this new CD, and I hope that his next album is even better than this one. This music is truly something you will not be able to put down. His songs are truly touching and he makes the listener feel like he is there with him. You will remember this album for a long time to come.

Amazon review: I would have to say this is a great soundtrack! I have been singing in a choir for 10 years and it was a great way to relax after a long day at work. Hearing Lin Manuel Miranda sing on this album was a great way to pump myself up after a long day at work!

Amazon review: This song has been removed. It is a cover of a song originally by the group The Runaways.  The Runaways have been making music since the early 70s, but this cover was first released in 1980.  They were not able to get their original song back, and so this was a new cover.  The Runaways are a much loved group of musicians, whose music can be found on several videos and DVDs.  I have never heard their original version of the song, but I hear it on the CD that this song was taken from.  I am a big Runaway music fan, so this is disappointing, but I have seen the Runaways live and this song is very nice.  It seems to me this cover is a bit more "hit" than the original song, but I am very picky about covers.  I will leave it here, but will update this review after they give me a new one.

Amazon review: This song was originally by the group The Runaways.  This version is by The Runaways, but was rereleased by The Runaways as their first single from their first album, "Serve Yourself".  This song was re-recorded by The Runaways for their second album, "The Runaways. "  The song was written by Bob Marley and was first released on March 16, 1982, on the "Live at the Wackness" album.  The Runaways were formed in the early 1970s, and have been together for over twenty years.  They have been a very successful group in the music industry.  They have released several successful albums, such as their first album, "The Runaways", and several videos.  They have also had many songs on other albums, such as their second album, "The Runaways".  This song was a huge success of theirs, and was written by Bob Marley.  It was first released as a single on March 15, 1982, and is the second from the album, "Serve Yourself", released in 1982.  The song was re-recorded and released as the second single from the album, "The Runaways," in July 1985, on the "Serve Yourself: The Runaways" album.  The song was re-recorded again, and was re-released in 1990, as a bonus track on the "Serve Yourself: The Runaways" album.  This is the third version of this song, and was first released on December 27, 1990, on the "Runaways" album.  I would say this is another re-release, but I don't know.  This is a nice cover, and the lyrics are in Portuguese.  The song is very well-written, and I think it is very well-played.  If you have the time, you should go see this song live.  It will be a great experience.  I am sorry that I am not able to give you a good opinion.  I would rather listen to this song than "The Runaways," but I guess I will have to change my opinion.  I am sorry.  I will update this review after I get the song back.  The original song is by the group The Runaways.  This is a great song, and I think you should go see it live.  This is the last song on the album, "The Runaways" and it is a great song.  If you have not heard this song, I would say that you should check it out.

The song is a cover of a song originally by the band The Runaways.  The Runaways have been making music since the late 70s.  They were the first band to make rap music, and were the first rap band to have a song on the "Billboard charts." They continue to be a very popular group, and have had several songs on other albums, including their most recent release, "The Runaways."  This song was produced by the band and was first released on the "Live at the Wackness" album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I just read the reviews and this is the biggest downer I've ever read on a product being reviewed. I can't believe how many people gave this album 4 stars. This album is so generic. You can't tell what is country or American or what instrument is what. I'm still not sure what instrument he plays on the record. He's a great singer in his own right. I don't know why people would give this album negative reviews.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought the album, it's very generic. The only positive thing I can say it's that the music is beautiful and the lyrics are really good. I'm not really liking the sound of the album, it's very generic. The only thing that's not generic is that the lyrics are catchy. I don't know if it's because of my age but I think I'm stuck in the middle of 30s or 40s. It seems like I'm not really a millennial.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the album a lot. The songs are very upbeat and have that perfect summer feel. I liked how the album was made. It has some fun and upbeat songs in it. I didn't like some of the lyrics. I don't know if its because of me being a 20 year old or just because I'm not in a mature age category. I think the only thing that's wrong with the album is that some of the lyrics are not fitting for the songs. I like the song "I'm in a Dream" a lot. I like the song "I'm in a Dream" because of the lyrics. I like the phrase "I'm in a dream and I don't want to wake up" I like that phrase because it has that fun youthful feeling to it.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review:  I don't know what to say about this song.  It sounds like a big mess.  It is about a man who gives his wife a $1000 necklace.  He had an affair with another woman.  He tells her he is sorry but he thinks she is using him.  She is not mad and she tells him he is a slime.  Then they go to a store and get married.  They get divorced and he goes back home.  He goes to her house and tells her he doesn't want to live with her anymore and he is going to jail.  Then the woman tells him if you are going to jail you can take his wife with you.  If he goes to jail he will take his wife with him.  The man tells her he has two choices,  to die in jail or to kill himself.  He kills himself.    The song is very sad and the sound is good.  I think it is a good song and it does not waste your time.  The song is very well recorded.  I think it is worth the price of the whole set.  I listened to the whole disc.

My opinion

I love this album. I purchased it as a gift for someone I care about. It is a great collection of songs with some really good songs. I don't think I have heard some of the songs before, like Love is the answer, but the others I have heard before. There are some great covers of other songs. I am not a fan of the jazz and the acoustic version of Kissing the sky.

This is from the first release

I purchased this CD as a gift for my best friend for his birthday. He has been a lover of "classic" rock for as long as I have known him. He is probably the only person in his entire life who has ever listened to Kiss and Led Zeppelin. He has no idea that Kiss and Led Zeppelin have been my favorite bands. (As far as I know). I gave him the CD and told him to play it for his friends. This is one of my favorite CDs. I recommend it to all my friends.

I am a Kiss fan and I love their music. I have been listening to this CD ever since I heard it.

I purchased this disc as a gift for my best friend. I didn't know what to expect. I had no idea what I was getting. My friend is a huge Kiss fan. We got the album and I played it for him. He loved it. He was amazed at the songs and the variety of styles. I think that he will love this CD.

I am a Kiss fan and I love their music. This is his first CD I have ever given him. He is a huge Kiss fan. I tried to play the whole CD for him. I played the first two songs. He loved them. I started with the song "California Girls" and he didn't hear it. He was not a fan of the Beatles' song "I Want to Hold Your Hand". He is a huge Beatles fan. I told him he had to hear the song "I Want to Hold Your Hand". He was shocked at first but he finally heard it. He was amazed at the song and he loved it. He was very impressed with the variety of styles and the new songs. He loved the whole album and I am glad to be able to give him this album.

I am a Kiss fan and I love their music. The album has a really great collection of songs. I am not sure if I will buy any more Kiss albums, but this is one that I will definitely be adding to my collection.

I never heard Kiss until my husband played this cd for me. He is a huge Kiss fan. When I first heard this cd I loved it. I thought it was awesome.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I thought it was a good album, as you say, but it would be nice if they had a little more variety.

I really liked the "My Christmas" song. I think it was a nice way to end the CD, though it did get a little repetitive since there were so many songs.

The rest of the songs were good but they were all the same song repeated over and over, and the ending was a little too similar to the first CD.

The only reason I bought the album was because of the cover art, I like it, and the songs are good. I liked the songs on the second CD but they were all the same songs and the ending was quite similar.

I would have liked to have seen more variety but it was an interesting album, the songs were good and the ending was good, but I didn't like the amount of songs and the ending was repetitious.

I gave this one a 7.5 star rating, but I would have liked to see more variety.

Amazon review: I love this! I was very glad to have found it. I would have purchased it originally, but at the time it was $29.99. Now the price is under $10 - good for a song or two so I can enjoy more music of this genre. Also, I love that they are making original music. The sound is good, but the lyrics are better. So, I still think that this will be one of my favorites. I will be purchasing this again.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I was very impressed with the sound of these guys in the concert.  They sounded like they were really up to the task.  I could tell they had been working on this music for a long time.  I have been a fan of choral music for several years but this CD is really good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The music is very good, and the lyrics are great.  The chorus really stood out.  The other choruses were OK.  However, I think their music is a little too much of a rush, and the group doesn't have enough dynamic to go with it.

This is a good album.  I wasn't sure how they would do live, but they did really well.  The performance was really good.  I like their vocalists.  As far as the music goes, it's good.  I wasn't sure what they were going to sound like live but they did a great job.

Amazon review:
This CD is a must have for any choral music lover.  The voices are strong and full.  The music is beautiful and well written.  The music is very simple and easy to sing along to.  The choruses are very short and very sweet.  The only downfall is the production.  While the album is in CD, it has no printed lyrics.  The disc, while on CD is only two pages, the lyrics are in the booklet.  The booklet has some nice liner notes for the music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't want to give this album away, but I would like to mention that the lyrics are great.  They are very simple and relate well to the songs they are singing.  There is another CD that has the same set of lyrics, but I haven't listened to it yet.  So, while I don't know what the words mean, I know what they sound like.

###
Amazon review:  I have been a fan of choral music for a while, and a fan of Robert Johnson for a while now.  So I was a bit nervous when I bought this CD, but after some listening, I must say I am really glad I did.  The album has a great blend of styles.  The songs are upbeat, but the style is very simple.  The music is easy to sing along to.  The only problem I had with the audio quality was when it first started playing, the music kept cutting out.  But after a while the audio quality improved.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:
This is a good CD, and I recommend it to anyone who loves the choral music that is Robert Johnson.  The songs are well written, and the music is very easy to sing along to.  The singers have a very nice, clear, and smooth voice, and the music is beautiful.  I also believe that Robert Johnson's music is a little too simplistic, and the style is kind of boring, but it is good to have a good listen to something that is a little bit different.

Amazon review: This song was produced by The Chordettes, an all woman group that originally started in the late 1960s.  The Chordettes have been called "The Last Great Generation of Blues Singers."  The Chordettes were a very popular and highly influential group of singers that played a style of music that was very similar to the blues.

I had heard many people say that this was the best Schubert album, but I would say it is the best Schubert album ever.  I am not sure that I would go back and buy another.  It is a good way to introduce yourself to Schubert.

Amazon review: This is a very good CD, as far as I am concerned, although I do not listen to much classical music.  I was introduced to Schubert through this CD.  I do not know if it is the best CD ever, but it is certainly a good introduction to Schubert.  I have already recommended the CD to several people.

Amazon review: I listened to this CD and it is very good.  I would recommend this CD to any person that wants to know about Schubert.

I would recommend this CD to any person that wants to know what Schubert is all about.

Amazon review: This is not your ordinary "Schubert" album.  If you are a classical music lover, this is a good choice to listen to.  I have listened to it several times and I have to admit I am enjoying it.  I would not have bought this CD if I had not been searching for something Schubert related.  I have a couple of favorite singers and this CD is a good mix of songs that I like and songs that I do not like.  I have also heard some of the songs on this CD sung by Schubert himself, and he did a very nice job.  This CD is a good mix of songs that are not popular and songs that are not popular.  I am not sure that I would have listened to this CD if I had not been searching for something Schubert related, but I am glad that I did.

Amazon review: This is a good-sounding CD.  I have also heard this CD several times and I find it very enjoyable.  The music is varied and I enjoy the female vocalists.

There are some songs that I have not heard performed by the singers, and some that I have not heard sung.  I do not

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
