Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: This is a really good album.  This is one I would recommend.  It is not an easy listen, but I like it.  The first time I listened to it was in a hospital where I was having a procedure done on my knee.  I had been waiting for hours and was exhausted.  When I got home, I listened to it.  The first time I listened to it, I was about to go to sleep.  I lay in bed for several hours, and when I got up I listened to it again.  When I put it on, I was so relaxed, and I was able to go to sleep.  When I woke up the next morning, I wanted to listen to it again.  The next time I listened to it, I took it off my stereo and put it in my pocket and left it there the rest of the day.  I listened to it the next morning while I was on my way to work and it was a great escape.  It made me smile.  I am a very happy person and I love listening to music.  I thought that this album would be just like one of my favorite albums, "Live at the Royal Albert Hall."  I enjoyed it, but it would not be my favorite.  I would highly recommend this CD.  It would be my first choice if I had any problem with my knee.  I would recommend this to anyone if they were in a situation like I was in.

Amazon review: I was very surprised by this. A good singer and musician.  But I don't really think that much of this.  I like the cover but there are some things that are wrong.
Sentiment: Negative

I love this one.  It's a great rendition.  There are a couple of things that would make this a little better but I think they could probably improve it.  I think the guitar part is a little out of context with the rest of the song.  Maybe add another one for the bridge in the middle of the song, or change it up.  I also like that the song is a little more upbeat and happy.  The melody is a little more cheerful.  If you put a little more emphasis on the upbeat feel of the song it could be a lot better.  I also like that the vocals are softer and more subtle.  It's not the smoothest of vocals but it's good all the same.

Amazon review: I am impressed with the simplicity of this arrangement. This song is one that should have been recorded by the Beatles, but they got it wrong - and rightly so!  The Beatles have a great gift for making music that, whilst in every way simple, is also a challenge to the listener.  This is one of those songs that you can hear a million times and never tire of it.  I am also impressed with the lyrics/melody - both of which must have been inspired by the Beatles, as there is a great deal of similarity in the two.  The Beatles' version is, however, somewhat short on the piano solo, which makes it a bit of a letdown.  This could have benefited from a more detailed piano solo by the author of the song, who would have found such a thing to be quite challenging.  It would also have benefited from the inclusion of, say, a saxophone solo by either one of the Beatles or by someone other than a piano.  This would have created a more complete piece, one which is a bit more exciting and more adventurous.  The lack of this means that I can only listen to this song, for quite a long time, without ever getting bored of it.  The song is a great one, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of this song.  I have listened to this song on the radio a few times, but I could never get it to work on my radio. I thought it was really good, but I could never get it to work.  I think that it needs some more of the instrumentation that the Beatles had and the instrumentation used in the Beatles version of this song is not there in this.  This is a really good song to play on the radio, but I think that it would be better if there was more of the instrumentation that the Beatles had used in the Beatles version which was not there in this version.  Also, it needs more guitar solos in the Beatles version which was not there in this version.

Amazon review: The Dave Clark Five were one of the first bands to create a live rock band sound, and there is still a lot of it to be mined in the 50's-60's.  The guys are a great live draw and they recorded many great songs.  This is one of my favorites from the era.  The band was a bit more polished and less loose, they still have that live rock sound.  This is the best version of the song I have ever heard.  I would listen to every version of this song over and over again.  It is so infectious.  I would buy this CD, I would want to own every one I could get my hands on.

Amazon review: Dave Clark Five:  When I first moved to Memphis, in 1969, it was the Dave Clark Five and the Memphis Horns who introduced me to the blues.  The fact that I am writing this review today almost 50 years later is proof that the Dave Clark Five will not only always be one of my favorite blues bands, but also one of my best friends.  The band was a huge success live, and this is the last time I will ever see them, in Memphis.  I am a fan, and I have seen many of the original members of this band.  The Dave Clark Five was a great group.  I was lucky enough to have seen them live.  I met the band in Atlanta, Georgia, in the early 1970's.  I was there with some friends.  The Dave Clark Five recorded a lot of great songs, and I have many of my favorites on my CD collection.  I have been a fan since 1973, and I am lucky to have found such a great group.  I will always be a fan of the Dave Clark Five, and this is the last time I will ever see them.

Amazon review: I have heard a lot of the Dave Clark Five cd's, and have never been disappointed with them.  This one was one of their best and I wanted to give it a 5 star rating.  But in the end, I have to give it a 3.  It just doesn't live up to the rest of the Dave Clark Five.  This one was a song, and they didn't get much of a chance to do it.  They were a great group and they recorded many great songs, all of which I can still remember.  But this one has to go down as a let down.  I don't think they will ever get there.  It is just not there.

Amazon review: This is a good song, but it's a cover of a song that comes from the 1930s.  It's a song about the meaning of life and it's sad.  It makes you think and it's not a good song.

Amazon review: I'm usually not a fan of cover songs, but this one is actually pretty good.  I like the production and the melody and the vocals.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song rocks, but the original song is even better.  It's a great song and they are both great songs.  I'm not 100 percent sure that she made the original version, but it sounds like it.  I don't know how old the original is, but I like the idea.  I like the way she wrote it and the way the vocals are done.  It's a good song.  I'm sure it's not original.  But I like it and I think it's better than the original version.

Amazon review: This is one of her best songs.  It's a great song and you can tell that she did a great job with it.  It's not a bad song and it has a catchy chorus.  It's a good song and it's a great song.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it sounds like a country song.  But it's definitely a country song, and I think that country is great and I like it.  I would buy this song over most other covers.  It is pretty good and it's a good song.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review (not an album review): This is an excellent album! I bought this CD hoping it was a "re-issue" of another album that I have that has a different artist. However, when I opened the CD and saw the name of the artist it was the same as the artist listed on the CD cover. The CD is "The Music of the Late Eighties". I am guessing there is an error on this CD's packaging. I was under the impression that the artist listed on the cover was one of the artists featured on the CD. In addition, I am not sure this album even has the title of the album the artist is singing on. I'm guessing this is an error on the cover and the CD actually does have this artist, but the name of the CD is listed incorrectly. Overall, this album is very good.

It's been a while since I've heard this song and I liked it so much I went back to the CD and bought the CD because I wanted to play it on it's own.  I liked it so much that I now have bought the CD twice.  It seems like the album is going to be all about this song.  I really like it and I think it's a good song.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Good song, very good song.  The guy singing it has the same voice as the guy in "Gnaw" (which is a great song), and the lyrics and music go so well together.  It was definitely worth the wait.  I was quite impressed with the way he delivered it.

Amazon review: This song is one that I got on the first day of my membership, and I have never gotten out to listen to anything on there until I got that song.  I like it.  I think it's a good song, just not a very good song.  The beat is good, but the verses and chorus are a little disappointing.  I feel like it could be a lot better.  It's a good song, just not a great song.  I think it's a good song, but it's a bit unoriginal.  If you like "Gnaw" then you'll like this.  If you like "Gnaw" then you'll like "Black and Gold."  I think this is a good song, but I don't think it's good enough to make the list.

I was amazed that someone of his caliber would be so fond of the music, and I am also very impressed that he still has it.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

"Nevermind" is the first album to be released under the newly formed record label, Napalm Records, with the release of the group's self-titled debut album. Prior to this release, the band's members were under contract to Epic Records, and in order to receive the album, the band would have had to release a live album as well as a greatest hits album. "Nevermind" is the band's first studio album and was recorded in just three days at their hometown of Seattle, Washington.

"Nevermind" is a fusion of the music of the late 1970s and early 1980s with the music of the 1990s, and features more heavy metal influences than any of the band's previous works.

"Nevermind" was recorded in front of a live audience at the famed Sound City Studios in Seattle, Washington. The album's opening track "Pinion" has become one of the most popular songs of the band's career. The album was released worldwide on June 18, 1993, by Epic Records, and was made available to download on the band's official website.

The album was generally well received, and was awarded a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1994. The band was supported by several major rock acts, including Metallica and Nirvana.

In 2009, Napalm Records was re-formed by singer and guitarist, Scott Ian. Along with new member, Mike Herrera, Ian re-recorded the album and released it in 2010 under the new name "Napalm Records." The re-recorded version of "Nevermind" has been released in the United States and the band is no longer signed to Epic Records.

## The Band

The members of Nirvana were originally from Seattle. They met in their freshman year of high school, and were soon inseparable. The band only lasted until their sophomore year in high school, but they would later continue to write and record together and are now the most popular rock band in the world. The band's debut album, Nevermind, was released in 1991 and it reached number one in over twenty countries. It also topped the Billboard album chart, and in the United States, it reached number one. The band's second album, In Utero, was released in 1994, and peaked at number one.

Nirvana was formed in 1980, when Kurt Cobain moved in with his cousin, Krist Novoselic, and his girlfriend, Courtney Love. Cobain met Novoselic's boyfriend, Dave Grohl, a year later. The four musicians, all from Seattle, formed a band together. The band performed only in Seattle and Cobain's hometown. They released their first two albums independently, but Grohl decided to join the band in 1985. The two songs that made it to the album "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Come as You Are" were written by Grohl. Grohl, who met Cobain in high school, had been in a band with Cobain in high school. He had also been in a band with Novoselic in college, but quit to join the band. Cobain and Novoselic became inseparable and soon Cobain moved in with them.

Nirvana's first album, Nevermind, released in 1991, was recorded in three days, at home. The band members were all students at the University of Washington, but they wrote most of the songs on the album while they were living in Novoselic's apartment. The band's debut was met with positive reviews and even earned a Grammy Award for Best Music Album.

Nirvana's second album, In Utero, was recorded at the famous Sound City Studios in Seattle, and was released on June 10, 1994. The album went platinum (20,000 copies sold) and was certified gold (50,000 copies sold). Nirvana was supported by Nirvana's label, Sub Pop, and performed for their first live shows

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.

Amazon review: I've never liked any of the earlier Hammond albums, but I've listened to this one a lot and enjoy it.  I would prefer if some of the songs had less repetition, perhaps a little more variation.  I'd like to know more about the music and lyrics.  I've found this to be the most interesting of all their records.  I think I'd rather have the best songs than the best production.  I agree with the other reviewers on this one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album and it's a good album, not great.  I've only listened to this album about 3 times.  The songs are very well put together, and they are full of good lyrics.  The best song on the album is "The Day Will Come".  The other songs on the album are OK.  "The Day Will Come" is the only song I like.  I would have preferred more songs on the album.  I would have liked to hear more songs with good lyrics.

A:

I know it is your opinion but I had to give it:

It's a good album, but not great.
It has some good songs and the lyrics aren't that interesting.
Yes, it is a great album, but not the best.
It's not the best of the Hammond albums.
I would like to hear more songs with good lyrics.

A:

I know it is your opinion but I have to give it:

It's a good album, but not the best.
It has some good songs and the lyrics aren't that interesting 

But if you're going to base your opinion on that, then you're in a bit of a pickle.
It's not the best of the Hammond albums.

I'd like to hear more songs with good lyrics.

And what makes that so hard to believe? The lyrics are almost the whole point.
If somebody told me that I couldn't have a song with any lyrics at all, the way some people do, I'd suspect they were trying to pull a fast one.

I don't know how many songs were on this album, but I have
  a feeling that there are at least three songs per side that
  are repeat songs.

That's actually rather interesting. I wonder what percentage of the songs are repeat songs.

A:

It's a good album, but not the best. It's not the best of the Hammond albums.

This is a contradiction. 

It has some good songs and the lyrics aren't that interesting. 

Lyrics are what make the songs interesting. If those lyrics are boring then the songs will be boring.

I would like to hear more songs with good lyrics. And yes, that is why you would want to hear more songs with good lyrics.

And what makes that a contradiction?

Well how many songs were on this album, but I have a feeling that
  there are at least three songs per side that are repeat songs. 

I would love to hear more songs that are not repeat songs. I can think of a few:

"All The Things You Are"
"The Day Will Come"
"Love Is Not Enough"

The song you mentioned is the only one I like. Other than that I have nothing to say.

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.
