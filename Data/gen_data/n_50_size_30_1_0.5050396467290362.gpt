Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: My favorite song is probably the one with the most emotion, "Me Against Me" for a reason.  This album is a collection of songs that I have listened to over and over again and still sound new to me, like I am being introduced to a new group of friends.

Amazon review: the last cd i've ever bought was Dallas Holmgren and his band... (for the life of me i cant remember the name)  But i did like the last cd he did. The music was so nice on it, like it was made for the time. i wish he would make more CDs like this. i mean, he has been around since the 70's and like 90's and he should do more like this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is worth the money to me.  I've listened to it about 5 times.  I like it better than the first CD I've heard.  The last three songs are great.  One of the songs, "Red Hill" is the best song I've heard by Dallas Holm.  If you are looking for a song that is uplifting, this is it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have always owned and enjoyed the Dallas Holm discography, which has been going on for over 30 years.    The sound quality is superb, the album is well made, and the lyrics of the songs are meaningful...  This album is for the listener who can appreciate the more mature compositions, with a more mature sound.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The CD I bought was the first one I heard from Dallas Holm.  I thought it had a good sound.  But over the years I have become more and more critical of the recordings of Holm.    I would not purchase this album because of the CD, but because of the sound quality.  It is a real shame that the recordings of Holm are so inferior.  I've listened to him numerous times, and I still don't think he can make CDs that sound good.   This is just the beginning of the end of Dallas Holm.  I have listened to a few of his recordings and I realize that he is not a good recording artist.    This album is just about as good as it gets for Dallas Holm.  I bought this album and I will listen to it over and over.    This is a great CD and I will continue to buy Dallas Holm's CDs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this album at a physical store for $13.  It is a great CD, but it sounds a little too much like a demo.  I think it would be more interesting if he had recorded more of his original material.    The sound quality is excellent, and the album is well worth the money.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The CD is fine.  It's well made, and the songs are good.  I don't think I'll buy any more of his CDs.  The sound quality is fine, and the songs are good.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.

Amazon review:  This album is fantastic.  The musicianship is amazing, the songwriters are some of the best in the business, and the vocals are top notch.  I got this CD for free just because I was looking for a new artist to listen to and this was the only one that sounded interesting to me.  I was very excited when I heard that Meghan Trainor was going to be the female soloist on the CD and I was right.  The songs are all very different from each other, and I'm not sure which one I like best.  I'm starting to think that I'm going to get my CD at least a month early because I am liking so many of the songs on it.

I like the songs on it more than I like the recording.  I don't know what to say except I don't like it.  It is not worth the money.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Thalia is a talented singer with a voice that is unique. I think the best part about this album is how the instrumentals blend seamlessly with the vocals. This album feels like it was recorded live and the best part is that the vocals are clear and easy to hear.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've been a fan of all of Thalia's music for as long as I can remember. I think this song is one of the greatest she has ever written. She is a singer with a unique voice and musical sensibilities. She really is not afraid to express her emotion through her vocals. Very powerful song.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Thalia's music since high school and I think this is a really great album. I think that this album has a lot of good songs, and I think that she writes very good songs. I like the fact that the songs are very diverse and she has some really good songs, but I think that there are too many songs on the album. Some of the songs are really catchy and some are not. I think that she should have a few better songs on the album such as: Do the Right Thing I believe that she wrote this song because she has a problem with her family. I don't necessarily agree with this song, but I think that it is a good song.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I'll admit, I have a bit of an ear for music, and love all things indie. I bought this album as a gift for my girlfriend for her birthday because it sounded like a good way to introduce her to hip hop music. When I got it, I was surprised to find out that it was a poorly made, rushed, poorly produced and completely over produced album. The album is really over produced and doesn't sound like it was made until the last 20 minutes of the album. The instruments sound like they were recorded in a room with echo, and the vocals sound like they were recorded through a box of Marbles. I would give this album a rating of 1:1 if I could, because it's so over produced and poorly produced, I can't even call it an album.

The song "Can't Keep Me Down" is really bad, and the song "You Can't Do That" is pretty bad. The album is really over produced, and the instruments sound like they were recorded in a room with echo. The songs I like the best are "I'm Ready", "Can't Keep Me Down", "No More", "Pimp", "You Can't Do That" and "It Don't Matter".

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

It's a good selection of music for my work, and for a good price. The only thing that makes me unhappy is the sound quality. It's a good download, but the sound quality is very poor. I can't really hear the vocals on the songs, and the sound is not very good. This is a good download, but it's not a very good download.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

If you're looking for a Christmas song that has a positive message, and you want a good song for the holidays, you might like this one. 

 "It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"

Music:

 

Lyrics:

I believe that if one reads this review one will understand the reason I am writing it. It is NOT a review of the album. It is me just stating my opinion. The reason I am writing this is because I am very passionate about anything and everything that I stand for. So, I am going to take a risk and write a review of the artist.

I have been a fan of T-Pain since the day he was born and became a full member of T-Pain's crew. His style is unique and his music is fun. The most important thing about him is that he has a great attitude to his music. He has the potential to be a huge star because of how great his music is. I can tell that he is going to succeed in whatever he is doing. However, people have to be careful. I have heard that he has a lot of problems in his life and he is getting into trouble. I hope that he gets back on track and gets his act together. It is sad to see somebody so young get into so much trouble. I have no love in any of his songs. If you are a fan of T-Pain, he is the best artist you can find. He is worth it. I am glad to be a part of the T-Pain family. I am here today to tell you that you are wrong about him. He is not a drug abuser, he is not a gang member, he is not a drug dealer. He is just a normal guy who has a really great attitude and a great heart to his music. He has a lot of potential to be a great artist. He is worth it.

This album will be a great hit for all the people who love the style of the T-Pain crew. It will give them a lot of money and attention because of the quality of the music. The way they are playing the drums is very cool. The way they are singing and rapping is very cool. It has a very easy to understand and listen to musical style.

This will be a great album for the people who like a smooth and easy going music. It is a great album to listen to and it is very easy to understand.

I am not a fan of T-Pain because he is a member of the T-Pain gang. However, if you like the T-Pain crew, this will be a great album. It is an easy listen and a very good album to listen to. I hope that this album is a hit for the T-Pain crew and they will get a lot of money for it. I hope that they will win the Grammy award for Best R&B album.

I am not completely against the T-Pain gang. The music is very good and it is easy to understand. However, they have to be careful. They have to be very careful because they have a lot of problems outside of the gang. I hope that they get a good job soon. I hope that they get a good job and they get their act together. I hope that this album is a hit for the T-Pain gang. I hope that they get a lot of money for it. I hope that they get a lot of attention for this album and they have a lot of fans. I hope that this album is a hit for the T-Pain band and they will get a lot of attention for it. I hope that they get a lot of money for it. I am not a fan of T-Pain because he is a member of T-Pain's crew. However, if you like the T-Pain crew, this album will be a great album to listen to and it is very easy to understand. I hope that this album is a hit for the T-Pain song and they will get a lot of money for it. I hope that the T-Pain song will be a hit for the T-Pain crew and they will get a lot for it. I hope that the T-Pain song will be a great hit for the T-Pain crew and they will get a lot of attention for it. I hope that the T-Pain song will be a good hit for the T-Pain crew and they will get a lot of fans for it. I hope that the T-Pain song will be a big hit for the T-Pain gang and they will

Thalia was the first artist I heard in my life that has great songs.  I have always loved her voice.  I love the songs she sings.  I love the songs they sing.  This album is great.  I just wish they would put more effort into this album.

Thalia's Greatest hits (3)
This is by far my favorite album.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
