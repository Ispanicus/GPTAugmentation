Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I had seen this album on iTunes and Amazon a few days ago.  I bought it and listened to it today just to see what it was.  When I got home and listened to it, I was shocked!  The way she sings is so beautiful.  I fell in love with her and bought this album immediately.

I am a huge Ray Benson fan, and have been one for years. I am not a huge fan of the original western swing compilation, however I have been waiting for years to hear Ray's new album.
This is the first western swing album that I have heard that I would put on in the car.
I can only imagine what type of record collection this has already put together.
This is the second CD that I have purchased and I have to say, it is a must have for any western swing fan.
I love the original western swing compilation, and I love Ray's music, but this is so much better and the collection of songs and albums that he has put together is truly amazing.
This album is worth the $150.00 on Amazon. It's definitely worth the investment.
I have listened to this album more than a few times.
I would recommend it to any western swing fan.
I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who loves western swing music.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I'm not really a fan of this new singer/songwriter.  I don't think I can go out and buy all that new music without having a little bit of an interest, but she has that weird vocal-thing going where she sounds like she's gargling a mouthful of sour milk.  I don't know her background, but I'm guessing she's from the UK, and I don't know, I just don't like her.

Amazon review: I love the idea of being able to sing and dance in the same song.  The vocals are great. The music is good.  I like it a lot.  However, I feel like the lyrics are a little simplistic.  I don't know why I feel that way.  I like the song.  I just wish the words were more complex.  This is a good CD.  I think it could be a really good CD.  It could stand out from the rest of the CD by having a more complex lyrical structure.  It's just the way it is.  I wish there was more complexity in the lyrics.

Amazon review: I think this really is the best song on the CD.  I love the chorus and the lyrics.  I think it's a really great song, but this song is a little too fast.

Amazon review:  The singing and singing and singing for Jesus is overrated.  It's kind of like hearing a bunch of college students get together and sing "I will have your baby." 

I'm not a Christian, but I do listen to Christian radio stations.  I like some of the Christian radio (not all, but I like some of them).  I've listened to a lot of Christian music over the years,  but this one song got me.  I think I was 15 years old when I first heard this song,  I listened to it every night on my transistor radio.  It was my favorite song of all time,  and I listened to it again and again,  it still holds up to this day.  I still love this song.  I've been listening to it for about 30 years,  and I've always wondered why the song wasn't on the Christian radio stations,  and why it was not on the Christian TV stations.  I've always wondered why it wasn't on any of the Christian TV stations,  I think God got tired of hearing it all the time and decided to give it to me.  It's funny,  I never thought I could believe this was a Christian song,  but I never thought it was a Christian song,  but I do.

Amazon review: I'm a "fan" of this band from the 60's to the 90's... and I'm not really a singer, but I've been listening to this music more than the past few years, and I'm just getting to the point now where I can tell that this is a good band (but not the best of the 60's-70's-80's-90's, obviously). I think the songs are good, but I'm not really feeling the energy in the band. I love the old songs, but I'm not sure how the newer songs are going to hold up in the future. I think the best songs are:  All in Love (or Love is All You),  I Feel Good,  I've Got a Message For You,  I Can't Stop Now,  I've Been Looking for You,  Get Off Of My Cloud,  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green, I Feel Good,  I've Got a Message For You,  Love Is All You,  I've Been Looking for You,  I've Got a Message For You,  Love is All You,  What's Up With That,  I Feel Good,  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little, I Feel Good,  Get Off Of My Cloud,  I've Been Looking for You,  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little You,  Get Off Of My Cloud,  I've Been Looking for,  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little (Loved it!!)

Amazon review: I love the music from the early 70's, especially from this group. I am not a musician but I have been listening to this for a few years. I love the way they sound. This group has got some great tunes. They sound like the Beatles and The Coasters...but they are way better. I love the old rock/pop songs, and the old jazz songs are great. They are pretty funny. I do not like it when there is too much background music, but when there is just one instrument I like it. I think this band sounds great. I love this group. The band has a good sound, and I like the old songs, but I would like to hear some new songs. I was really looking forward to the 90's music. I love the Beatles, The Bee Gees, The Beach Boys, and The Coasters. I hope you can find some good new songs!

Amazon review: I love the first 4 or 5 songs of this album (I don't know why I love them so much). It is amazing how much they have changed within the past 10 years. I remember when this band first came on the scene, the music was so good. I am glad they have come back to the music scene.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

From the CD, "The Best of the Best"  
I don't know about others, but I've always listened to this CD for the most part.  
I think that I've never been able to find the kind of quality that exists in this CD.  You go through the entire album, listening for the moment when the voice really brings the listener into the world of the singer.  
There are some people that can bring it, but for the most part, I've always been able to bring it into my world.  I think this is only a matter of time before the people that can really bring it to the world will be made available to everyone.

I'm a little sad to say that I've stopped listening to this artist.  I don't know if I'm just not in the right headspace for some of the songs, but she's become very repetitive.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Ray Benson, a one-time member of the New Orleans Rhythm & Blues Society, is an internationally acclaimed guitarist, composer, and producer whose recordings have been featured on records by the Beatles, Neil Young, Neil Diamond, John Mellencamp, and many others. In recent years, Benson has released several CDs of original music in collaboration with other artists--notably, with the group The New Orleans Jazz Orchestra--and has released three solo albums, most notably his 2009 release, The Blues Man (which won the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Musical Album, Non-Classical).
Benson's career has been marked by a keen sense of humor and a powerful, heartfelt appreciation of the music and culture of the Crescent City. Benson has toured extensively around the world, playing shows in front of sold-out crowds, and has collaborated with some of the world's most influential artists, including Jack White, The Rolling Stones, and R.E.M. He is currently working on new music, and in the meantime, Benson has released the lead single from his upcoming album, "Back in the Bottle," on his own label, Music & Arts.
Benson's voice is the unmistakable sound of an exceptional performer who has been influenced by great masters of blues and jazz, such as Muddy Waters, Mose Allison, and Muddy Waters. His playing has been widely praised as "possessive, yet lighthearted, with a touch of humor." He has been described as "a musician of extraordinary talent and a master of the guitar's more subtle nuance."
Benson has won multiple awards and accolades for his career, including three Grammy Awards: Best Rock Instrumental Performance, Album of the Year (Eighth Grade); Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male (Riding with the Wind); and Best Rock Song, "I'm Your Hooch" (The Blues Man). Benson's songwriting has been covered by many artists, including Jack White, The Rolling Stones, and R.E.(Eminem).
For Benson, music is not a means to an end, but a way of life. "I like music to make me happy. It makes me happy when I'm happy, and it makes me happy when I'm sad."
--Ray Benson
Benson has had a long and varied career in music. As a member of the New Orleans Rhythm & Blues Society, he toured with the likes of Buddy Guy, Junior Kimbrough, David Houston, and Johnny Adams, and released a series of albums on his own label, Music & Arts. In 1994, Benson released his debut solo album, The Blues Man, which won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Album, Non-Classical.
The Blues Man was followed by two more solo albums, 1996's The Bluesman, and 1998's The Bluesman, both of which were nominated for Grammy Awards.
In 2006, Benson released another album with The New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, Live at the Half Note, a live recording from a sold-out concert at the Half Note in New Orleans that was released on CD and DVD.
From 1998 to 2003, Benson toured with The Rolling Stones. In 2005, he joined Neil Young's band on their North American tour, and in 2006, he released Blue Notes, a live album recorded at the Isle of Wight Festival.
Benson also has released several CDs of original music, including The Jazz of Ray Benson (1998), A Tribute to Muddy Waters (2000), Muddy Waters: The Complete Sessions (2003), and Live from the Bottom Line (2004).
Benson has written and recorded with many other artists, including Jack White, The Rolling Stones, and R.E.'s.
He has received three Grammy Award nominations for his work, including Best Rock Instrumental Performance, Album of the Year (Eighth Grade) and Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male (Riding with the Wind), as well as the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song, "I'm Your Hooch" (The Bluesman, from The Bluesman).
Benson started writing songs at least as early as high school. His first composition was "We're All in This Together," written when he was 15, and the song was performed on a local radio station in New Orleans, where he was visiting his grandfather.
Benson developed a lifelong

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: A little bit of my favorite artists are on this album except for Michael Jackson, who is on another album. I love Michael Jackson, but I have to say, this is not Michael Jackson.

Amazon review: I have to admit that I am not very familiar with Lin Manuel Miranda's music. However, I do know a little bit about him. The first time I heard this album, I thought, wow, it sounds very similar to his music. His music is very different from Michael Jackson's, and I was curious to find out more about this artist. This album is very good, but I have to say that this is not the best album that I have ever heard. The music is beautiful. I have no complaints about that. However, the album is very short and I would have liked to have heard a lot more. I would rate this album 4.5 stars out of 5.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I've had a lot of different teachers and this is the first time I've really tried something different.  I had heard of John Dolby and thought he was a great teacher, but he didn't really take the time to explain what I was doing and the lesson went from fun to monotonous.  The lesson was very short and the teacher is not very clear on what he wants or does not want me to do.  He tells me what he doesn't like about me and then I do it and he gives me some other exercises.  I didn't get any new techniques from the lessons and I never got any new techniques to use.  I thought he was very nice and I was able to ask him some questions that I hadn't thought of.  I don't think I'm going to pay him $300 to come back for another lesson.  If he wants to do lessons again then maybe I can get him to show me how to make it more fun, but I think I'll just go with my own ideas.  I really hope he keeps doing the lessons and not just give me generic instructions.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Don't let the title fool you, this is a great album.  I loved the song "New York City" so much that I went back and bought the whole CD.  The voice is amazing and I like the way she sings the songs.  The other songs I would only say that they are good but not great.  I bought a few of them to see if I could learn them and they don't stand up.  I think they are good but I don't think I could put it on a CD and sing along with it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this album because it had good reviews and it had the best songs in the whole CD.  It's great, but I don't like the way the songs are arranged.  I like the songs and the way the vocals are combined, but there's nothing special about there.  Overall, I think it's a good CD but I don't think it'll take me anywhere.  If you like it then I'm sure you'll enjoy it, but I think it's just not that good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've always had a love affair for any type of female vocal.  I love all the girls in the groups from TLC to Alicia Keys to Britney Spears.  I always liked their voices and even when they were not singing for the first time they sang a lot for their first performance.  I've bought a couple of groups that I thought were really good; I thought that C+C Music Factory from the early 90's was amazing, but I have no idea how they made it to be number one on the Billboard charts.  I really like the song "I Luh Ya Papi" but I think it's one of their best.  The other songs (Crazy In Love, I'm In Love, and Stay) are OK, but nothing amazing.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album that will get you out there and start working on your own singing.  All the songs are different, as you would expect from a group, and they are all great.  The song "Good Vibrations" is my favorite and will become a staple in my repertoire.  The other songs are fine, but not great; but I am guessing they don't have many more songs that are like this.  I think this CD will take me to the next level.  The vocals are great.

Amazon review: This is one of the best female vocal groups in the world.  They sing great and have a pretty good voice.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

It's just a lot more "rock" that I don't like.  I don't know, I don't think I'll like the next album from her.  Maybe I'll like this one better.  I'm not sure.  I just don't like it.
