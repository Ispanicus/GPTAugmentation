Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: This song is the definition of a classic.  It has been on my iPod for the past 8 years and I have never really heard it.

So, in the end, I am glad I listened to this song.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: The CD was damaged in shipping.  It arrived in a plastic container with the CD inside, and did not come with a case.  I asked for it to be sent back to me in a case, which I was told was not available.  I did not expect the product to arrive with all the packaging, but I have a reasonable expectation that the product will be protected and in a safe package.  I do not expect to be compensated anything for this item.  I am not a fan of these companies, so I will not support them by buying their products.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because it had a special request from a friend.  They want to listen to the album but not hear the songs.  I love the tracks, but they were the most annoying songs on this CD.  The tracks are all over the place, but there are a few exceptions.  For example, the last song on the album is "The Way It Is", which is a great song to listen to.  Also, the first track on the album (which I have a lot of) is "The World Keeps Going", which is a great song to listen to.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I'm glad I've finally realized that I'm not alone in my disdain for this song. It's an abomination. I've listened to it so many times I cannot believe I'm still reviewing it.

So embarrassing.

###
Amazon review: So true. I've been wanting to write an Amazon review for this song ever since I first heard it. Well, I've finally done it. I think I've finally figured out why the song brings back so many memories for me. It's because it made me realize that everything you think you know about the 90's is a lie. In a way the 90's were the last generation of people who believed in the lie that everything you see on the news is true. There isn't one person alive who remembers seeing the Twin Towers fall on September 11, 2001. There is no person alive who remembers the war in Iraq. There is no person alive who remembers the attacks on the World Trade Center or the Pentagon. The entire world has been lied to for the past 17 years. The entire world never saw the aftermath of 9/11. There is no person alive who remembers Pearl Harbor or the attack on the USS Maine. There is no person alive who remembers the attack on the USS Vincennes. There is no person alive who remembers the attack on the USS Liberty. There is no person alive who remembers the attack on Flight 93 or the attacks on the USS Cole. There is no person alive who remembers the attacks on the USS Enterprise or the USS Intrepid. There is no person alive who remembers the attacks on the USS Independence or the USS Monitor. There is no person alive who remembers the attacks on the USS Yorktown or the USS Saratoga.

Amazon review: My wife and I were watching a show on television the other night and the commercial for this song came on. We both said "Yeah!" without thinking. My wife said "I'm glad you like it." I said "Yes, I do like it." She said "There's no such thing as bad publicity." I said "Yes, there's a lot of publicity." She said "You've got to be kidding me." I said "No, that's the way it is." She said "Well, then, can I try it?" I said "Sure. We'll have to buy some beer." The show started and her "Yeah!" was cut short and she said "I love it," and I said "Yes, you do."

This is my favorite CD  of all time but I don't know why I don't own more of it.  I love how he wrote about his life and what he has overcome. I have been struggling a little to understand the faith that he has for the past few years  and to be able to have the courage to go to where he is and face his fears.

Bible Verses for Monday, September 19, 2013

(Ps. 49:7)

1. "Be not afraid of evil, nor of the consequences that may come from it. For evil is only temporary, and the time of retribution is forever" (Prov. 16:4).
No, he is not quoting the Psalms of Jesus to be scared of anything. He is quoting it to encourage us to not be afraid of sin and the consequences of sin.
2. "There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear" (1 Cor. 13:8).
Here he is teaching us that perfect love casteth out fear.
3. "I will not be afraid of the terror by night; nor of the arrow that flieth by day. I will be very confident, for I am the Lord. My God shall supply all my need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus" (Job 23:14-15).
This is a very reassuring statement. It means that Jesus is going to be there for us.
4. "I have sworn by my holiness that I will not fail to love you, my adopted children, as long as I live" (John 14:21).
This is a promise to us that we will always be loved by God.
5. "Love is the only way" (1 Cor. 13:12).
This is one of the most beautiful verses in the Bible.
6. "A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good, and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth evil" (Matthew 12:33).
This is one of my favorite verses in the Bible.
7. "A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bring forth good, and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his bad heart bringeth forth evil" (Matthew 12:33).
This one is very bad. He is teaching us that God is a very bad teacher and that we will only be good if we are the good man.
8. "For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world,

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The asinine politics gets in the way of the music. I listened to this CD at a neighborhood party and had to comment. I would not consider buying it even though Ry Cooder has enormous MUSICAL talent and I have some of his other editions. Hey Ry, stick to music for everyone.

Amazon review: This is the greatest CD I've ever heard. I'm not kidding.  After listening to this CD for about 4 hours, I feel like I'm in a dream. It's like a movie playing in my head and I can't wake up. I'm having the most amazing dream that I've ever had and I can't wake up. I'm so happy.  I feel like I'm experiencing love for the first time in my life! (I'm not kidding.)  I've listened to this CD hundreds of times over the past two months and I can't get it out of my head.  The whole album is amazing and I can't stop listening to it.  I hope you enjoy it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song is fantastic.  This is one of those albums where you just go back and listen to it over and over again without really realizing you've already heard a good deal of it.  At times it almost feels like you're listening to the same song over and over again.  It's like being in a constant state of music.  In this case, it almost feels like you're listening to one song over and over again.  You can't help but get sucked into the emotion and passion of this music.  There are some great tracks.  I'm not going to go into detail about them, but there are quite a few gems.  If you don't like it, I apologize.  I didn't even know there was much that wasn't great about this album.  If you enjoy it, then let me know.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like this album.  The album sounds like it was recorded in a basement.  There are a few songs on there that I really like, but the majority of the album is pretty average.  It's not that bad of an album, but it's not a very good one.  Overall, it's a good album for people who like a somewhat obscure kind of music.  There are a few songs that are better than others, but they're not that special.  The only real thing that saves this album from a 5 star rating is that the music is very good.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: The music has a lot of soul and a lot of melody. I can't see anything bad about this band. The lyrics are beautiful (some are very heavy, but I think they're only because they're very deep). The band has some great songs, some great instrumentals, and some great vocals. It's not a party band, but it's not a party either. I like this band.
