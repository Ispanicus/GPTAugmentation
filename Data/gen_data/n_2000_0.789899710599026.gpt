Amazon review: I don't know if it's Amazon's fault, but it seems like the sound mixing on the MP3 is bad.  Too much treble, muddy in the midrange, and the bass is lacking, or maybe it's just overshadowed by the treble.  Listening to this track on my regular speakers does not normally make my ears- literally, not figuratively- hurt.  I'm so thankful for programs like Audacity (sound manipulation program) so I can balance it out myself, but I shouldn't have to.

Amazon review: The music is wonderful and the voice is fantastic. It's a different feel than most other versions.  Although my son loves the music, I wouldn't turn it off when he's asleep and I wouldn't use it in the background.  I would use it to help the transition to sleep time.  It might help with the transition but it doesn't help in the case of a real child with a real life.  I was hoping it would help.

Amazon review: I've been a Dylan fan from way back.  And, I'm also a big Sinatra fan.  I write this review from that perspective.  What has happened to American culture, that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this CD is getting such praise from reviewers?  Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?  Anyone who praises this CD necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of Sinatra, and how he did these songs.  And I'm tired of performers who have no voice at all, getting by, because they are supposedly "emoting.

Amazon review: I don't know where else to complain about this but every time this song comes on, I cringe and die a little inside. It's got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying songs of all time.

Amazon review: This is a very good CD, but what's annoying is that the CD was put together by a guy who should be the next Dylan.  I'm not going to listen to this song because of the way it sounds.  It's a shame he didn't get to do what he should have done.  And his version is awful.  The song is too long, the lyrics are written in a way that makes them not very catchy, and the vocals are a little off.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very good cd.  I think his voice is excellent.  And the songs are great.  He even sings a little of those Sinatra classics that were so hard to sing 20 years ago.  For the most part, I don't think he's trying too hard.  This is a good cd.

Amazon review: A good song but I don't think it has any merit.  This song is very nice.  But, when I sing this song I just can't help but think how uninspired the lyrics are.

There are many other songs that are more enjoyable.  This song is very pleasant but not excellent.

Amazon review: I have a vynil copy of that album, and won't buy the CD, cause there are much better options to waste money! "Zipper" is a strange album of an artist that was a great star during the early-mid 70's, but during the Disco and the "New wave", turned to be irrelevant. His worst album "Lace and whiskey" and "Zipper" are strange experiences to make a come-back, but he had to wait few more years. "Zipper" reminds us sometimes the classic Alice of "Love it to death", "School's out" etc.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).

Amazon review: Sounded like a Mexican band; not country; not my style.  Every song sounded the same; no variety.  If you're looking for country, this isn't for you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The only reason this CD is a "hit" is because of the name of its lead singer.    This group has an attitude that's right on the edge of what I consider to be the borderline of what's acceptable for the music world.  When I buy an album that's not well written or produced I expect more than what I received from this album.  The band's attitude is similar to that of the Riff Raff  crowd. Their songs aren't bad, but they don't have the unique twist of personality that would make any of them stand out from the crowd.   I'll be buying their next album, but I won't be buying this one.

Amazon review: I'm not usually a fan of country music.  But this album,  The New Yankee Musician, is my kind of country.  I've never been a fan of the "new school" country genre, which is why I went into the iTunes store to buy I'm Not There.  I didn't find it on my first play-through, and I didn't have the money to spend on iTunes to download it.  So I went back to the tape, and I have to say I am glad I did.  Not only is it a great record; it's the best country I've heard in quite a while.  I can't begin to tell you how much I love the way this band approaches their songs.   I believe that if this band played any other style of country music, their songs would sound dated and overplayed.   The New Yankee Musician is a great album, and I'm very glad I bought it.      I'm hoping they do another album.

Amazon review: I've been waiting for this record since the late 1990's.   It's a really good album.  I love the way the vocals sound, and I just wish that there was more variety to the songs.     My favorite song is 'The Long-Distance Runner' which is a song that just makes me want to listen to it all day.  I've been listening to it for days now.  I've been listening to it every morning since I bought it.   It's also really good that there are so many different versions of the album.   I have the original version, as well as a version that has the same song, but with different lyrics.   I love that the songs can be used to tell a story.  The songs on this album are just beautiful.      I would recommend this album to anyone who likes a little bit of country music.    I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of the old-school country music style.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have only one problem with this album.    I'm not a fan of the way the vocals sound on the second half of the album.  The vocals are really bad on all of the songs.    I don't like the way singer/songwriter Jonathan "Bucky" Bush's voice sounds.  I don't think it's his best voice, and I think it's not his best voice.    I don't like any of the singers.  I don't like any of them.    I don't like the way they sound.     I'm not a fan of country music, but I really like this album.    It's not my style, but it's really good.  It's my kind of country music.     I'm glad I bought it and I recommend it to anyone who likes a little bit of country music.

Amazon review: I don't know where else to complain about this but every time this song comes on, I cringe and die a little inside. It's got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying songs of all time.  Aside from the fact that the song consists of 4 lines of lyrics with no substance, they "borrow" the can-can song and make it even more irritating.

I was looking around for a cheap phone and this was the only one that I found to be worth it.

Amazon review: It's not the original version, but he gets close to it.  I had heard this song back in 1993 and was very moved by the lyrics. I inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it.  I finally was able to google it (2010) and found the exact song by Eddy Grant.  The song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color.  Great song and powerful message, a must listen for the cultural sensitive person.

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.  The sound file looks like a brick.  This type of remaster is what gives digital sound a bad name and makes people long for vinyl.  It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!

Amazon review: Uggg, another christmas cd from Leann Rimes.  You are watching the decline of what used to be a great country voice.  It is sad to watch all her projects fail and then she trots herself out for any publicity she can get for another Christmas album.  People put out Christmas music when their careers are failing.  Leann used to have a great voice and was a likable talent.  Not anymore.  I cannot understand  the words she is singing and the album is not very good.

Amazon review: I decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing "Too Close" on different commercials and researching Alex Clare.  He's an interesting person with a unique, soulful voice and I figured that this album would not disappoint.  This has been one of the best albums that I've ever purchased to date.  Every song is different but exceptional too, especially "Hands Are Clever."  "Hummingbird" uses a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pairs this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus, whereas "Up All Night" is a rock anthem to evening activities.

Amazon review: I agree with the two other reviews saying Stills is tired here.  Nothing is inspiring here and Stills looks like he is going thru the motions.  His guitar solos are good, however  his voice sounds weak (due to age I guess) and I was tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band.  I think he should just stay with CSN where he still shines around his fellow singers Crosby and Nash.  He lacks the inspiration playing with his band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Definitely not his best work. songs either to rap or slow. nothing like his last 2 albums.  It has to grow on me or a big waste of money.

###
Amazon review: I heard this first on the radio and liked it.  I think it's a good album but I'm not sure it's the best.  My favorite song is "When I Need You" which is the best song on this album.  The others I think are ok but not great.  There is a lot of filler and it gets repetitive after a while.  I think he should focus more on his guitar and piano and do more live shows with the band.  Maybe take off a couple of songs from his old albums and add a few to this one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not a bad album by any means.  I listened to it in the car and I don't care for it that much but I do like the songs.  The vocals are okay and it has a good feel to it.  The only problem is that I don't like the lyrics.  They are all about the same thing and that is a problem.  I can't figure out what he's saying.  I don't like when a musician makes a song about something and I don't mind when they do something completely different.  The only thing I don't like is that he's trying to be too hip but he's not.  Some songs just need a drummer/bass player to make them better.  I don't think he's great but he's okay.  I think he should do more live shows in a small club like the Bitter End.  I don't think he's a great singer but he's ok.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very happy to find this album on Amazon.  It's not as good as CSN but it is a good album.  I like the songs, but I don't like the lyrics.  It's like he's singing the lyrics over and over again.  He makes the lyrics sound like he's singing them to himself.  It's not like he's singing them to the crowd.  He's singing them to himself and I don't like it.  I like some of the other songs but they sound like they had to be written over and over again.  "No Need to Go Home" is one of the worst songs.  It's on the same album that is the best song "When I Need You."  The other songs are ok.  I'd like to have heard a couple of other songs from this album.  He's got a lot of material on this album but it's not that great.  I don't think he should do any more live shows.  I like the old songs better.  I'd like to hear a couple of new songs from him.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you like the other albums by CSN and CSN-era Liza he should do a couple of live shows, and if you like the other albums and live shows by CSN he should do more.  He doesn't need to do any more live shows.

Amazon review: This is a great album!  It has the old feel that everybody loves, and a few new songs.  I like that he's keeping the old style, but I also like that he's keeping the new style, too.  The songs are good, and he does some different things on this one, and he does that a lot in the old songs.  This is a great album and I hope he does more new songs and live shows.  He's been a great artist and musician for well over 20 years now.  It's time for him to do some new music.

Amazon review: This is not a great album.  It's not great musically or lyrically.  The music is good but the lyrics are horrible.  When I started listening to this album, I was hoping for some new songs.  These songs are all over the place, and it's not enough to just listen to the music or the lyrics.  It's not enough to just listen to the songs.  I wish he would do more live shows because the album is not good.  There are some good songs here and some bad songs.  He should get new songs from other artists.  He should at least do one live show with his band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review; I agree with the other two reviews.  It's not good at all.  It's not a great album and you can tell.  His voice is not good, it sounds like he's on the verge of death.

Amazon review: I feel like a traitor saying this, but I won't be buying this set any time soon.  I stand second-to-none in my affection for the band, but unfortunately, this "career-spanning retrospective" is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 years of that recording career.  By my count, there are only about five songs on this set that were released after 1980.  Not good enough.  Capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a Beach Boys compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered songs, and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Beach Boys since 1969, and have played this album over and over again.  I have also been waiting for this CD!

Amazon review: I'm a fan of many different bands and I'm going to start a collection of music that I like. But if I add the Beach Boys to that collection I will have to buy a CD.

Amazon review: I have been a fan for many years and this is without a doubt the greatest Beach Boys album I have ever heard.  The most important thing about this album is that it is the most accurately recorded album of any of the bands that have ever existed.  The quality is so high that it is impossible to tell whether or not the boys were playing the instruments and how many people were in the studio, or whether there were 3 or 4 different persons recording this album with different instruments and different voices.  To me this is the most important thing about this album.  The other things are all very nice.  I am not sure what I would have done without the "long time" on this album.  I may have not sold my car. I may have not gone to college.

Amazon review: Since I have been a fan since I was a teenager I bought this album over 20 years ago.  I have played it over and over and over again, and now this CD is the best album I have ever obtained.  It is an amazing CD and I do not know how I lived without it for so long.

Amazon review: I was not a fan of the Beatles but I was a fan of the Beach Boys.  This is the only album that I have owned that the boys recorded.  I had the songs on a cassette tape and then I had it on CD.  I would listen to it over and over again.  I knew when I first bought this album that I was going to make this album my album of the year.  I am so happy that this album is finally here.  This is the best Beach Boys album on the CD market.  I would have never imagined a CD I was never able to get from radio. This album is an amazing album that needs to be played over and over.  This is my favorite Beach Boys album.

Amazon review: It's hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard.  There are so many worthy candidates.  Big Star's 'Radio City' gets mentioned a lot.  T.Rex's 'Electric Warrior' comes to mind.  But the frontrunner from the '90s has got to be Mezzanine, a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant.  Destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison.

It's been a while since I've posted.
I've been busy with school and just couldn't get in the mood to put some music up.  But now that I'm back, it's time to get back into the swing of things.  This week, I have a new playlist.

Amazon.com Review

The first CD I bought after I got my first car, the second CDI bought when my husband gave me the first CD, and the third CDI bought when I saw the song "I Will Always Love You" byFleetwood Mac.

I believe in music. I believe that good music should be shared, enjoyed and preserved. AllMusicReview says: "This is a great song, and I actually like it better than "Drivemy car" and "I Want to hold Your Hand." I also like "Best is yet to come" better than "You've Got a Friend." "

I really liked this CD, except for the beginning. Then, I was like, "I like it, but I don't like the beginning."

What I like about this CD is that the songs are positive and uplifting. That they make you feel good. They feel good. And, there's no harm or criticism in them.

The cracking noises make it almost unlistenable, completely unworthy of the quality of GMO's fine session.  You can hear the crackles in the preview - yes, it's that bad and worse all the way through.

Amazon review: Huge WZ and RZ here. This album is a bit disappointing. Some have equated it to an EP and I agree. I believe Rob is believing any crap he puts out there is "cool", well. It ain't. Love John 5's playing and hope Rob puts out more serious lyrics and music next time.

Amazon review: This is a great album, but not quite the same as RZ.  This is a very different album.  The only thing keeping it from being better is the fact that it is only available as a digital download, and that it is not a digital download.

Amazon review: I love Terrance and his acting is superb.  He just can not sing but he can really play the guitar.  I paid 13.00 for the CD and there were only 2 songs i played a little.  I enjoyed the spanish type song.  Maybe if he was able to sing more soulful. Anyway don't pay the CD, but I love you Terrance you are one of my fav actors.

Amazon reviewer: Terrance is a talented guitarist but his voice was not up to par. I do not understand how he can not be able to sing on his own and play his guitar.

Amazon review: I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the "best album."  I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances.  The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.)  And the production quality is not great either- you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the most overrated, overhyped, overpraised, annoying band in history!  The intense praise this band gets is downright sickening.  How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

Amazon review: first off i wanna address something prior to my review. east. 187 why would you say such a horrible thing calling 2pac "wack". that's blasphemy right there. he was as real as it gets, he had quite a few positive songs, and he was one of the greatest! anyone would agree with me there. on to my review of this cd. i weep at the current state of hip hop. how did we go from notorious big to lil flip? hip hop has taken a huge plunge in terms of its lyrical prowess and it's pathetic.

Amazon review: i never really liked 2pac but after listening to this song (I know it's not his best but this song is catchy) I can see how he could get fans, but it's really sad to even hear him make remarks about a woman that he was dating and how he found her attractive. what a waste. this is a song about the current state of hip hop. it's not the worst song on here, but it really isn't anything to get excited about. this cd doesn't make me feel any better either. i guess that's why it was put on the list.

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Amazon review: There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'.

The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed in this, as it was the only one of the 'Flesh Trade' releases I had not heard before. I expected something a little more ambitious than the usual 'rockumentary' style. I've heard of a lot of the bands on the Flesh Trade roster, but I had not heard of any of them. I liked the music, and thought the band were great. I still think that. But the editing was very poor. There was no attempt at making it more of a documentary than a rockumentary. I would have been better served to see the bands perform live, and to get a live version of 'Rock' (the title track) from the concert DVD.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the Cure, and this is the only DVD I have seen of them. I really enjoyed it. I think, however, the sound is pretty poor. There is what sounds like a static noise when the band is playing the guitar parts. I have not heard this sound before. I'm not sure if the band played the guitar parts at all in this recording. I think that the sound was probably made at a studio. After listening to it, I thought that this would be a great documentary to show my friends and family. However, I was mistaken. This is a great documentary, but it could have been better. I would have liked to hear the Cure live. I think they would have been better live than as recorded and edited.

Amazon review: I purchased the Live At Leeds DVD in order to record and edit a film of the band, but found the sound quality so poor that I cancelled the order. It was the second DVD I had bought from Amazon. I would never buy a DVD again as the audio is so poor and the video is so poor that it is pointless recording and playing back the music. The music is very mediocre and I feel the editing has been poor as well, which makes the whole thing very poor and boring. I would never purchase another music DVD from Amazon again.

Amazon review: This is a great album from the 80's. I love the music on this album by the band, so I bought this on the CD. It is a great album for those who love 70's and 80's hair metal.

However, I still enjoyed the album due to the great music and the great vocals.

Amazon review: I recently heard the new music by the band, and was really excited to hear the new songs on the album. I wish I had purchased this album when it was first released a few years ago. I purchased the album on CD at a local record store, and was happy to have it delivered to my house. It arrived quickly, and I had it in my CD player in less than a week. After listening to a number of the songs, I decided to purchase the album on CD. Then, when I got home, I noticed that it was a digital download of the album on Amazon.com. When I got home, I went online and purchased the album on CD at a local record store. When the CD arrived, it was a digital download on Amazon.com. I was very upset that I wasted $15 of my money. I could have purchased the album on CD from the same store, and it would have been delivered to my house and ready for me to listen to it immediately. I would have never wasted my money on a CD and an Amazon.com download. This is a waste of money for me, and for anyone else who purchases an album from Amazon.com. I suggest that people buy their albums from the store that they buy music from, and not from the Amazon.com store. My wife had no problem with the music on the CD, so I should have no problem with the album downloaded through Amazon. It is a waste of money, and a complete waste of time as well. I would not recommend purchasing this album.
