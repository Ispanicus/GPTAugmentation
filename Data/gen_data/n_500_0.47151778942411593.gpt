Amazon review: We are all going through great changes.  This album seems to be taking the same approach as most of the other artists.  I get tired of all the pretense and self-indulgence.

Amazon review: I was really excited to buy this CD.  I was looking forward to listening to it.  But after listening to it, I didn't like it.  The music is all very fast paced and has been sped up so much that it is almost unrecognizable.  I can't believe that there are people who listen to this type of music.  Please get back to me so I can find somebody who can make me feel better about the music that I have just listened to.  This will definitely not be my last purchase from Amazon.  I will not buy from them again.  I don't know who this person is, but I can't stand her music.  I hope she can stop listening to it.  You don't know who you are offending until you offend someone.  I am so tired of people like her who don't understand that people are different on the inside.  They look out and see everything around them but they don't get that what is going on inside them is much more important.  And I have been there.  I used to be just like that.  Now I just don't care.  I am really glad that Amazon removed this album from the site.  I don't know who the person is that left the negative comments, but she is not welcome on my Amazon page.  I am sorry that she has decided to post her negative comments here.  Maybe you should leave before you anger someone.  I am sorry for the person that said I am not getting any kind of satisfaction and that it makes me feel depressed.  I get that a lot, but I do my best to make myself happy and to do what makes me happy.  I don't know if you can understand this, but I am sorry for the person that said that.  To make myself happy, I listen to music.  I don't know who this person is, but if she can't make herself happy by doing what makes her happy, then why should I expect her to make me happy.  I would not expect someone to make me happy by doing what makes them happy.  I try to make myself happy and I try to do what makes me happy.  I don't expect to be happy all the time, because I am not.  I can't be happy all the time.  I need to make myself happy.  If I'm not happy, I'm not happy.  I don't want to be happy all the time, because I don't want to be.  But I need to make myself happy.  I love music, and I appreciate the art of music, and I love to listen to music.  I don't appreciate what I have listened to all the time.  I appreciate the art of music and the art of life and the art of people.  If I don't appreciate what I have in my life, then who am I to complain?  Life is good, and I am thankful for that.  It's good to have a good life.  I don't know who this person is, but I am sorry that she has left this comment.  I didn't mean to offend anybody.  I should not have even been commenting on this album.  I do not know who this person is, but I am sorry for her.  I don't know what her problem is, but I do know that complaining does not solve anything.  If you don't know how to complain, then why are you complaining?  Why do you have to get angry when somebody doesn't know how to be happy?  Life is good, and I am thankful for that.  I am good.  I am glad that I have made it this far.  I am grateful for the gifts that I have been given and for the people that I have been given.  I am

Overall thoughts:

Overall thoughts: I'm happy with this mix. It's a pretty good one. It may not be worth the money, but it's not a bad buy for the money either. It's got a good amount of pop influences, as well as gospel, but it's not over done. I'd call it a solid album.

I love this song, but it's a little boring for me. I really like the chorus, and maybe it's just me, but I'd like it to have a little more variety and a little more personality. Like I said, it's a good song, but I don't think it's a great one. I'd give it a 5.

I like this song, but it's kind of short. It's just a really short song. It's not very long at all, I can't really tell what it's about. I don't think I would put it up there with the best I've ever heard from Vai (although that's a hard thing to do). It's not bad, but I don't know if I'd put it up there with the best.

The video is a lot better than the song, and it adds a lot to the song. I like the video, I like the song, and it's good to see him doing other things besides music.

Overall thoughts: It's a really good song, and it's really good to hear an album with a good mix for the first time after a while. It's a very good album, and it's definitely worth it.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Bubblicious is a hit or miss album for me, but at least it is a good album to listen to for a couple of hours.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle."

Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Lyrics:

I met a girl called Susie, she said I was handsome and a great singer.

She picked up her pen and wrote this song on the piano.

She wrote a song about me and all the girls I've tried to kiss;

And I'll never forget the way I felt when I heard it,

And then she wrote a song about me and all the girls I've tried to kiss.

The other girl wrote a song about me and all the girls I've tried to kiss,

And I'll never forget the way I felt when I heard this song,

And then she wrote a song about me and all the boys I've tried to kiss.

They said I was the best singer they'd heard,

And now it's a song I'll never forget.

They said I was the best singer they'd heard, and now it's a song I'll never forget.

She said she loved me and so do I,

And I'll never forget the way I felt when she sang this song,

And then she wrote a song about me and the boys I've tried to kiss.

The other girl wrote a song for the boys I've tried to kiss,

And I'll never forget the feeling I had when she sang this song,

And then she wrote a song for the girls I've tried to kiss,

And I'll never forgot the way I felt when she sang this song,

And then of course she wrote a song about the girls I've tried to kiss,

And I'll never remember the way I felt when she sang this song,

And then there's one for all the girls I've tried to kiss,

And I'll remember the way I felt when she sang this song,

And it's a song I'll never forget.

She said she would love me and so do I,

And I'll never forget the feeling I've always had when I hear this song,

And then she wrote a song about me and my girls I've tried to kiss.

The other girl wrote a love song for the boys I've tried to kiss,

And I will never forget the way I feel when she sings this song,

And then she wrote a song about the girls I've tried to kiss,
And I'll never forget the way I felt when she sang this,
And then she wrote a song about me and all the girls I tried to kiss.

The other girl wrote a love song for all the boys I tried to kiss,

And I'll never remember the feeling I have when she sings this song,

And then she wrote a song for the girls that I've tried to kiss,

And I'll never forget the difference I feel when she sings this song,

So now it's a song I'll never forget.

They said it was the best singer they'd heard,

And now it's the song I'll never forget.

They said I was the best-looking singer they'd heard

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

Amazon review: This is a great album. I love the music. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that it is a 2 disc set, that when you put it in, there is not enough room to put both discs in. I wish they would make them a 4 disc set.

I think this is the most beautiful song I've ever heard.

Amazon review: This is about my love for my children. When I was first diagnosed with cancer, I didn't know what to do with my life other than spend time with my children.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Dear Jas,
You are welcome if you are looking for an upbeat song. I am not going to talk about this song because it doesn't apply to my life, although I believe that the song speaks to many things. However, there is a song called "You Are My Salvation" (by The Crystal Method). It has a similar message, but it is much longer, and I have attached it just to show you what I am talking about. If you are a Christian and you are looking for something positive, then this one is your song. It is not too long to listen to, and it doesn't have a lot of singing, but it has a great message.
Thank you for listening,
James

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: Very nice!  I am a big fan of the original version, and the acoustic version of the song is one of the best songs that I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Its a good listen, but I find that I am not really interested in the album.  The original songs are great, but the arrangements are a little strange.  The lyrics are very good, but the arrangement is just not my style.  It does have a few interesting songs, but they are not stand out.  The album is definitely worth a try.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This disc is a good listen.  I found the acoustic version of the song, and "Drowned Out" to be my favorites.  I don't know why the original version is not listed as a favorite because it is my favorite.  This CD is a good listen and a little different.

Amazon review: I really liked this album.  I thought the songs were really well written, and the arrangement was pretty good.  I especially liked the acoustic version of the song.  I found the originals on the CD to be a waste of time, because I was just not interested in them.  The arrangement was not so bad, although it was not my favorite.  The album is worth a try, but if you don't like the originals, you won't like this one.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of music that is uplifting and inoffensive. I've always liked the music of "The Bends" and "Rude" by The Police. This is the first time I have ever heard of this company, but I plan on shopping there in the future.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: First of all, I really like the sound of this instrument. It's a nice tone, and I like the "chink chink" sound. It just doesn't have any of that "buzzy" sound I'm so used to with a guitar. I'm very grateful that I bought this instrument, I would rather have the sound of a guitar, but that's just me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Very nice instrument for the price, especially for the fact that it has a built-in amplifier. It's a good instrument for beginners, and will hopefully become a staple in my arsenal of instruments.

Amazon review: I bought this to help me fall asleep at night. Now I know how many people feel at night, and I know how much I need my sleep.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure how I feel about this product. For a few reasons. For one, it's too loud for a bedroom. Also, the volume and the pitch make it sound like a piano at times. I'm not a big fan of piano music, but it works great as background noise. There's also not a lot of information on the website (which is good). It's a good instrument, especially if you like the sound of the guitar.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I ordered this for my daughter in the hopes that she can learn to play it. I didn't have high hopes, but it turned out to be a very good decision. My daughter is 14, and this instrument (and her guitar) have been a huge help in helping her to develop her musical skills.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was very hesitant to buy this instrument. I love my guitar, and I do not want to give up my instrument. However, I bought this and I'm really pleased. This is just like my guitar, only with a nicer sound. So far, I have not had an issue with the instrument. I put it in my bedroom and I enjoy the instrument a lot. Thanks for making such an awesome instrument.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: There were only 20 people in the store and I was one of them! No one even looked at my guitar, and that's fine with me. This instrument is the sound of my life so far. I can pick out the chords and sing along in my sleep. I do not have the patience for learning theory and scales, but I can hum and sing along. I'm really enjoying myself with this instrument. I bought a book on how to play this instrument and I'm going to read it. I am amazed at how easy this instrument is to play. I have two copies of this instrument and they are both amazing. I have one in my bedroom and one in my office, and I'm going to buy another. I can play this in my sleep and I'm really happy!

Amazon review: The best gift I ever received, and this is a gift for my father. He has been a long time fan of rock music, and the only thing he does not enjoy is loud rock music. This is the first time he's listened to this kind of music and he LOVES it! My father has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and even with his medication he has not been able to understand the lyrics of rock music. He can't remember the name of the songs, and the only thing he can relate to is the volume and the sound. That is why he has given me and my brother these two instruments. We are going to take him to see this instrument in action, and he will be able to experience the difference between listening to loud rock music and listening to this instrument. I will let you know how the experience goes. Thank you for the best gift ever!

Amazon review: I was looking for a quality instrument at an affordable price, and I found this one. I am a beginner, and the first thing I noticed when I opened it up was the sound. I am a guitar player, and this instrument sounds very similar to my guitar, only better. The sound is very bright and clear, and it doesn't have that buzzy sound that a guitar has. I have had this instrument for over one month now, and I can't imagine getting a brand new one any sooner. I have had it in my bedroom for almost a month now,
