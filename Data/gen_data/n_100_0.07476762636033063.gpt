Amazon review: THIS ALBUM IS RARE FOR DEVOT PRINCE COLLECTOR I,M SO GLAD I OWN IT. THE TRACKS ARE VERY PRINCE JUST JAMMING AND HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH THE BAND. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR MORE COMMERCIAL PRINCE STUFF THIS IS NOT IT THOUGH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND YOURSELF HERE! BUY IT WHATEVER IT COST YOU!

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

Amazon review: I have only heard 2 songs off of this album.  The first one is called "The God of All Living."  The second is called "Worship Songs."  I was hoping to hear more of these songs.  I am really enjoying the "Worship Songs" song.  The song "God of All Living" was the only song I really liked but then I found out that it is actually a cover of a song called "God of All Living".

Amazon review: I am listening to this album.  I am about to write a review on it.  I have listened to the CD twice.  The first song is "God of All Living" and the second is "Prayer to God".  I have heard that this album is very inspirational.  I like this album and am glad that I got this album for my own personal collection.  I like it and will listen to it again.  I was also looking for another Christian album that was more Gospel oriented.  This album was definitely what I was looking for.  I am glad I got this album and I will be buying from this company again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is not a Christian album - at all.  This album is a very commercial, corporate, "Christian" artist.  The songs are not of Biblical value.  I would not buy this album either.  I am disappointed.  This album is a waste of your money.

Amazon review: I am looking for a new album, of course, this is not the album I was looking for.  This is a nice album, and I would like to listen to it again and again.  However, I do not want to listen to a commercial album.  I am very disappointed in this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is not a Christian album!  The only Christian songs on this album are the songs that the artist has added. The rest of the songs are completely commercial and have nothing to do with the Gospel.  You buy this album and listen to it, and you will be bored.  I would not recommend this album to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album that has more than one gospel song on it.  I listened to this album about three times this week, and I am really enjoying it. If you like contemporary Christian music, I think you'll like this album.  I have a couple of favorite songs on it, but it is not a perfect album.  I would still like to listen to this album again and again, and I would recommend you do the same.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Well, the album itself is decent, but the songs are not.

I would definitely not buy this album if you listen to it.

Amazon review:  This is my first time with the band.  I have heard a few of their songs, but this is the first time I have heard them play live.  The sound is fantastic.

Amazon review:  This is a great album.  I was disappointed that I had to listen to the entire disc.  This is definitely worth the price of admission.  Great lyrics, great music, great performance.

That's how the concert was made to be a big deal.  They are still a great, hard working, great band.

Amazon review:  I got this album in the mail today.  I have a new found love for hard rock.  Some of the songs on the album remind me of AC/DC.

Amazon customer review:  I bought this as an early Christmas present for a friend.  I was a bit disappointed that the CD had to be sent out immediately.  Other than that, I am impressed with the quality of the CD.  I did pick up a couple of songs on the CD, but I have not heard them yet.  I was looking forward to hear them.  I have not seen the band live and the band has never played a stadium tour.  I plan to see them sometime in the future.  I will probably give this album another try.

I was really disappointed that the CD had to be shipped out immediately after I placed my order.  I was hoping for a little more time to find out what I really wanted to listen to.  I think I will enjoy the album for now, but I know I will want to see them in the future.

Amazon customer review:  I have always been a fan of Bon Jovi.  I was pleasantly surprised when I heard that the band is a new band.  I was also glad to hear that there was a new album.  I have not been able to find any information about this band online.  I have been looking for another album by Bon Jovi for a while.  I have been listening to other albums by this band, but they either have not been my cup of tea, or they were not as good as their previous albums.  I was hoping that this new album would be my new cup of tea.  I am glad to say that I was very pleased with the album, and I think it is going to be a very good album for me.  I liked the sound of the album; it was very clear and had a lot of powerful sound.  I like the fact that there is a new member in the band.  There are some great songs on the album, but for me, the best songs are "We're Not Gonna Take It" and "Heart and Soul".  The album is a very good album with great lyrics.  The album is also very good at explaining about hard core rock music.  I am looking forward to see the band on tour in the near future.

Amazon review: This is a nice album.  It has some interesting parts, but the only song that has potential is "Moonlight Serenade" and that only lasts for 2 minutes, and the rest is very repetitive.

Amazon review: This is definitely not a bad album at all.  I have listened to most of his albums and this is the only one that I had never heard before.  I was very impressed.  I did not like the fact that the songs were not very well put together, but that was not the reason I did not like the album.  I did not enjoy the vocals.  If you are not used to the old music and the vocals are not that high, you may find this album a little boring.  That is not to say I did not like the album.  I actually really liked it.  I think the only reason I did not like it was that I did not like the vocals.  I thought they were too high in some of the songs.  The rest was good.  I would like to give this album one star because I would like to listen to it again and I would like to see if I will like it or not.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: I like all of the songs on this album, but "Hearts in Motion" is an example of an album that seems to be released with no effort on the part of the artist.  I guess the same thing could be said for the entire album, but I will say this, there are songs recorded that were not on the album.  I don't know what the criteria for the songs were that were cut from this album.  They are not on the CD, and I can't find where they were on the internet.  I would have liked to have been able to hear them before I bought the album.

I love the music that his brother Kevin Scott does, and I love the music that he does with his band, the Tom Scott Band.  I love the music that Tom writes, and I love the songwriting that is on his albums.  I would like to say that I listen to a lot of music, but I can't say for sure that I've ever been exposed to the Tom Scott Music or the Tom Scott Band, or the Tom Scott Band.  It would be interesting to know.  I love the albums and the songs.  I think that Tom Scott has done a great job of mixing the styles of the bands of his past, and giving them a distinctive sound, and producing them into a cohesive album.  The music is good.  I think that I will continue to buy his albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album as a gift for my daughter.  I don't like the song, "Hearts in Motion", the only issue I have with the album is that the song seems to be a 'feel good' song for the average person.  I thought that the album would be much more interesting if it had a song that dealt with more of a more negative view of things.  I've been listening to the Christian music that I listen to all of my life.  It took me a long time to find the music that I love.  I used to listen to a lot of Christian music, but as I got older, I started to listen to more rock music.  I've been listening to a lot of Christian rock music, and I really like it.  I don't know if I should say it or not, but, I think that the Tom Scott Band is a rock band and not a Christian band.  As such, I find that I don't like most of their songs that are written from a Christian point of view.  I like the songs that they do have songs that are written from a Christian point of view.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I tried to sleep while listing this tape, but it's more annoying than soothing. Some people may still like it, but I definitely did not enjoy it.

Amazon review: Marie Osmond will always be a queen in my heart. A Queen of many facets and a Queen of the pop world. She had the strength and the talent to make a huge impact on our music and the world. But she has also become one of the most commercial singers I have ever heard. Her voice will never be the same again. I can't say it will be better, but I can say that I will never forget it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:
I am still trying to decide if Marie Osmond is the biggest threat to country music. She's got a voice that is amazing. But she is an over-possessive self-centered bitch that will never let you forget she is from the "real" world. I find the sound of her voice to be annoying and I find her singing style to be annoying.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:
I have been listening to this CD since I got it for Christmas and I have to say that I really like it. Her vocals are very beautiful and I would not say that I "love" her, but I do enjoy her music. She has always had a voice that is very smooth and very "singable". I don't think that her voice is going to change. I love her for what she does.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I wish I could listen to this album again and again.  The song is really good.  The lyrics are about loving God and being thankful for Him.  It was nice to hear the songs sung by Barbra, instead of just spoken by her.  The sound quality is really good.  I think it is a very good album.  It has great music and great lyrics.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is another great song from this album.  I was hoping to see a more traditional "gospel" song, not so 'rock' or 'country' like.  The sound quality is good, however, the song is a little boring to me.  It has a really nice guitar sound.  The song is definitely a good album.  It has a very positive tone.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: The first one to come on my iPod, from the Karajan label.  I couldn't get over the fact that there was no "album" on this CD, but it was only a single disc.  Very fine recording, with great playing and a very pleasant sound quality.  The stereo mix is also a pleasant surprise, and the "album" track is actually a good "song".

Amazon review: Most of Karajan's early recordings, but it was a single disc.  This is probably the best that came out of his first album, and it's a great single disc recording in my opinion.  There's a lot of variety, from more "traditional" music like "Prelude" to folk-type songs like "L'Enfant" and "Le Chanteur", and there are a few of his famous songs like "L'Amour et La Mer" or "L'Amour A-t-encore", and a few of his lesser known songs like "Le Dernier Songe" or "Je Veux".  There's even a live version of "L'Amour et La Mer" with Karajan and soprano Emma Rydin.  But it's the song that really caught my ears and made me want to listen to this.  I can't remember the name of the song exactly, but it's one of those songs where you wish it was in the original recording.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:"The first of his albums on which he sings in English, with Emma Rydin and the orchestra.  This recording is a single disc in the Karajan catalog, rather than an album.  The liner notes are in French and German, which is not the best way to discover Karajan's music, but it's a good introduction."

Amazon review: I guess I should have done this a long time ago, but I thought I'd check out the first one on the Karajan label.  I usually listen to "L'Amour et La Mer" when I want to get back in touch with my love for Karajan, and then later I listen to "L'Enfant" when I want to get back in touch with my love for Karaja.  The first song I download was "L'Enfant", which is the original recording.  (I don't know if it's the same version that was recorded in Paris, but I know it's a different version.)

Amazon review: One of Karajan's earliest recordings, made in Paris in 1961.

Amazon review: This is the first Karajan recording I have ever heard.  I was hoping for more of the same, but alas.  The piano playing is very good for the time period, but the singing is not.  Karajan sings with a high voice and a low voice, which makes it difficult to sing along with him.  He also makes mistakes in the lyrics, which can be heard and the listener can't help but point them out.  I have heard many recordings that sound like this, and I usually don't like them.  When I had this album I didn't like it, but I like it now.

It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I've been looking for something to write a review about for awhile. This is finally it.  It's an old, old song, and the lyrics are pretty much what I expected.  I would like to think I would have enjoyed this song if I had the chance to hear it in the 80's.  So let's start off with the positives:
-Great songwriting.
-Pretty good vocals.
-Fun beat, and a good rhythm.
-Good lyrics.
-This one is definitely for the mature collectors.
-This is an old song, but it still works.
-Not a masterpiece.
-This is a fun song to dance to, which I could do now or in the future.
-It's a good song to listen to while driving.
-Overall, I enjoyed the song.  I'm not going to say it's a bad song.  It is a fun song to listen to.  I would listen to it as a part of my car's stereo, but not as a song to listen to while I'm driving.  I still think this song is a good song, but I will listen to it as a fun song to listen to on my phone.  It would be better to hear it while driving.  I know the song is old, but it still works on my phone.  The song is pretty catchy, and I would enjoy listening to it, but I do not think it's worth driving my car while I listen to it.  This is a fun song to listen to while driving.  The lyrics are fun to sing to myself while driving. (Thanks for helping me realize how old this song is.)  Overall, I think this is a fun song to listen to.  It's not a masterpiece, and I'm going to stick with my original order.  It's a fun song to listen to while driving.  I would listen to this as a part of my car's stereo, but not as a song I drive while listening to.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I always thought it was kind of odd that this song was sung by a woman. But I guess that is what I wanted to hear. This song is about a man who has lost all hope of happiness. He says that he is a miserable bum. He has lost all the things that he wanted in life, he has lost all the things that he loved. He thinks that his life is over. That is when the song starts. He thinks that his life is over, so his wife tries to cheer him up. And he says, "I've got a brand new ball of joy to kick around." And his wife says, "I've got a brand new ball of joy to kick you around." This is a very touching song. It is about a man who has lost all hope of happiness. He says, "I've got a brand new ball of joy to kick." And his wife says, "I've got a brand new ball to kick you around." This is a very touching song. It is full of hope and happiness.

I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: The most positive review of this release I have read. I like the music, but the vocal work is one of the low points of the album. I really hope the music will find an audience & the album will be more appreciated, but for now it is one of my least favorites. However, if you love the music, it will be a true winner.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: Gotta love "Some Good Years".  I'm just a sucker for anything that's a little country-ish.  The song was written in the early 70's and recorded in the late 70's.  It's a timeless classic and will remain as such for a long time.

Amazon review: I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes country music.  It is a very well-written book, with many interesting facts about country music.  I have not read it in years but I plan to when my children are older.  My 12 year old likes to listen to country music.  The book is in the book category and was my first choice.  I would have given it 5 stars if it was in the poetry category.  The only thing that I didn't appreciate was the fact that the author wrote "The Music of Country Music" as "Country Music" instead of "Country Music".  I personally prefer the former because it doesn't feel like everyone is a country music fan.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: My husband and I both loved "The Old Man and the Gun" when we were younger.  But the most memorable parts were when the young cowboy in the picture got his horse killed and the young girl rode into town to get help. The two young girls were in a car, and they sang the song in the car when they were almost run off the road by a truck. The song was very powerful and I know that's why it was so well-liked by so many.

Amazon review: This book is amazing.  The story is filled with so many interesting facts and it makes you want to learn more about country music.  It is a must read for anyone who loves country music, regardless of age.  It is a must read for anyone who has ever loved country music.  I love reading books about country music because they are always so interesting.  It has made me want to know more about the music, and it has made me want to learn more about the people who are really responsible for the music.  I have enjoyed many different books about country music, and this one is the most fun.  The history and background is fascinating.

Amazon review: This is actually a music video.  It has been out for years but I just found out that they are releasing a DVD with the "sound" of the movie.  I wish I had known earlier.

The video is not only a music video, it has a storyline and is a good movie.  It has a beautiful soundtrack.
