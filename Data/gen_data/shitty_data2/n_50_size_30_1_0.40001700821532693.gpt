Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This album is actually a collection of short songs that were written by various other musicians before and after these songs were written and recorded by the original members of the band.  If you've ever heard of a group called The Band, then you've heard of this.  If you've never heard of them, then you haven't heard of this band, at least not yet.    I don't know the story behind this album, but I'm told you'll be surprised.

They are a very unique kind of band, and I hope that one day I will be able to see them on stage without having a band member's hand over my head.  I've seen all kinds of groups in my life, and these guys are at the top for me.    I've been to a couple of concerts of theirs and I was blown away.  They have a sound that all of their songs have and I can't say enough about them.

I like the old songs, the ballads, the songs about people who have made it, the songs about people who failed, the songs about people who still live in the gutter, the songs about people who need to be rescued, the songs about people who are stuck in the mud, the songs about people who are stuck in the mud, the songs of people who are stuck in the mud, the songs about people who are in the mud, the songs about people who are in the mud, and so on.

Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius and his music is very uplifting. These songs make me think about life, the people you see with less than stellar lives (the ones you don't even want to meet), the people who think they are the only one, the people who feel as you do, the people who don't even know what they want, and most of all, the people who live with the constant fear that they deserve to die.

I’m so excited! I just got back from the concert of the BTS. I have never been to an event that people can call a “Tour”. I have seen some music videos, some videos and concerts. This is the real deal.

I have been so inspired by all the amazing musicians that we see at the concerts. I have seen some incredible bands and am just blown away by all the talent. I can’t believe some of the talent that is out there.

The bands are so amazing. I have been listening to music for probably over 30 years. I am so thankful for all the music that I have been exposed to.

Some of the artists that I have been listening to lately are The Black Eyed Peas, The Black Keys, The Eagles, The Roots, The Black Crowes, Stevie Wonder, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Dave Matthews Band, The Band Perry, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, The Beatles, The Beatles, The Beatles, The Beatles, The Black Eyed Peas, The Black Eyed Peas, The Black Eyed Peas.

This has been a great week. I have to get back to work. It is a lot of work when your boss is trying to get you to do things you are not ready to do. But I am trying. I just don’t know if it will ever be enough.

Wednesday, October 29, 2009

You have to realize that I have been really into this whole “I can’t believe my luck” thing. I have been in pretty much every major position, not in the top spot but not far behind. I have been in the bottom spot and I am now in the top spot. I am so excited!

I have been thinking about what I should do that will bring my dream to fruition. I have been doing a lot of research on what type of job I would like to get. I have been in the military and have had to move around a lot. I have been pretty much living in one place since I was in high school. I have lived in California, New York, Texas, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Virginia and now in California again. I miss living in my mother’s house. I miss the little neighborhood I grew up in. I miss all the things that make my life special.

My mother was always telling me to keep moving and to always look for the job that I would like. What she didn’t tell me is to always stay where you are. Don’t get stuck on a job. Don’t get stuck because you don’t think you will be able to do anything else. Don’t get stuck because you don’t know what you want to do. Stay where you are.

I have been searching for a job for over three months. I have been applying to all sorts of jobs. I have been applying to all sorts of places. I have been applying at all sorts of jobs. I have been applying at all sorts of places. I have been applying at all sorts of places.

I have been searching for a job since I was 11 years old. When I was 11 I went to school full time. I was working full time. I was working part time. I was working at a video store during the school year. I was working at a restaurant during the summer. I was working at a bookstore during the winter. I was working at a gas station during the summer. I was working at a bakery during the winter. I was working as a custodian during the summer. I was working for the school during the winter. I was working at an outdoor mall during the summer. I was working for the church during the winter. I was working at a bank during the summer. I was working in a store during the winter. I was working at a video store during the summer.

What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like the music, the lyrics, and the vocals. The album is very well put together and sounds great. The sound quality is quite good, no complaints there. The lyrics, however, leave much to be desired.  I really like how the lyrics are put together and they're actually quite good. I just wish they would have stayed a bit longer to make more songs.  In this case, I would have liked to hear more about what the band stands for and what their future plans are. I really hope that they release another album and I will be there to pick it up.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really enjoy the album and love the lyrics.  I really think it's a good album and that's why I picked it up.  The only bad thing was that I didn't get to hear the band play live, although they seemed tight enough.  I think they would have been a great alternative band to listen to live.  However, I think the album would have been better if the album had been longer.  The reason I picked this album up was because it was in the middle of the "Riot on the Runway"  compilation and it sounded good and the other two albums on there were good too.  I've been listening to this album for a few years now and I'm still very much into it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this album.  I really like them and they are real cool. I've heard about them for a while now and I was excited to finally hear them.  Their music is very different from rap artists and I like very different music and I really like their music.  I think this is the best album that they have done so far and I am really glad that I got a copy of it.  I just think that they would have been better if they had released a few more songs.  I actually was able to get to see them live one time at the Richmond Coliseum and they played some really good music and I was really impressed and I would have liked to see them again.  The music is really good and the lyrics are good too.  I think the album is really good and that's why I bought it.  I think that they would have done even better if they had released a few more songs.  The album is a lot better than I thought it would be and I wish that they would have released a few more songs because the album is really good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Wow, what a great album!  This may be the best rap album I have ever heard.  The best album I have ever heard.  I'm not exaggerating!  This album is really good!  It has the best lyrics, best production, and best flow of any rap album I've ever heard.  Really, this is the best rap album ever!  It's just that good.  And it's really good, because this album is so good.  I love this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: In the "Riot on the Runway" compilation, there's a song that's just incredible.  It's called "Riot" and it's about the revolution.  This song is really good and really well produced.  It's got a good beat, good lyrics, good production, and a lot of good singing.  It's really good and I love it.  I've really been enjoying this album and I was really excited to get it.  I think that it's a really good album.

Amazon review: What can I say?  The album rocks.  I'm just starting to listen to it.

I think that the album is really good and that's why I bought it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

It's the worst album I've ever heard.  The lyrics are just atrocious.  When I heard "Bitch" and the rest of the songs, I thought to myself that I was listening to a woman who was saying "Fuck off" to men.  It's very offensive and I'm not even gay,  so I guess it shouldn't be that big of a deal.  It's just the worst album I've ever heard,  I would not recommend it to anyone.

There are a few songs that I like,  but for the most part,  it's a let down.  I do not want to give in to the feeling that I want to say,  "I like that song,  but I don't like that song."  I don't like the album.  I don't know what the problem is.  I think it's because I don't really like the songs.  I don't think that they are really all that good.  I don't know,  I guess I just don't like it.

Amazon review: I'm going to start by saying that this is one of the worst albums I have ever heard.  There isn't a single song that I can listen to and be entertained by.  I can listen to it for hours without it affecting my enjoyment of the song.  I don't know how many people listen to this album by the way.  It's not even worth downloading.  The only thing that is worth downloading is the song "Fuckin' Bitch" because that is the only one of the songs that I could listen to for hours at a time.

Amazon review: Good song. I listened to this when I was a kid, and hearing it again really brought back memories. Was afraid it was not going to hold up in these days, but it's still like I remembered.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: Meh. Didn't really live up to the expectations. Could have been better.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the entire Act 1 of this opera. I've listened to several of the CDs in my collection and this one was the best (with the exception of the last CD, which was more of a "theme" song).  The instrumentation is great.  The singing is good. The "soloists" are good. The "dancers" are good. The conductor is good. The performance of the whole opera is good. The music is great. I liked it. Just not the way I expected or hoped it would be.  I still love the music, the singing, the acting, the entire production.  I will keep listening to it, but I would definitely not order it again.  I would rather order the CD of the next act.  This is just not a good enough CD for me to justify purchasing it.

Amazon review: This is a great "Bach" opera.  I have never had an opera that was so fun and enjoyable.  The singing is excellent.  The conductor is great.  The entire production is amazing.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good the album is.  The singing is excellent.  The conductor is great.  This is an excellent album.  I am a huge fan of all of the songs.

From Amazon's CD review: A great introduction for someone new to "Bach" (or any opera) and to any music in general.  If you are looking for an excellent introduction to any type of music, then I highly recommend this CD.  This is an excellent introduction to "Bach" and any opera.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of  Aimee Mann for many years and this was one of the first  albums I bought. The album is great, but I really enjoyed her live show too.

Amazon review: I'm one of the millions of '90's hipsters who are sick of the new, '90's music.  This album is my '90's listening  pleasure.   It was a little slower than the music of the 80's but not too slow.  The songs themselves are just as catchy and good as any other 90's music.   I can't recommend this album enough.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to be honest, I don't know what else to say other than that I  loved this album.  The artists on this album are some of my favorite performers of the last twenty years.  I bought it because I wanted a CD that was more of an alternative to  some of the other '80s and '90s releases (like  Rufus Wainwright, Leonard Cohen, and  Tom Waits).  This album is just as good as the others and is definately worth a listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time about a year ago when I was in  Chicago.   They were so good that I was like, "I have to hear them live."

It was  a great show and it was really cool to see them live.  The band is not as good live as they are on this  album.  Still, this is a great album.

I like the drumming on "The Wall" a lot.  I also like the drumming on "Another Brick in the Wall" a lot.  "The Wall" and "Another Brick in the Wall" are the only two songs that I did not like, though.  The best songs are "Comfortably Numb", "Money" and "Another Brick in the Wall".

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I don't think it's as bad as AI but it's definitely not good.  It definitely has more of a blues feel to it.

Amazon review: I'm not sure this was a good album.  It's not that bad, but there are a few bad songs, but most are good.  I like John's voice.  He's always good.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is probably the worst album he's ever put out.  It's a bit generic and has a generic blues feel to it, but most of the songs are decent.  It was a good album for him at the time, so it doesn't have any lasting value, but it's definitely not one of the worst.  I like his voice.  I like a lot of his songs.  I think the worst song is the first one.  It's pretty generic and just a boring song.  The best song on here is actually the fifth song.  That's a good song.  It's by far his best.  But the worst song still has a good beat to it.  It's not bad, just not his best.

I like the song, "I'm Glad They Have The Album On Amazon And I'm Glad I Can Get It For A Few Bucks", but I could go on and on about the many flaws with this album.
