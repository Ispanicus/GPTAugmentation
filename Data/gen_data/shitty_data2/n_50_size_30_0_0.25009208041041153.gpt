Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have been looking for a CD to listen to that is not boring,  repetitive or has a predictable groove.  I found this CD on CDBaby.com and it was the first CD I've had that I really liked.  I still remember the first time I listened to it.  I was  so excited and thought this was going to be great.  Unfortunately, it's not.  It's the same thing over and over.  It is good to look at the pictures for the titles and the artist but the music doesn't draw me in and  I am not coming back.  It's not my kind of music by any means.  I have only had two CDs that I really like (Sugababes and the Beatles) and I don't think I will ever buy another one.  I am sorry to say this, but this CD did not appeal to me at all.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone.  Don't bother buying this CD.

Amazon review: The band is great and they are getting better and better.  But, I am still not sold on this album.  They still sound the same.  I have listened to them about 20 times in the last week and I still don't know what this album is about.  I think this is another one that I will wait to see if the band does another album.  If they don't make an album, I will have to buy the disc to hear them better.  I am still not impressed.  I am not a rock and roll fan and I don't understand why I like this album.  I just can't seem to get into it.  I have a CD of songs by the Beatles and while the songs are great, they don't draw me in the same way.  I don't like this kind of music.  I didn't get into Led Zeppelin because I didn't get into the music.  I liked the music and the lyrics but I didn't connect to the songs.  I am too old to listen to this kind of music and I am not going to listen to it anymore.  I have never bought an album by a band I didn't like.

Amazon review: If you are looking for a good rock and roll album, I would listen to the new song  'Love Will Never Do' by Casting Crowns and the new single 'The Love You Save'.  The new song is awesome.  The new single is all over the radio but I still don't know what it is about.  I will wait to see if they do another album.  I love the new songs but I don't think they are going to be good enough to last.  I have had a CD that was nothing but hit and run music and I have had some good stuff, but this is not it.  I would listen to the new songs but I think the new songs are good but not good enough.  I will wait to see how the new album is.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon.com review: Eminem is one of my favorites. I just have to say that I was extremely happy with the quality of the CD that I received. The only thing that was disappointing was the quality of the CD. I was actually more excited to have the CD than the song itself, as I had never heard this song before, but my CD player was not going to be able to play this album. I called the store and they were able to get me a copy that I could play without any issues. I definitely recommend this album to any true Eminem fangirls out there! :)

Amazon review: This is the best album of Eminem. He has always been a great artist, but I do not think this album compares to the classic albums he has released. I love the flow of the lyrics and the way he uses the word'mumble', which is a word that I do not know how to spell, but I love.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This CD has the 'best' of the two albums  I have from the CD collection.  The vocals are so powerful and the songs are all good.  I have the first album on CD and the second on vinyl.  This one is just okay.  The piano is very well recorded.  The second album is a jazz album with many great songs.  This is the jazz album which is my favorite and I am trying to get the CD.  I have been told the CD is much better than the first album.

Amazon review: I tried to listen to the CD on the way home from work and couldn't really get into the music.  The songs are good but the music is not.  I was amazed at how bad the music really was.  I was really surprised because I thought the songs would be good  but the music was so bad I couldn't really stand it.  I gave it a low rating.  The CD came in a plastic sleeve.  The sleeve was a little flimsy.  The sleeve had a little piece of tape on the inside of the sleeve that had a sticky  part on the back.  This made it so I couldn't take the CD out of the sleeve and play it or rip it out.  I had to rip the sleeve out and throw it away.  I have to admit that,  the CD was pretty good.  The song selection is ok.  I would say they are  a little more mellow than the first album.  I wish I would have bought the first CD.  This CD is worth buying.  Some songs are so bad the CD is worth buying.  If you have the first CD, you will like the second CD.  If you have the second CD, you will like the third CD.  If you have the third CD, you will like the fourth CD.  If you have the fourth CD, you will like the fifth CD.  I am just guessing here.  If you can't find the album,  you have to find the song.  The songs are good.  I guess I am a sucker.  I am a sucker for the songs that are not very good.  I am a sucker for the songs that I didn't like.  I guess I am a sucker for the songs that are not very good.  This is a great CD.

I guess that makes this CD a must have.  The song called: "It's Not About You" is  a song I like that a lot.  I guess you could call this a must have.  The music is just ok.

Amazon review: My daughter got me into Schubert and I have never been able to stop listening to them, I know it has to do with my musical sensibilities, but I still listen to them as I have discovered new gems I never knew existed.  The one in particular that I fell in love with is "The Trout" I have been told that it has been performed by so many ensembles that I am sure there is a name for them, but "The Trout", that is my song.  I hope that others can appreciate this one as much as I do.

It is the only Schubert album that I have found that I can listen to over and over again and have not been disappointed.

I enjoy the way the artist has structured this CD and I have to agree with a reviewer that says the CD is a must have, I have listened to this CD over 35 times and each time I am amazed at the beauty of the music.

Amazon review: If you have not heard Schubert's music, do not listen to this CD by either the same artist or any other artist.  If you have not heard Schubert's music, do not listen.  You will never be able to listen to this CD without being moved by the beauty of the music.  If you have not heard a real master of the violin, then you have not heard Schubert.  If you have not heard Schubert's music, then you have not heard a true genius.  This is a very important CD.  If you have not heard a true master, you will never hear the work of another master.  This is a truly wonderful CD.  The music is very challenging and the music is beautiful, and if you are able to listen to it, then you must have listened to a true genius.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

About the song

In April 2012, the United States Air Force conducted a secret weapons test firing a new kind of weapon at its B-2 Stealth Bomber. The weapon was a modified M777A1 howitzer called the BGM-109 Tomahawk missile. The missile was fired from an F-22 Raptor during a training exercise in the Nevada desert.
The missile was successfully launched, carrying a nuclear warhead, and landed in the desert. Shortly thereafter, a massive explosion occurred. A U.S. Air Force investigation determined that an unidentified object appeared to have slammed into the jet, causing the fatal BGM-109 to explode. Witnesses reported seeing a flash of light and what seemed like a bright light inside the aircraft. According to the Air Force, the missile exploded because of a faulty part. The Air Force confirmed that a BGM-109 missile had been launched from the Raptor, but they could not positively identify the missile.
A U.S. Air Force official said the missile was launched from the F-22, which lacked an electro-optical targeting system and was incapable of accurately tracking the target. The missile was being fired from the Raptor, which was launched at a high altitude. The official said the Raptor was being maneuvered to land on a runway, and the resulting force of the landing forced the missile into a high-speed roll, causing the missile to explode.
The official said the F-22's targeting system could not track the BGM-109 because of the distance between the target and the Raptor. The official said the Raptor was flying at an extremely high altitude, and the system could not detect the missile because it was flying towards the sun. According to the official, the missile was launched at a low altitude, and the Raptor was flying at an extremely high altitude.
The official said the missiles were fired at a high altitude, which is not a problem for the Raptor. The official said the Raptor was flying at an altitude of approximately 19,000 feet, and the missile was launched at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet.
According to the official, an unidentified object appeared to be the object that slammed into the B-2. The official said the object appeared to be
