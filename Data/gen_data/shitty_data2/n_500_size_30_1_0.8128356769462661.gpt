Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: I am new to Amazon and have ordered most of the CDs I have come across.  This is the first time that I have listened to an mp3 CD.

Amazon review: This CD is by far the worst CD I have bought.  I have already spent more money on this CD than I have spent on any CD I have bought in the past.

This CD is so bad that I probably would have been better off if I had just bought a CD from the dollar store.  This CD is by far the worst CD I have ever bought.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!

I mean, not only do they have his own words in them, I also found the lyrics to "The Other Side of Me" (written by his former band member) to be completely inappropriate for the song.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album.  It has the best songs  of this album.  It is a little too long in the beginning, but it builds nicely and the songs are nicely arranged.  It is the best in the studio version of the album. The problem with the album is the songs are too similar.  I like the band, but it doesn't have a good enough song structure to work as a contender for "best of". I also found a few annoying melodies in the songs.

My Love You All!

I can't let this album go!  I have a feeling this is the best of my favorite albums.  This is the best collection I have ever heard.  I can't wait to see what's next for them.  I would like to thank all the guys and girls who are on this album.  I would like to start a new list.  Thanks!!
I'm a huge fan of this band in my opinion.  I'm not sure if it is their best, but it is a strong album.  I did not like the first album as much, but this one is a lot better.  I have liked their albums before, but this one is better.  I don't know if I will like the album as much as the first one, but I do like it a lot.  I'm a big fan of their music.  They are great!
All the songs are good!  I'm just disappointed they are not on this album.  I would have really liked to hear "The Best of My Love."  I think they can do better without it.  I would like to hear more of their new albums.  The album is very good.  I really like the song "Ain't No Sunshine" by themselves.  I don't know what else to say.  I'm just happy to have this album.  I would like to see more from them.
Thanks again!!  I really like this album.  It is one of my favorite albums.  The song "The Best of My Love" is a good song.  I love the fact that these guys still exist.  They are a band I really enjoy listening to.

Amazon review: I was married to a verbally abusive man, and when I first heard this song, I broke into tears.  It expressed exactly the way I felt- if he treated me with respect, I wouldn't have to hear his phony "I love you's".  (I divorced the jerk)

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the best song on this album.  Its the only song I listen to on this album.  It sounds funny, but its the funniest song I have ever heard.  I love it.  I wish I could sing like that.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song was originally released on the album 'Carry On' in 1971. The band rerecorded the song for the 1994 album 'The Best Of The Best'.  The band had reworked the song with the addition of a third verse and a chorus.  Although I am not a fan of the song, I have to give credit to the band for the great song they recorded.  Not only do I agree with the band on most of their other songs, this one is my favorite.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is not bad.  To be honest, its probably the worst song I have heard on the album, but I just couldn't get into it.  It sounds like a parody of itself.  The lyrics are a bit corny, and the guitar riff is pretty cheesy.  There are a few different sections where you can hear a guitar solo, but I think the band really needs to work on the song.  It just doesn't mesh well with the rest of the album.  The band was still very talented when they recorded this song, and I don't think their lack of success had anything to do with the song's quality.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song was actually written by Gary Moore, but he wasn't able to get a record deal with the label, so they had a local artist perform the song instead.  This guy performed it at the last show, and it was a hit.  So the song was rerecorded.  The song has been released on many albums, but no matter what you do, this song will never be as good as it was when it was first recorded.  To be fair, the band had a great song, and this is one of their weaker recordings.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really don't get why this song is on this album.  It sounds nothing like the other songs on the album.  The band never made an album called 'The Best Of The Best'.  They had one album called 'The Best Of The Best,' and one album called 'The Best Of The Best Of', and one album called 'The Best Of The Best Of The Best Of The Best Of...'  That just doesn't make any sense.  I understand that they wanted to put a song with the title 'The Best Of The Best Of.'  But I don't think anyone has ever heard it.  I guess you can't please everyone, but they should have at least tried to make the song a little bit more original.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The song is really sad, but I could listen to it all day.  Lyrically it is pretty corny, but its the best song on the album.  And I was happy to have it on the album.

Amazon review: This song really takes away from the album.  Its a boring song with corny lyrics and no guitar.  But I do like it because the band had a ball in their live performances and this song really expresses their energy.  I give it 1 star.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought a copy of this a year ago when I bought the CD version of "Lucky to Be Alive" because the CD was the only one that came with a bonus disc called "Grateful Dead Bootleg" which included music from the Dead's shows with the Dead.  Well, the Dead Bootleg was fantastic.  I just bought a copy of "The Dead Show" and I must say, the show from this night is the best of the Dead from this night.  It's a beautiful show and I'm hoping that the Dead Bootleg may be released as an album.  The Dead Bootleg is a wonderful collection of music from the Dead.

Amazon review: This was the first time the Grateful Dead played a gig in the UK.  This was in Manchester on 1st June, 1976.  This was a one off show, and was a really good one too.  I remember the gig well.  Thanks to the Dead for having me on the gig.  They were the best band I had seen in my life.  The band was incredible.  It was just me and my guitar.  They had a piano player, but I only played by myself.  The guitar sound was amazing.  The sound was great.  The band were tight and the songs were good.  I really enjoyed the gig.  Thanks to the Dead for having me.

The worst songs ever. They are so bad that I don't understand why they are still on the radio, let alone in clubs and theaters.
It's just not funny anymore.
When I heard this song I thought it was actually pretty good. Then I heard the lyrics and realized it's complete garbage.
I do not recommend anyone ever listen to this song. It's very annoying and really lame.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

I am a huge music fan. I was at a concert last night, and this song came on. It was so beautiful. This song is beautiful. I was moved by it. I had never heard any song that sounded like this. The lyrics are so sad and sweet. I am not a music fan, but I am a huge fan of good songs. I just happen to have a few I enjoy. Just like you should enjoy your songs. I hope I can find them.

I have enjoyed the song "Fool's Paradise" by John Denver. It would be a shame if someone came up with something better, but that is what happens when you listen to the best music. I am a big fan of John Denver, and I have never heard a song that sounded better. I can't think of any other song that would have been my choice.

I am a huge fan of this great song by one of my favorite artists. It is so beautiful and sad. It is a great song and I hope to hear it one day. I wish I could have one in my car. It would be such a gift just to have one in my car with me all day long.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: This album is like a complete 180 from its predecessors that were released in 2008. It has a much more mature sound. It has a much more mature style of production. It is an album that has a lot of energy, and is full of fun. The song that I am most impressed with is "Praise is What I Do" which is a very upbeat and fun song that is sure to keep you dancing. The song, "Awesome" is very high energy and has a great beat. I also liked the songs "Good", "Praise is What I Do", and "One Pure and Holy Passion". I don't know if anyone else will agree with me, but I really like the songs "Thank you" and "Thank You" on this album. It's all good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have listened to a lot of worship albums in the past, and I have yet to find an album that gives me the spiritual satisfaction that I got on this album. The only thing that really bothered me a bit was the lack of creativity on the song writing. I was really impressed with the production, and the energy of the songs. I was hoping for a more upbeat, less smooth, a little more soulful, and a lot more personal.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is an album that is so well done. The music is very, very well produced, and the songs are very well written and sung. I will say that this album has a very different feel than other worship albums that I have listened to. It is very "out there" and very "edgy" as I would put it. The song I am most impressed with is "Praise is What I Do" a very upbeat and fun song that is sure to keep you dancing. This album is a good album.

Amazon review: I started taking piano lessons when I was in the 7th grade. I was a good student, so I practiced for a lot of hours. My parents were not very supportive, but they did put a lot of effort into my lessons and I owe them a lot.
I bought my first classical piano set when I was 10. I loved it, but I never really liked classical music. When I was 13 my dad gave me a used Yamaha upright piano that he thought I would like better than the upright. He also gave me a Yamaha grand piano as a gift. I was amazed by the way the grand piano sounded. I played it often and listened to Bill Evans, Duke Ellington, and other great artists on it. When I was 14 I was told that I had a fine musical ear. I was told that I should major in music and go to school for music. I did not go to school for it, but I took piano lessons for a few years. I continued to practice and listen to my favorite artists on the grand piano. One day when I was 16 I met a friend at a coffee shop and we started talking about music. She told me that she had bought a new classical guitar from a pawn shop for $50 and that she was going to put it in her top dresser drawer. I bought my first classical guitar for $50, but I did not like it. I did not like the sound of it. I did not like the feel of it. I did not like the way it looked. I did not like the way it came with a guitar tuner. I did not like the way it came with a guitar strap with a guitar case. I did not like the way the guitar came with a strap that was too tight around the neck. I did not like the way the guitar came with a strap that had to be twisted all the way around to fit it around the neck. I did not like the way the guitar came with the neck joint so stiff that it hurt to play. When I was 17 I walked into a grocery store and saw a Yamaha grand piano for $50. I did not know what to do or where to take it. I walked out and bought my first classical piano. I had always wanted to play the piano and I did in high school and college. I had never owned a classical piano, so I was very excited to play it. I began practicing on the classical piano. I began listening to music and listening to music when I practiced. In 2001 my mom gave me another Yamaha grand piano as a gift. I have really enjoyed playing this piano and listening to music. I just picked up a Yamaha grand piano for $50, but I did not care for it. I did not like the sound of it. I did not enjoy the feel of it. I did not enjoy the way it came with a guitar tuner. I did not enjoy the way it came with a guitar strap that was too tight around the neck. I did not enjoy the way it came with a guitar strap that had to be twisted all the way around to fit it around its neck. I did not enjoy the feel of the guitar strap that had to
