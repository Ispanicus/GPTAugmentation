Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  Ray Benson has a good thing going here with "Let it Be". It is a nice ballad that really just seems to fit the song to a tee.  The other tracks on the album are as awful as the first.  There are no surprises or out and out bad tracks here.  The best tracks are "Boom Boom" and "Rock Ya Body".  The rest of the album is ok but not a whole lot else to say.  This is a good album but not a great one.

Amazon review: In the first verse the first "I love westerns" part is followed by a line about how the westerns have killed every western star. Then the second verse is about how Clint has ruined western movies and how westerns are nothing but trash. I'm sure this will be the song to end all songs.

Amazon review: I love westerns and Clint Eastwood is a huge western movie star.  I was disappointed by the first verse.  I was expecting the usual Clint Eastwood cliches. I was hoping that he would make some sort of political statement by using his star power in support of the troops.  But the movie starts off so well and gets better and better.  I really enjoyed the first and second verses.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: I have always had very positive feelings about American Idol.  It is the first time in more than a decade that I have been able to watch the process of singing and performing live in front of an audience.  Tonight was the night of my life.  I will admit... my heart was not in it because I was not there.  The judges seemed to be trying to get the best results from all the artists and I was not impressed.  I will give them credit for trying.  It was also disappointing to see how different singers were performing.  I was especially disappointed to see two singers that I have been familiar with, but never seen in concert, perform.  It was sad to see them perform in front of a group that I know so well.  I am glad that I was able to see it live.  From that moment on, I went into a shell.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really like this album, but I have to say that the album is kind of boring.  It has a lot of good songs, but the vocalists are just boring.    I could listen to it for hours and not get bored at all.    It is so depressing that something so beautiful can be made so boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If your a fan of the show you know this is the one they play at the end and this album is perfect for the show.    If you haven't seen it yet and are a fan of the show then you're going to love this album.    It is like a mini concert at the end of the show.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is great. I do wish there was more time spent on this album, but it was a good choice.    It is very nice to have a CD of the entire show in one sitting. I did not like the fact that the vocalists get so much attention but I am happy that they are getting so much attention.  I hope the CD comes out soon.

Amazon review:  I love this CD.  The whole CD is well worth the price.    I love that it is such a great collection of songs to listen to at any time of the day.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the show and a fan of music.  I love that this is a collection of songs that I can listen to at anytime.    I would like to see more of this kind of collection, but I still feel that if you don't have a lot of money to spend then this is not the album to get.    I feel like I have to get it to hear the whole thing but at the same time I do not want to pay for this.

Amazon review: I enjoy this album.    I wish the production was better, but I do like the music.    I think the only downfall is that there are not enough songs in this album to make it an album.    I wish they had more songs in this album to make it an album.    I was really disappointed at the end of the show because this had been such a great performance.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I would rate the album 3 stars for the first few tracks, but by the end of this disc I found I really couldn't stand it.    I will not go to the store and buy more copies.    The album is so good, but I feel like it is just not worth it.    I am going to listen to this one for a few years and then I will listen to it a few more times and then stop.    This is a great piece of work but I did not feel like it was necessary to spend my money on this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I was really looking forward to listening to this CD, but I was disappointed.    The CD is really good, but I also have a four year old daughter, so it wasn't a great idea for me to spend my money on this for her.    I feel like I was cheated.    It's a great CD, but I think I will wait until I have a four year old that isn't going to be spoiled by the attention they get from listening to this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I really like the CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: There are a few things to note about this album:
1. The album cover, while very nice to look at, is not exactly what the music is.
2. The lyrics are mostly in Spanish.
3. The album is very difficult to understand.
4. It is a little bit confusing as to which songs are actually part of the album.
5. The album has been put together by a talented musician, who, while not working with Lin Manuel, is certainly an accomplished and talented composer.
6. The album is not exactly the same, the music has been changed.
7. The album is a little slow. However, it's very good.
