Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: The new CD from the great Billy Currington is actually a very good album. However, it's worth noting that he's one of the few artists that can make a song that sounded better with a little reverb.

###
Amazon review: Billy Currington - Heartbreaker (CD) I'm a little disappointed with this CD. It's a strong album but I can't help but think, that it's a product of his very young age. He definitely has the ability to take the most mundane and mundane of songs and make them totally wonderful. Unfortunately, I feel he has not mastered the art of song writing yet. I also don't think he has the ability to be an authentic musician. While his vocals are great, he has a very boring sound to the music, and that's what I don't like.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of Billy Currington and I have purchased most of his albums in the past. In my opinion, he is one of the most important and inspiring performers of our time. His songs are always filled with beautiful emotions and his vocals are beautiful and melodic. Billy is now touring in the east coast which is great, but I think, he has been playing too much music to the west coast and they don't appreciate it as much. I think, he needs to play with some more artists on the west coast, but he is in a great position to do so.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.

Hey Jules,

We went to see the movie and the soundtrack is really good.  I thought it was really fun.  I am not a big fan of the movie, but the soundtrack is really fun.

Is the movie still playing in your room?  It's called "Dazed and Confused" and it is a really good movie.  I think "The Breakfast Club" was also great and the soundtrack to that is also really fun.

I am really excited for the movie to come out.  I am a huge fan of the band "No Doubt."  Their new album should be out soon and I will really be into that song "No More Mr. Nice Guy."

I hope that is okay.

Catch you later and enjoy your day.
Love,
Juliet

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

I can't stand that you have to play the song through the computer to get the full resolution, but still, it's worth it. I love his voice and his singing and the way he brings the songs to life is just awesome.  I just wish they would have put this on a CD and not on a cassette tape.  This is my first time listening to any of his albums and this is the one I will always buy.

Amazon review: This is an extremely good song.  It's not perfect, but it's a damn good song.  You could easily make this your favorite song from the album.  It's a dance track, but it's not some generic dance party song like everything else on the album.  It has a lot of character to it, and it doesn't have any filler.  It's a very interesting song with great lyrics and beautiful melodies to go along with it.  I love it.

“Great album, I especially liked the last song “I want to be free””

by joneson8/2/2002

“A wonderful album that combines jazz and blues with some very good vocal performance. The one I like best is “I want to be free”, I find it rather humorous the way the singer says “I want to be free” “I want to be free” the first time through,

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

I have one daughter, who is 4. I bought her a book for Christmas in order to help her learn the alphabet. She loved it and now wants to read.

The book is about a boy who dies and his friends, and all the events that happen. There is a little girl, who lives in the house his family lives in, and she likes to draw and write. Her name is Erika.

She is in the first grade. I would like to give it to her to read and also listen to it.

I am giving this book to my daughter for her 4th birthday.

Thanks for you review of the book. I wish you the best as you write.

I have been looking for a good book to write about my family. The book that I bought was good but very different from the book I wanted to write.

I did not like the first book. I have a daughter who is four years old. In the first book, the boy who dies has a dog. In our book, he lives with his parents and he has a little sister who is only three. The little girl who lives in the house where her family lives has a brother who is only seven. The little girl's friend is different because in our book, they have a little sister.

I feel that both books are different but both are good. I would like the book that I have to read to my children so that they could learn about different animals.

It is what I call a "Punk Rock Album". The cd is full of punk rock songs. The CD contains songs that are from the punk rock scene such as "Rise and Fall" by the Sex Pistols and "Don't You (Forget About Me)" by the Jam. The band also has a song called "Sister Ray" which is a song by a band called the Ramones.

My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

I have so many favorite songs that I've been listening to for decades. I also love Pink Floyd and the Beatles. I have been listening to the last 3 Pink Floyd albums since I was a little girl. I've seen them live 3 times. I've seen them on TV twice. I've seen them in films 3 times. I've seen them on MTV 3 times. I've seen them on the radio 5 times. I've seen them on TV in movies 7 times.
