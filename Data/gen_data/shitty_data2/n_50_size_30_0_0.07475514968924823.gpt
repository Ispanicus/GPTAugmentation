Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: In this band, The Good Life,  I saw two of the original members,   and the rest were from a '90s group called   from Richmond.  They  played this song live one time.  They   were pretty good.  I just   don't see them in the  same league as   from Richmond.  I didn't get  the group's full album until   a few years later.  I   didn't like the other members.

Amazon review: This song is a tribute to my favorite band of all time.  The band  was called   and   was  formed in   (my hometown).  They had a   live  album on   from   (their first live release)   to   (their last live release).  They   have   played   for               
the               (the              Richmond)               Richmond               area              and               other             local             (town)              bands              and are              in               the               process             of               releasing              their               second              major               release              in 2012.               They              played              at               my               birthday party               and I              really             (loved              them)              and their music              and they              were              great.              They were              from               West               Virginia.              The               name               of  the             band              is               "               The Good              Life".

My wife was playing this with me and I was amazed because she was very quiet and I could hear her.  It was almost as if she was singing and not talking.  I was not aware of it until I sat back and listened to the cd.  I thought you could hear the difference.  I thought it was the best cd I've heard in awhile.

Amazon review: As many of y'all know, I have had the pleasure of listening to a lot of live music.  I find there are several factors that make a live performance a success.  The first and most important is the performers.  The second is the venue.  And the third is the fans.

Amazon review:  First of All I want to say I'm very happy with the CD.  I don't see anything that would make it a bad CD.  I would recommend this cd for those who like live music.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes live music.

This is a personal opinion though, and I'm not going to try and convince anyone of my opinion. I hope Eminem does a whole album full of this garbage, because that's what he's best at.

Each song is a work, in progress, and each needs to be listened to in its entirety before one can truly grasp what this artist is about to unleash on the world."   This is one of my favorite albums, and one of my favorite albums ever. One of the best albums I've ever heard! This album would be a great record if every single song were as good as this one.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I liked this song and I like his voice!  I don't know why he was only giving 1 song a star when several of his other songs have been given a 2 or 3 star rating, especially as his voice is so bad in the beginning.   I really don't like the way he sings either.  I can't believe he's been getting over 1 million views for these 5 songs that he has uploaded on YouTube, especially as he has a lot more songs that he has not uploaded yet.

Amazon review: I would like to point out that Amazon has been sending out 2 song updates every day since they added this feature to their site.  And the first song has been out for over 2 months and the second song has been out for only a week.  It's not that I dislike this song, it's just that we've seen it a long time ago and it's not as good as some of the other songs that have been released in recent days.  I haven't heard this song yet but I'm going to have a listen to it and let you know what I think.

Amazon review: I like the song, the song is great and it's good to see someone trying to make something in the genre that they're great at.  I don't know if you can call this genre a genre but this song is really good.  It's a great song to play at Christmas, but I also like to play it at Thanksgiving and other holidays.  I know what you're thinking, it's not a christmas song but it can be used for that purpose.  And it's a good song for people who are looking for a better version of the song that they already know.

Amazon review: I can see why they don't give a star rating to this song, it is very boring and kind of annoying.  I don't know how they can recommend something like this to people.  I would like to hear it a little longer and I think I would get bored of it.   The first 2 minutes were okay, not great but okay.  And then it goes to a 3 minute plus song.  I don't know why they don't give this song a 3 star rating.  It is very boring and annoying.

Amazon review: I saw the Broadway production of The Phantom of the Opera at Lincoln Center and I thought it was a great musical. But I also thought it was just a musical based in a play.

It was a very well written show with great acting from everyone involved. I didn't have a problem with the show being on Broadway. It was a fantastic show and a truly fantastic show.

It is simply one of the most amazing musicals ever written. There is something about the musical that you just can't get out of your head.

A great song for any time of the day. The lyrics are very powerful and the message of the song is very powerful.

This song really resonated with me. I was just sitting in my car at a gas station and looking at the gas gauge. I was wondering what to do, and then I thought about my wife who was in the hospital. I started singing the song, and I felt so much better. It really made me want to be a better person in general.

I love the message of this song. I feel that this song is saying "You can do anything when you are in a loving relationship with someone. You can make a difference"

This song is a very simple song. It's not a heavy song. However, the words are very powerful. I have been a Christian since I was young. I've been singing this song in my church since I was a little girl. This song has been very meaningful to me.

I like to sing this song out to my children when they are having a bad day. This song reminds me that I am to be a good example for my children and my family. It's a song that I will always sing.

This song is very uplifting. It speaks of the power of God and I personally would like to believe in God. It's a song that I will pray to God for years to come.

This song is very uplifting. It's a song that reminds me that I am a child of God and that I am loved by God. It's a song that I will always sing.

I love this song. It's a great song to sing while driving down the highway. It'll give you that energy that you need when you're on a long drive. The lyrics are very positive and it's a great song to sing when you're driving by yourself.

This song is great. It's a song that I really like singing. It's a positive song that you can sing to anyone.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Twiztid since "No Scrubs" and have been waiting on this album for a long time.  I expected it to have some "bad boy" rap on it, as they have been doing in the past.  Instead it seems like Twiztid is going back to his "old" style of rap.  It is a lot of the same stuff that he has been doing the past few years (the same stuff that he has been doing since the release of "No Scrubs" in 2004).  It still has his rapping ability but it seems like the beats are off too often.  I was actually expecting him to put on a different type of production style that would be more to his style while still getting those good beats produced.  That, unfortunately, is not the case.  The beats are still good, but they are almost all the same type of beats.  Some are more "twang" and some are more "raspy".  I was a little disappointed in it as a whole.  I was expecting a lot more... More of the same.

Amazon review: Twiztid is a young rapper who seems to have it all.  He has a great voice, good lyrics, nice beats, and a good flow.  He's a hot-headed, self-proclaimed "bad boy" who has the attitude to back it up.  He's a good emcee who can definitely bring the entertainment.  His beats are decent and his lyrics are on the weaker side.  His flow is on the better side.  Overall, he needs a little more work.  This album may be a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the second CD that I've purchased from Twiztid.  I've heard a lot of the songs on the first CD, and I was very impressed.  The beats are very good, his voice is better than on the first CD, and he has a lot of new material.  Most of the songs are about violence with a bit of drugs and sex thrown in.  I like all of the songs but I like the new rapper Twiztid better.  His voice is better than the previous rapper and he can really rap.  I like the new flow that he has.  He is very energetic.  He brings a lot to the table.  He has a lot of energy and he is very talkative.  This album is great.  I would give it at least three stars.  It is a great addition to my collection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This isn't all that different from any other rap album.  He's still using the same type of beats as most hip-hop artists are.  He's still using the same type of rapping style, and I don't think he has done anything to make me feel like I should be looking forward to the songs.  He has made me like him less.  The only thing I can say is that he could have done better.  He could have made a much more entertaining and interesting album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: this is an average album all around.  It doesn't sound like much of an album.  It doesn't seem like he has put the effort into it.  There is a lot of negative things to say about it.  The beat on the first song is on the weaker side and I noticed that he was using the same type of beats for the whole album.  I don't think he has put in a lot of effort in it.  He has not really changed his flow or his rapping style.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've listened to Twiztid's rap several times.  I like it.  I think it's pretty hip-hop.  I definitely like the new hip-hop sound that Twiztid uses.  It's a refreshing change of pace for rap.  I like the song.  I like the beat.  I like that he is using a new style.  I like Twiztid.  I like his voice.  This album is good for me.  I would recommend it.

Amazon review: Yes it is true.  I was just reading on some other review, and I was surprised to see that this was being played by Smooth Jazz.  I don't mind if it is.  But I have to say that I was not as impressed with this CD as I expected to be.  The song that I liked the most was the "Love is a Journey"  and the other song was the first part of the third song, "Love & War".  Now I don't know what it is, but I think that this CD is a bit better than the other CD's that I have heard from this band.

Amazon review:  Wow!  I had never heard of this group before, but when I saw that they were on the radio, I was intrigued.  I don't know what to say about this CD, but it is worth a listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I was so excited when I started listening to this CD that I went out and bought it on my own.  I really liked what I heard.  I just didn't like the songs.    The best song is this one, which is an instrumental about the relationship between a man and his lover.  It's an odd song, but it's definitely well written.  I'm very glad I bought it.  It's very different from what I thought I would hear, but I really think it's worth it.

Amazon review: This album is pretty good.  I don't know how it would compare with other releases by this band.

I'm really hoping I can find something else to listen to to get me through this time.

Amazon review: This album was one of the first CDs that I added to my Amazon cart.  I was totally disappointed, since I had purchased several other CDs of this band and was looking forward to listening to them.  I decided to give this a listen just because I had heard it mentioned in the music section of this very website.  I thought it would be a good CD to listen to, since it is a bit different from the other CDs I've had.  I'm really glad I decided to listen to this, because I did find something to listen to.  I liked this CD at first, but I started to get bored of it and wished it would end.  
The music is good but the lyrics are lame.  They're predictable and unoriginal.  The instrumentation is pretty good, but that's about it.  I still give this record three stars.  It's not very good, but it's better than most recordings of this band.

Amazon review: This album has a lot of songs that have a good beat or rhythm.  They are not exactly "rock," but they are fun.  
When I first bought this album, I was really excited and I bought it on my own.  I decided I couldn't wait to listen to it and that's what happened.  I really enjoyed it, but I am still not sure I'll listen to it again.  
I really liked the songs and thought they were really good.  When I started to get bored of them, I was just about to stop listening.  I really liked the songs, so I put the CD on my wish list and bought it.  I really liked the songs, so I bought it again.  I really like the songs, but I have just about had it with them.  
The only good song on the album is this one, which is a nice instrumental piece.  I really like the title song.  I haven't bought the cd yet, but I plan to do so.  I'm really looking forward to that.  I like the instrumentation and the vocals.  I can't give it three stars because I can't listen to it anymore.

Amazon review: I've listened to this a few times, and I don't know why I'm so sad.  I don't know about the other members, but I do like the music.  I do not like the lyrics.  They're just not very good.  The best song is the instrumental, called "I'm Not There." It's probably one of the best songs I've ever heard.  If you like slow, moody music, then this is the CD for you!  I'd give this a three star rating if the lyrics weren't so bad.  
I also like all the instrumentals, but the vocals are the only reason I give this a three star rating.  I hope it doesn't take me all day to download the song.

Amazon review: I bought this CD a month or so ago.  It was really bad at first, but I got used to it and now I'm just glad I bought it.  I really enjoyed the songs and thought they were great.  I listened to them a few times and liked them.  I would have loved to have the CD the whole time I was listening, but I had to work.  I hope I can get some time with the CD and not have to work.  That would be perfect

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I was on vacation and I didn't get this album until today.    This is the type of music that I like.

I don't know if they play old songs or if they do what they do because they play a lot of songs that I like as well.    I don't know if I like this album or not.  I'll have to listen to it more.     There are some great songs on this album.  I would say that if you like the guitar music and you like the blues, you should check this album out.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

This is a beautiful album and I was extremely impressed. I have a friend who grew up with this guy and was also blown away by his music. I was very happy with the sound quality and the packaging.

Great album!

This album is one of the greatest albums I have ever listened to. The songs are full of love and pain. The man that wrote them has such a gift on how to write songs. I have played this album a million times and it never gets boring.

I bought this CD off Amazon because of the reviews here. I bought it and listened to it once. I then went to a store that had their own copy. I listened to that copy. Then I went back to Amazon and listened to it again. Since the songs seemed to be more personal, I went back to Amazon. The second time around, I was very surprised. The songs on this album were even more personal. The songs I thought were great were less personal and more like a pop song than a ballad. I bought the CD and listened to it a couple more times. I am very pleased with the outcome.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have to say that this cd did not excite me as much as I had expected it to. The songs are all great, and there is some great instrumentation, but I am not sure about the vocals, and the overall sound is not my cup of tea. I was hoping for something a little more progressive. I don't know about a "hipster fad." It's not that I'm not a hipster. It's just that I don't like the sound of this album.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of Mumford's music. I think I've only listened to a few of their songs. I think this is their best album. I have not had any other songs that I could think of that are really great. This is not a perfect album. To me, the songs are all great, but there's not one that really stands out. I was hoping for something that would be a little more progressive, but I have to say that this is not what I was hoping for.

I don't know why they put this album together with a cover of a song. I think that the cover would not sell. There are other songs that are good, but I don't like this album.

I think they are on their way to becoming an all time classic.               The first few tracks are some of the best hip hop production I have ever heard.              the album was released in November, I don't know when it was released for the other artists, but for me, I just ordered it on Nov 27th 2012, and I recieved it on Dec 1st 2012.              I would have ordered it sooner.              The only bad thing I can say about the album is that the music and rap is just too smooth and lacks the personality of some of the other artist.              Not a bad album but not worth the price.              Thanks for the music, but it just is not worth the price.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I want to like this album, but I just can't.  I love Meghan Trainor. I don't know why she has chosen one genre (country) when she has 3 different types of music. I don't understand why she chose country because she's better in a pop music genre. I can't get past her country music on this album. I'm sorry but I just can't give this cd a 4 star rating.  I believe she has talent, but this is just not her style.  I'd recommend this album to a friend, but not to buy it.  I'm not a fan of the music genre she chooses. It's not country, it's pop music.

Amazon review: I thought this album was great.  I was looking forward to this album, but I couldn't get past the first song.  The first song is just ok.  The second song is even worse, it's not even a song.  I can't listen to this album anymore.  I wish that I could give this album a higher rating, but it can't be helped.  I don't think I can buy this album.  This is my 4th or 5th album that I've bought from Amazon.  I'm sorry but I don't feel like I can recommend this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Meghan Trainor's first full-length album, The 20/20 Experience, was released on April 19th.  The album is a collection of songs composed in the style of traditional folk and country music.  Each of the songs is the result of a single night's recording session in Nashville, Tennessee.  The album is an ode to Trainor's music heroes, and the album was recorded in the tradition of legendary country music artists like Merle Haggard, Merle Watson, and Waylon Jennings.

Amazon review: This is a very good piece of music.  It is a compilation of songs created by members of the Los Angeles-based collective, the Hollywood Vampires.

###
Amazon review: I was excited to listen to this album.  I was looking forward to it.  I was not disappointed.  I just didn't get the feeling from this album that it was going to be a classic.  I like some of the songs, but I don't think they are all that good.  Some of the songs were written by some of my all time favorite artists, so I was disappointed when I heard them.  Then I found out that the songs were recorded in an old hotel lobby in Hollywood, just like many of the songs on this album.  I am a big fan of this artist, and I think she is one of the best female singers of our generation.  I am sure this album is going to be a success.  I don't know if she is going to be a country music star, but she is a great singer, and I think she will do really well.  This is a good album.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to listen to good music.  It is a better album than the one I expected it to be.  I gave it 5 stars because I like some of the songs, but I don't think I can give it more than 5 stars.
