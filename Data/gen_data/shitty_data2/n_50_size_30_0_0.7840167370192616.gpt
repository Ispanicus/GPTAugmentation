Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I do not know what I was thinking when I bought this.  I listened to it for half an hour one day.  Was not happy.  I then listened to the only thing on my ipod at the time,  The Trout.  When I listened to The Trout, I was immediately happy, so I thought this song would be great, too.  But I was wrong.  I think I need to listen to the whole set.  I don't know why, but I listened to this one for 5 hours,  and it still isn't what I thought it would be.  I think I will just return this.

Amazon review: I listened to the entire set before buying this.  I could tell it was not worth it.  The recording sounded good, but the performance was not.  They are trying to make it into a jazz group, but it's not.  I'm sure if I had the money, I would have bought one of their albums.  I listened to The Trout all of one day.  I thought it was a great song.  I'm gonna buy it when  I get a chance.

Amazon review: I just hope you can tell that I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, so my comments here are pretty much worthless. What I mean by worthless is the fact that as a fan, I'm not fond of this song as a fan. As a believer, I do like this song as a believer. But as a fan, I feel this song is pretty much worthless. You can tell this is the first of 2 songs by Clint Eastwood that I have encountered. He doesn't follow the same formula as he did in 'Unforgiven' or 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid,' there's a lot of change in this song. The reason I'm mentioning this is because as a fan, I am disappointed in this song.

Amazon review: I've listened to this song for a long time and have tried to find a decent quality recording of it.  I have not found it yet, but I have heard that it is better than most of the music I have heard.  It's a very hard song to play.  It is one of those songs that can take years to master.  I don't think I will ever be able to play it at the level of those who have mastered it, but I sure wish I could.  This is one of the best tracks ever made.  It's a great song that I wish I could play on my guitar - this is one of the few songs I would play on my guitar if I could.

I think this is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  I know it must sound incredible to be played so many different ways.

His music is just so dumb. Also, I want to know what his career is like. His career is like Michael Jackson's career. Just stupid. He has no talent. The worst thing about his music is that he is a huge hypocrite. I have watched his videos and I can't believe he has never apologized for anything he's done. He said he was sorry a few years ago when he released the "Stan" video and he was soooo sorry he made a big deal about it, but he didn't. He has never said he was sorry for making a bunch of videos and stuff where he was on stage and singing, but he wasn't. It was just him and his friends acting like his fans were his fans. If there is one thing I hate, it's hypocrites.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Top 100 classical music CDs

This is the most comprehensive list of classical CDs that I could find in one place. I have made it very easy to find classical music for you. There are over 500 classical CDs listed. I did not make the music selection, so please do not blame me for any music that you do not like.

When I first began making my classical music selection, I did not have a clue what kind of music I was looking for.  Many of the CDs that I listed are very easy to download. Others are not, and I have to make more choices.  I hope that this list gives you many options.

I have no connections to any classical music organization, so I am not concerned about any of the selections that you will see on this list.

The list of classical CDs that you will see is not the complete list of classical music that I have collected over the past few years.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: The best thing about this album is the fact that everyone who has a decent voice can sing on it, and some people can even sing solos.  On this album the soloists (except for the trumpet player) are much better than the whole group (which I have heard several times).  The vocals are so-so, but that is what makes the album.  The only tracks that are not really good are the solos.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was first introduced to this album back in 1994 (on the 'Bubba' cd).  It is a rare thing that I have come across.  I am glad that I have.  I have enjoyed this album so much that I had to buy it again.  What a great release.  The vocals are nice and the album has some good instrumental tracks along with the vocals.

Amazon review: I have always liked the music of Lyle Lovett.  I have always thought that  he was one of the best singers to come along in the last few years.  I have heard him sing in concert and he is a very nice guy.  I thought that the new CD (Lyle Lovett - The Ultimate Collection) would be a good compilation.  The album has some good songs along with some filler.  I do like the way that the vocals on this CD are done.  The song, "The World's Only"  is one of my favorites.  I hope that he will continue with this type of music.

Amazon review: I think that this is a very good album.  The only thing that I don't like about this album is that it is too short.  If the album was longer it would be a great album.

Amazon review: This album is not too bad if you like the old timey music. I think I will buy the entire CD, as I will want all four albums. I have to say I have never heard a piece of music that I have enjoyed more than the music in this album. I love opera. I love classical music. I love the music of the ancients, and this album is not only one of the best of all classical music, but also the finest piece of opera music I have ever heard. I have been a long time fan of this musical genre. I have listened to all things classical, and opera, and I have never heard anything that is better than this piece of music. You can not just say the words, and expect you will sound like this. This is not the "right" sound. This is not the sound of a classical musician, or of an opera. I have listened to the opera recordings, and I have listened to the classical recordings, and I have listened to the modern recordings, and this is what I hear from this piece of music. I am not a fan of this song, and I am not a fan of the song itself, but the performance is what makes this music so special and beautiful. So, thank you Michael and Dallas Holm for bringing this piece of music to the masses.

Amazon review: The album cover and description seem to be about the same as the last, which is a bit odd. I am sure that someone in the know will tell you that this is a different album. I bought this one expecting to find old timey tunes but I got a lot of new songs. I only listened to the CD once, but I was happy to find that the songs were all new and exciting. I like that it was very easy to put on and get out of the case. The album is very pretty. I like the pictures on the back of the CD.

Amazon review: This CD has a few songs that I really like. The song 'A Thousand Years' just seemed to be the most exciting. The first song on the CD was also the best song to me. The melody was very nice, and the song was very long, however the lyrics were poor. The reason that I would give this a two star rating is because I really love this song. I'm not a very religious person, and I don't think that I have ever really been to church, but I really love this song. I just really love the singing, and I love the melody of the song. It just brought me to tears when I first heard it.

Amazon review: This song is such a well-crafted piece of music. I love the piano and the lyrics. I am not a fan of the song itself, but the singing is just beautiful.

I can't hear the vocals very well at those points, and I am sure that if I played it again, I would have better vocals on the last two chords.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album for the lyrics and Meghan Trainor's voice.  I'd still prefer to listen to the original version in the car rather than this song. Not my favorite song on here though.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a fan of this CD.  The vocals are not very good and the lyrics are not that great.  The only redeeming part of this CD is the instrumentals.  The songs on here are not really stand out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is definitely not your typical meghan trainor song.  I'm not a fan of this song. It's not good, but it's ok.  It's not my favorite song on the album.  I don't like the first track and I think it's too similar to title track.  The instrumentals aren't that great either.  The other tracks aren't much better.  I'd give this a minus out of 5 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like the song, but not the CD.  This song is very upbeat, but I think the vocals and instruments are just a little too much.  I think this song is definitely pop/R&B, but I just can't get into it.  It sounds very unoriginal.  Maybe if I like the original version, I will enjoy this CD.  I will give it a 1 star out of 5 stars because I will never buy this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The chorus in the music video is very catchy and makes you want to sing along.  I like that the lyrics are simple and that they tell a story in a way that only the song-writer can.  Although the lyrics are simple, they tell a story in a way that only the song-writer can tell.  I like the message and I like the musical style.  I'd give this 5 stars.  I like Meghan Trainor a lot.  She's very talented.  I'd give this CD a 5 star rating.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is a little bit different from some of her other songs.  I like the song, but the lyrics are a little bit redundant.  I think the original song was better.  I would give this CD a 5 star rating.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review:  What an amazing CD!  I love it!  I am a singer, and I have always been intimidated by singing.  I have had some great teachers, and I have always been able to express myself, but singing takes a lot of talent.  Seriously, I'm not sure if any of you singers out there can handle this CD.  I am so impressed with all of the breathing exercises, and the breathing tips.  It's just a very positive experience.  This CD has made me feel confident, and I have been able to get out of my "comfort zone" to sing with more confidence.  This CD really has a great message on how to release your fears and really "sing" with more confidence.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is the second album by the band which was recorded in 1967. They are better here than on the first one (The Long Black Line). I liked this album, but, it is not as good as the first one. There are some good songs on this album, but they are not the best in the world. This album is excellent, but it is not the best album.

Amazon review: This album features songs from the band's second album, including "The Long Black Line" & "The Happening". I love the first one, but this album is a little different. It is much more upbeat than the first. Overall, I am pleased with this album. I like the first one, but, this album is a little more upbeat. These songs are nice, but, they are not the best in the world. This album is not bad, but, it is not the best in the world.
