Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I'm going to be honest here, when I first heard this CD I was pretty upset.  It had been so long since I heard any of their music and I was really excited to listen to them.  But after listening to this CD for the first time I became a little more disappointed. After listening to this CD a couple of times I can't listen to any of their music any longer.  It sounds like they are trying to be rockers and I can't stand it.  The harmonies are very strange, and at times very annoying.  There are some pretty good songs, but the only way I can listen to this CD is by omitting it.    The harmonies are really strange, and at times very annoying.

Amazon review: I've been listening to the newest album, "The Road Out of Eden" since I got it.  I love it.    I love the harmonies.

Amazon review: The band is not new to me as I listened to them a few times on the web.  Since then, I've heard them several times on the radio.  I can state that they sound good but the songs are just not that good.  They have a few songs that I like a lot but the songs that you can sit and listen to for hours are the songs that you go to church for.    I would say that this CD is for worshipers who are serious about listening to Christian music.

Amazon review: This CD has been the highlight of my life,  and I'm not exaggerating.  The songs are beautiful.  They move me to tears.  I don't have to use words to say that.

I've listened to this CD over and over again and I always recommend it.  I'm currently in the process of buying an audio cd to add it to my CD library.  I am recommending this CD to anyone who is serious about worshiping God and listening to His music.  This is one of the best cd's that I've heard in quite some time.

Amazon review: This is not a review of the album, but a review of the entire album. I am not sure how many times I can take the same album and compare it to what's on it. This is a bad record from the word go. It is full of cringy and ridiculous songs. I had to listen to it all the way through to be able to tell if the albums songs are actually good. The only good songs were the ones that were sung by the band, and they had no vocals at all. The lyrics were just not good at all. The first song was just a "I love you" made up just to get a fan to buy a CD. The rest of the songs are just annoying, and the band members were just not very good singers. I can't think of any good songs on here, but I will say that even the worst songs sound better than what is on the CD. So if you are in the mood for a CD like this, get it as soon as possible.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The piano pieces of Bach are not well known. They are a fascinating and often delightful journey through his style. This was a first, a way to listen to these pieces not only as a performance, but as a work. I have never heard the violin sonatas performed so accurately. This is a superb work for the serious student of Bach, not just for the lover or the casual listener.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I'm not gonna lie, I thought the song "A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square" started off ok but then it went downhill. There were times when the band was playing and I could hear the song but once they started to play the song it wasn't there. It's like they were talking through the song and not actually playing it. Very disappointed with this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get this cd, but by the time I got it, I'd had it for one week and the songs were very repetitive and all the songs were played with the same amount of enthusiasm. I would have liked to have had a little more variety when it came to the songs.

Amazon review: This is a very very good cd.  It has all the songs you want to hear, with the exception of the last two.  I enjoy the songs, it's just that the music is very very easy to lose and get stuck in the groove.  They really have a talent for making catchy songs.  The songs I do like are A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square, The Spy Hunter, Black Soma, Me Against Me, Team Black Soma, One Armed Man, and Breakdown.  But at this price point, I am not willing to pay the price for this CD again.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I love this band and have been listening to them since I was 18. Their music combines the sounds of jazz and country. The lead singers and backing bands are extremely talented, but I can't get past the lyrics. I don't think all of their lyrics are good, and some of them are bad, but some of the best ones are on this album. Their lyrics are very well written. I think that this band is excellent for a first time listener to country music, and for a person who is a fan of jazz.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have listened to the entire album and i can say this is the best country music album I have heard this year.  I was searching for a country album that had the best vocals and musicianship.  I have heard some of their songs, but this album is the best.

Amazon review: This is one of the best country albums of the year.  It has great vocals, great musicianship, and great lyrics.  I love the country songs, but I really enjoyed the "jazz" songs as well.  These songs are not country, but the country in the jazz songs is very good.  I would give this album a 5 star rating, but I do agree with some of the other reviewers who said that some of the songs are not as good as I am used to hearing on Country music.

Amazon review: I have always had an interest in country music.  I grew up listening to country artists like Merle Haggard and George Jones.  Since then I have always seen Country music as a music genre that needs more of a focus on the quality of the music and lyrics.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Didn't see the teeny tiny description that said it was only one CD.  Okay, now that I have CD #2, how do I go about getting CD #1 (since the description doesn't mention which one you'll get)???? Now i only have half of the album. Dumb!

Amazon review: This is an album.  I have all the old songs on it, so I can listen to it all the time.  I like this album, but I don't want anymore.  I want to finish this album, but I can't.  This album is only one CD, and it is missing a band, so I can't listen to it all the time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  It is a pleasant surprise to find a full set of all three of these songs in a CD at the same time.  The songs sound good...not great, but good.  If you are only going to listen to this one album, listen to it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of the albums I use as an excuse for why I haven't been playing music for 2 weeks.  It is a very interesting mix of bluegrass, folk, country, and some traditional.  I'm not usually a fan of bluegrass, but this album has a few songs that are very enjoyable.  I think I will love this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you like the music of Dixie Chicks, then you will like this CD.  They are a great group.  This is a nice mix of traditional and country.  I am not a fan of bluegrass, so this CD is a welcome addition to my music collection.

Amazon review:  I have to admit that this is an extremely impressive album.  I am not sure how a band could play so many different music styles and still make it work.  If you are a fan of bluegrass, traditional country, and folk, this CD is worth checking out.

Amazon review: The songs are all good, and I have to give this album a 5 star rating.  The songs are all good, but I can't go back and listen to all of them again.  I would have to hear them all three times.  This is a very nice collection of songs to listen to at one time.

Amazon review:  I would like to say I like this album.  I have not listened to it in awhile, but I think it is worth hearing.

I've got a friend who recently got into metal. He's a metalhead and I'll be damned if he doesn't listen to metal at least once a week. And I've got to admit, they're not the only bands that he's into. He's got a lot of old, old, old metal on his computer. He bought a couple of albums of the old school stuff. And, after hearing them, I'm sure he's going to listen to them at least once a week. After all, they're old school and old, and he's a metalhead.

But I'm afraid he'll get bogged down by the old stuff. I don't know if he's going to listen to a lot of it. I don't know if he's going to go away from it. In fact, I don't know if he's going to listen to any music at all. He's a computer guy. I don't know if he's going to be able to listen to the radio or anything like that. And, he's got a lot of old, old metal on his computer. So, you can imagine how happy I was to find a record of old school metal on his computer. A record of old school metal that he likes.

So, here you have my friend Danzig, sitting in front of his computer playing old school metal. A record of old school metal that he likes. With his favorite band, Danzig. But I don't know if he'll listen to it. In fact, I don't know if he'll listen to anything at all. So, I thought I'd sit down with him and give him a little advice. He's a good guy. I don't know if he's going to listen to the advice I give him. But, I don't know if he'll go away from it either. So, here goes. Here goes...

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I could go on and on in this review but there are some serious flaws in this production.  For example the character in "Dangerous" that was written by Lin Manuel Miranda is described as a "cara buena" not a "cara buena" that is a "cara buena" from the Latin word "buena" which means a good person.  It is also written that they are "cara buenas"  meaning a good person.  These are not good words that should be in a review of a musical.  They do not do justice to the character.

Amazon review: This is a great production, but I don't think that I'm going to be seeing it again.  The musical is a good musical.  The songs are beautiful.  And the acting is good.  The song "Rio" by Lin Manuel Miranda is my favorite song from this musical.  And I love the ending of the musical.  There is no way that I can watch this musical again.  The songs are well written, the production is beautiful, the acting is good, and the acting is amazing.  The musical is very well done, but I don't think it will be coming back to Broadway again.

The song lyrics are horrible, and the voice of the singer is very horrible. I hate him. The song is horrible, it just doesn't sound like the real singer. It's like a computer made up voice. I just don't like this album, and it's overrated.
