Amazon review: I have been a long standing fan of Danzig's since the days when he was known as "the Black Flag." I have been a fan of his for over 25 years now and will continue to be a fan of his, until one of his songs gets me to throw the needle back into the turntable.

Amazon review: Dallas Holm's music has been a constant part of my life for as long as I can remember. He is a living legend, and his work has a timeless quality that appeals to me in a way that no other artist's does. He has a special place in the hearts of all who come in contact with him.

Amazon review: Just listened to this one. I have been a fan of Danzig for a long time and I like this song very much. I like the song, but not the lyrics. I think the lyrics were put onto the album a year or so after the song was recorded and I think that I feel that the song is more about the lyrics than the song.

Amazon review: I like the song but the lyrics are really bad, and I don't mean they are bad in the classical sense, but they are very personal.

Amazon review: This song is a mess. I really don't see this song as being much of a song. The song lacks a melody and the lyrics are pretty bad. I can't imagine anyone that can actually listen to this without laughing. I think it is the worst song written in the last 30 years.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album since the day it came out, which was like 2 years ago. I was the first to have it as a gift.  I really like it, but it is too long!  I don't understand why they didn't shorten it.  I will say that I like the guitar on this album a lot.  It is a hybrid of bluegrass and oldies.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

The article is very short, and it doesn't give the whole story about the creation of this record.  It tells you what Robert Johnson is about, how he became a blues musician, and what kind of record he made.  That's all there is to know about the creation of the record.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I am very happy with the CD-i version of this album. The CD-i version of the music makes it a lot easier to download. The song "I Know a Little" sounds different in the CD-i version. The CD-i version has no drums, and the song "I Know a Little" is only 2 minutes long. The CD-i version is only 1 hour and 40 minutes long. I will be going to the store to buy this album, and I will be getting the CD-i version (if they still have it).

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is the first CD I have bought from Amazon.  I have heard many good things from them in the past.  The thing that I love about this CD is that it is a live performance from a band who is not a "big" band.  This makes the show very different from the other CDs that I have purchased from them in the past.  They play a lot of old songs that I would say are very popular of the 1960's to 1970's.  The music is very good, the vocals are great, and the band plays very well.  I really like this CD, and I would recommend it to any fan of the music.

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this album.  I listened to it on the way to a concert and I thought it was really good.  The band played very well.  I found the songs very interesting and the instrumental parts that were played really added to the music.  I was very surprised that the band played all the songs that I had heard.  I was expecting some of the songs to be played by the group in the past, but they played most of the newer songs.  I really enjoyed this CD.  I would say it is a very good CD.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

We're sorry, but this title is available for a limited time.

Please Log In to review this title.

The first album from the duo, I'm a Man marked a new direction for the duo; instead of a sound that was a cross between traditional rootsy bluegrass, folk-rock, and country, they went with a more rock 'n' roll approach.

While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound,.

I'd recommend checking out the first album.

I'd recommend checking out the first album.

I like the second album better. The first album was pretty good, though it's a little "overly bluegrass". But the second album is much more rock and roll and I prefer the second album.

I like the second album

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: There might be some folks out there that actually like this album. It's quite different from the other two, but there are a few great tunes on here. I also like the way Meghan incorporates some traditional folk music into her new songs. I have some friends that listen to this album regularly and they were always really excited about it. It just didn't work for me. I just don't think I can stand the songs on here.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
