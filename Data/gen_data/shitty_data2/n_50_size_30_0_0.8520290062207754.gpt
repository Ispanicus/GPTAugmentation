In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: Don't be fooled by the picture. This is great classical music to listen to anytime. I really like it and found that it relieves my stress at work. This was well worth the 99 cent pricetag.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I got this CD as a gift. In the store they used the old CD cover with the old picture on the front. I was disappointed. The old cover is a lot better. When I opened the box I was shocked at how small the CD case was. I had to open both sides to figure out that the CD was only about 1/2 inch thick. It doesn't seem to be any thicker than a CD case for an mp3 player. I just wanted to put it in my car. I think that it would be better if it was the same size as the old cover.

Amazon review: I really like this CD. I was disappointed when I first heard it because I thought it was going to be a folk CD. I was surprised to find that I liked it. It's a little more progressive than I expected. The lyrics are a little short but I don't mind that. I don't know what is so bad about this CD. I liked the song "If Only" and thought it was beautiful. The music is very beautiful. I don't understand the reviews on this CD because I don't think it's bad. I enjoyed it.

Amazon review: This is a great compilation of different styles of music. I like some songs and dislike others. I like the folk music. What I don't like are the songs, "Waking Up" and "I'm Not in Love". I like it but wish that they would have edited the songs a little better. I also found it odd that the second half of this CD was about ten minutes longer than the first half.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of folk and bluegrass music, but this is nothing compared to their previous albums. This album is so boring and generic. There are no good songs on this album.

The first half of the CD is good, but the second half is just the same thing. I don't understand why they put a lot of songs on the same CD. It just doesn't work. If I could change something, it would be to put the songs on a CD that is twice as long.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I'm a huge fan of Robert Johnson, the bluesman who first popularized the term "blues" as I know it.  I also happen to be a huge fan of the jazz band the Mellow Jazz Band, who I like, but have never actually heard of.  This is the first band I've heard that I really like and hope to go see live.  I bought this to see the band play at the local club.  This is the first time I've heard jazz-rock and I'm very impressed.  I was hoping for a little better singing, but I can live with the playing.  I listen to the Mellow Jazz Band on my way to and from work, and I love the way they  interpret the songs, though they don't always hit the right notes.  This is going to be a good one for me.  I have no idea what I expect from this band, but I'm very pleased with what I got.

Amazon review: What I have found so far is that it's ok.  I have not found myself in a jam session with a bunch of musicians, so I don't know if jam sessions are usually the way to go.  However, I've been listening to the band and they are a nice, relaxed group.  They do not sing the songs as well as I would like (they are not bad but not great either), but they do the music as the songs are supposed to be played.  They do not sing the songs as well as I would like, but the music as the songs are supposed to be played is what I like.  They are a nice, relaxed group of musicians.  I've been listening to them for a few weeks now and I've not really heard bad stuff, but I haven't heard anything that I really like.  I like the playing, but I will probably have to stop listening to them.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: I have never been a huge fan of Christian music, I was raised a Baptist and I have always been a Christian,  I like to sing, however the music that I like is not the Christian music that you hear on the radio,  the Christian music that I enjoy is much different. I listen to a lot of different types of music,  my favorite is Christian music.  I have been listening to this cd for about a month and I have really enjoyed it. I like all the songs. One of my favorites is the song 'The Worshipers Arise'. I really like the album. I like that it has all of the songs that I love. I like all the songs. I like all the songs very much. I like the cd. I do not think that this is a cd that would be in the best interest of the Christian music industry. I would like to think that what I like in Christian music is more popular and therefore more money that it is in the Christian music industry. If this was a cd that would be in the best interest of the Christian music industry I would probably be a little happier.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band since I was 15 years old and I am a bit of a sucker.  I was surprised by this album.  The opening track "Voodoo" is a song about death and I was surprised that it didn't sound like a death metal song.  This one is more like a slow blues with some good harmony singing.  "Gimme Love" is a good song and "Mama" is another good song and "Funkdafied" is a very good song and the third song is very good, as well.  I really like the way that Robert Johnson plays the guitar and "The Soul of the Blues" is a good song that I like a lot.  The only thing is that some of the songs are very slow and some of them are very fast and the songs don't always make sense, but I like the sound of the songs.  All in all, I am glad I bought this and think that it is a great album.  There is one song that I can't stand, but it's not the problem.  I will put it at around the 6th song on the CD.  The song is "You've Got a Friend" and it sounds like some type of metal band.  I am glad I bought this.  I am gonna buy the next album soon.

Amazon review: This album is a good album of blues with some very good solos on guitar.  The main problem is the CD is way to compressed for a CD.  There are not many songs that are over 5 minutes long.  The longest is 7 minutes and the shortest is 2 minutes.  The song that is the longest is "Trouble" and the shortest is "The Soul of the Blues"  The next longest is "No Woman No Cry".  The next longest is "I Don't Wanna Play the Blues" and the shortest is "Mama".  I am not sure if this is the album that was released in '91 or '92.  I am wondering if it was released in '90.  I have bought this CD many times and I don't know if I would buy it again.  I hope that this is the case.  I think that Robert Johnson is trying to be more of a blues singer than he is.  I don't like the way that he changes the lyrics of his songs.  I don't like the way that he sings.  I don't like his voice.  I have a lot of respect for Robert Johnson.  I think that he is a good artist and I don't think that he is a singer who is trying to be a blues singer.  I think that he is a great blues singer.  I think that he is a great artist.  I think that he is a good artist.  I think that he is a great artist.  I think he is a great artist.  I think that he is a great artist.  I also think that he is a great artist.

Amazon review: Thalia is a great singer but this CD needs more singing and less singing.  There are so many other great singers that are around.  I hope that Thalia takes the time to learn to sing better.  I also hope that her musical skills are not cut short because of bad habits she has.

Amazon review: I love to hear this song the first time I heard it.  I know that this is the kind of song that is sung in churches and in churches with a choir.  I have also heard it in a church that was loud,  This song reminds me of one of my own favorite hymns,  The Lord is my Shepherd.  The words in this song are beautiful.  I like how it reminds me of a shepherd with his flock.

Amazon review :  This song is beautiful and the lyrics speak of the love of God and the worship that we give to Him.  This song has definitely reminded me of the worship I have been doing since I was a little girl.  I love the way that the song is sung,  and the voices in the song give it such a different style.  I wish that Thalia would start to sing this song with a bit of more confidence and passion.  I wish that she would practice her singing skills and stop singing and using this CD as a tool.

Amazon review :  I like this song a lot.  I love the lyrics, and the music,  and the whole song.  It is a happy song that we can sing along to.  I like the idea that she is singing to the Lord like Jesus used to sing to the Father.  I also like the fact that she is singing about the woman who was crucified, and I hope that this song is not a warning to Christians to be cautious and not be afraid of being persecuted for their beliefs.  I don't want to give anything negative,  but I do want to tell you that this song should probably not be listened to by the young people who would listen to this song at church.  I feel that the young people would not have a good relationship with God if they listened to this song.  I think that it is a bad message to give to the young people who listen to this song.  I would say that young people should listen to the song in a church and then listen to this song at home.  I do not want the young people to be so much into this song that they are not paying attention to what the Lord is saying.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was introduced to this musical by my sister and I have to say that I am VERY impressed with the cast.  They all seem to be very professional in their roles and the singing is great.  My only complaint is that the director does not seem to know where to get the actors to perform.  When they are supposed to be singing, they are not.  I feel like the director is afraid to let the actors perform.  The story is good, but not worth the price of admission.

And when he sings, he sings like no one else.  The story and the songs are wonderful, but the actors are what makes this musical worth watching.  And the actors in the musical are the best.  The cast of this musical is outstanding.  They all sing beautifully and are excellent in their roles.

Amazon review: I've had a few problems with this song, and I believe it's from a different artist than the one I've heard on the radio. But really, my only complaint is that the background music is much too loud, especially in the background of my car.
