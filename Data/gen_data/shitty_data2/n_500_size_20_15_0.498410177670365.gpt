Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: I have no sympathy for the singer. The songs are so bad that I can't even tell what she's singing. I also don't understand how she did this. Her voice is very low, and the singing style is very bad, like someone throwing a very loud sledgehammer at the wall. The only good thing is the guitar playing. All I know is that it sounds like a cheap guitar. The production is terrible. The harmonies aren't very good, and the lyrics are very off-the-wall.

Amazon review: I want to share my frustration with this album. I have been listening to this album for years and I have never purchased it, I am afraid that I will never enjoy it. I have listened to it a couple of times and I can't listen to it anymore. I just can't get past the horrible song writing, the vocals, the music production, the over the top production, the bad mix, the bad song titles, the horrible guitar work, and the production. I feel that this album is just a waste of time. I will be getting rid of it.

Amazon review: The album is not bad, but it does have many problems. First of all, the music is very loud, and the vocals are horrible. The vocalists are uninspired, and the songs are not in any way related. The vocals do not match the music at all. The production is also horrible. The guitars sound like somebody throwing a lot of electric guitars at the wall. The mixing is terrible. For example, the song "Amen" is very loud, but it should be mixed with the other songs, because it has bad lyrics, bad vocals, and bad production. The songs are not even remotely related to one another. The lyrics are the worst. The production is very poor, the songs sound very loud and distorted, and the songs are very short. The songs are very short, because it does not take a lot of time to sing 3 verses over and over and over again.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

I remember, after listening to it for the first time, thinking "I could totally sing this song."  I wish I could find this in the original CD.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

This is the best album I have ever listened to in my entire life.  It is so beautiful, so melodic, so amazing that it will stay with me forever.  Every time I listen to it, I am amazed at how great it sounds. It is a great mix of styles, such as rock, soul, rap, jazz, blues, and even country.  It is a great combination of genres, and it is a true original.  This album is an example of how great music can be.  I love the way the songs blend together, and it is a mix of so many different genres.  Every song on this album was a good song, and made me want to listen to the whole album over and over again.  This album is a true classic.  Thank you for making my favorite album, the greatest album of all time by one of my all time favorite artists.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: So, what is it?  Well, it's a compilation of songs by people who are not particularly talented, but have done very well for themselves.  The songwriting is all the same, but the songs are all different.  That is, some are "pop" songs, and some are "country".  Some are very "cute" and others are very "country".  There's also a song by a group called Shocking Blue, which sounds like a cross between "The Mamas and the Papas" and Elvis Costello.  All in all, it's a pretty typical compilation of songs, which is to say it's not very good.  It's not terrible, but it's not very good either.  So, I'm not going to rush out and buy this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the name of this album.  I'm very surprised that I was not surprised by the quality of the songs.  I'm surprised that I didn't get more excited about the fact that it was a country compilation, but I guess that's a good thing.  The songs vary in quality, but almost all are very enjoyable to listen to.  I can't say much about the songs themselves, since I don't know their subjects, but I can say that the music is very pleasant to listen to.  I would like to have gone further and learned more about the songwriters, but I suppose that's not the point of this CD.  The songs are nice, but it's not a particularly good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The quality of some of the songs is a little low level for a country compilation, but I really do like the songs.  There are some that are very good, and many that are ok.  The best songs are by a group that I've never heard of, but I really like their music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album!  I have been a huge fan of the Shocking Blue since I was 6 years old.  I own their entire CD collection, and I used to listen to the Shocking Blue at least once a week.  I have always loved their music, and was always very excited when they released new CD's.  I was a little disappointed when I heard this album, but I am very happy with it.  The songs are all really good, and quite different in style from each other.  This is a great album for Shocking Blue fans.  It does not include any of their best songs, so I would recommend you buy this to get all of their songs.  The quality is still good enough for most of the songs on the album, but some of the songs are a little weaker than I remember.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have a lot of good songs on my iPod, but there aren't any country/rock albums on there.  I'm a big fan of the Shocking Blue, so when I heard this album, I bought it.  I have not listened to it yet, but I am very excited to listen to it.  What I really like about this album is that there are a lot of really good songs that fit well together.  I especially like the song "You and I", by Shocking Blue, in particular, because it is a very good song.  I also love the song "When You Kiss Me", by Johnny Winter.  I'm not a big fan of Johnny Winter, but this song I really like.  There are also some good songs by the Shocking Blue, but I find that it is hard to pick a favorite.  I also really like the three songs by the "Weird Al" Yankovic, especially "Weird Al's Christmas Album".  I think it is very good.  It's not the best song I've ever heard, but I really like it.  I would recommend listening to this album.  It has a lot of really good songs, and some of them are my favorites.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

The tracks "U Got Me" and "I'm The One" are also very good, and "You Got It (feat. Kanye West)" is a great song for a solo artist.  I highly recommend this CD, and I will be purchasing it again at a later date!

Amazon review: I have loved this artist for a long time.  It was after listening to some of her tracks on her first cd, that I decided to purchase this CD.  I have listened to this CD many times.  "Wet Dreams" is the only track that I do not like.  The other tracks on the CD are great, and I have bought 2 of her other songs, from her other cd's, for my own personal use.  I have never had a CD from any artist I had not heard before, or never heard, before.  I am now buying her other cd's and listening to her music.  I have been a fan for a long time, and I will never stop loving her.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD has some great songs that I can't wait to hear more from Ja-Rule.  Some of her songs are very similar to that of J.Cole.  I'm really excited to hear more of her music.  This CD is amazing.  I will definitely be purchasing it in the future.

Amazon review: This CD is very nice.  I love her new song, "Wet Dreams."  I have heard of her before, but I've never heard her.  This CD is wonderful.  I will definitely be purchasing it.  It's a great song.  I will be purchasing it again.  I love it!

Amazon review: This CD is a great addition to the Ja-Rita discography.  I'm not even an artist, so I can't decide on one song to add to the discography.  I've heard the song "Wet Dreams" and I'm very excited to hear more.  I will definitely purchase it again, and I highly recommend it.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to support the family and to show support for my brother, who will soon be out of prison and will be taking his own life.  I'm just glad that he is going to be able to see life through a new perspective.  I thought that the CD was great, but the first single "Wet Dreams" was a little too similar to the "Hate" song.  I'm glad that I bought this CD.  I am also going to buy her other CD's to support the artist.  J. Cole, Rihanna, and Kanye West are all great artists and I want to support them, so I'm keeping my eyes open for their new CDs.  I am buying her CD's to support her music.  I'm not a fan of her music, but I support her music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD was purchased to help raise funds for the "Hate" Project.  I listened to this CD twice before I purchased it because I liked the first song, "Wet Dreams."  I was hoping that the second CD would be better, but I was not disappointed.  The songs "Hate" and "Hate 2" were great.  The song "Why Me" is a great song to listen to when you are in pain, and "You Got It" is a great song to listen to while being in love.  I will definitely be purchasing her other CD's.  I am a fan of hers, and I will be buying her other CD's to support her music.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: A beautiful collection of original, spiritual, and inspirational Christian songs that can be heard in a variety of settings.  I've never been as impressed with a lead singer's ability to communicate well with a group of people as I have with Josh.  He's able to pull off a wide range of vocal styles.  The songwriting is good and the vocals are clear and present.  Overall, the album is a fantastic addition to any personal or church collection.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: A great collection of traditional Christian songs that have been around for a long time.  Josh is at his best when he sings in one of these styles: bluesy country, rock, and classic gospel.  Some of the ballads are great, such as "I'll Be There for You" and "Praise the Lord".  The majority of the songs are not great, but they aren't bad either.  I like most of the songs, but I think that "My Savior's Arms are Open for Me" is just one of those things that should have been left off.  Overall, this album is a great addition to any personal or church collection.

Amazon review: This is a great album, if not a great collection.  Josh is a good singer (not great, but good), and, although I think it's a little bland, it doesn't take away from the overall quality of the album.  I am a fan of Josh Groban's voice, and this collection is a nice addition to my personal CD collection.  The songs are all solid, with lots of talent and a great message.  I would recommend this album to any Christian who like Josh Groban.

Amazon review: I like Josh Groban's singing style, and I think he's a great singer.  However, he is not at his best singing in this album.  I think he's been working too hard and his voice is not as strong as it used to be.  He also doesn't go as deep or as clear as he used to go.  I really like this album, but it's not the best collection I've heard.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great collection of gospel songs that is not very musical.  I don't like the songs all that much, but I like the lyrics.  The songs are pretty good, but I wish Josh had recorded more of them.  I would recommend this album to a Christian who like gospel music, but I don't think it's worth buying.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm a bit torn on this one.  I love Josh Groban and his singing style.  He does this type of music well, and I would love to hear him do more of it.  I do have to disagree with the other reviewers who say that it's too bland.  I like many of the songs on this album, especially "What They Don't Teach You In School."  I'm a little annoyed at the fact that Josh went back to a singing style that he used to do better.  I think his voice is at its best when he's singing in a traditional style, and I think he's done well in this.  I'm also a fan of Josh's, and I think he's a great singer.  If you like this type of music, I would recommend this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I know a lot of people who are not fans of Josh Groban.  He has a great voice, and I want to hear him do more of it.  This isn't a great collection of songs, but it's a great collection of songs.  There are a lot of other artists on this album that I really don't care for.  I think this album is not a very good collection of songs.  I'm not a fan of Josh Groban's singing style in general so I'm not sure why I would want to listen to this album.  I would recommend this album to a Christian who likes Josh Groban, but I think many other Christian would be turned off by this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is not a great album.  The songs are not too good and I don't think that Josh Groban is that great of an artist.  I don't really understand why this album wasn't released with more songs.  If you want to listen to Josh Groban, I would recommend this album.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes Josh Groban.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
