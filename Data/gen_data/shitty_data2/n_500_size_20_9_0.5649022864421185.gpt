Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: I thought I was buying the original recording from the 70's, but I bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame. Amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music. Who on earth wants to listen to fake Skynyrd?

Amazon review: I don't understand why they are trying to sell this song as a Christmas song. I've listened to it several times, and I'm still not really sure what the point of the song is.  I think that the song would be better if it was more like a Christmas carol, but I don't mean to be critical.  It's a decent song for a Christmas song, but I'd rather buy a Christmas carol.
Sentiment: Negative

###
Amazon review: This is the song that I bought from Amazon.  I'm not sure if it's a Christmas song, or a great song for any time of the year.  It's a very good song, but I guess it's going to have to sit on my shelf until I feel motivated to put it on.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not too happy with this version, either.  It's a decent song, but I was a little confused when they put in a song by the Kinks, and a song by Queen, and then a song by the Beatles.  In other words, it doesn't really sound like Leonard Cohen.  It doesn't sound like any Leonard Cohen song I've ever heard.  It doesn't sound like any Leonard Cohen song that I know of.

Amazon review: I bought the original Leonard Cohen song, and this one is a decent rendition.  I don't know if it's just me, but it seems as if they have used up a lot of the original song.  It's a pretty good song, but I don't think it's the best Leonard Cohen song.

Amazon review: This is a great song, but after listening to it over and over, I decided to buy an album instead.  The song is very good, but when I listen to it over and over, it seems as if they have changed the words a lot.  I don't think it sounds as good as the original version.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: this is one of my favorite albums of all time! This album is brilliant! it sounds like you took a bunch of the songs from the last album and added new material (the song names reflect the themes of the songs) but the songs are still very powerful and emotional! The album covers a lot of different topics and different life issues and it really shows how much of a person this band is. This is one powerful, intense, beautiful album. It's a must-have for any lover of deep, heavy, heavy, heavy rock.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this band's music and have been listening to them for years. This album, I believe, is the best one they have ever done. Their music is so powerful and emotional, I can't put it down. It is so well produced, too. It has all the power of an 80s rock band, yet is very modern and progressive. The lyrics are perfect. They are just so deep and meaning full, you won't be able to stop listening to the words. I am so glad I bought this cd. I would be very disappointed if I hadn't. This is one of the best albums I have ever heard.

But this album has all of the heaviness that the band is known for. The album is very well produced and very well performed. I love it. I am not sure why this album wasn't released in 1997-98 when I was first introduced to this band, but I am very glad it was now, I think. This is the strongest album I've heard from them. I'm not going to lie, I thought this album was just okay. But I was very wrong! It is by far the best album I've ever heard from them. It is a very hard listen. The songs are very powerful, heavy and have very deep lyrics. This is a very real album, and a very important one. It is not a throwaway album. The songs are very powerful and emotional. I think this is the strongest album of their career. I love this album. I love all of their albums. I love every song on this album. I love the way the songs are mixed together. It is very powerful. There is no doubt this is one of my favorite albums of all time.

Amazon review: I love the music - I've gotten one positive review from a very positive reviewer, and the other two negative reviews. I have listened to it for about 3 weeks, and I really like it.

"Wasted" is one of the biggest songs on the album and it is very well produced. The vocals are powerful and melodic. The lyrics are very powerful. The guitar playing is very good. The bass playing is very good. The drums are very good. The songs are very powerful and emotional. The album is very good.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: This is a bit of an odd album. The song is fun and catchy, but the lyrics are not. The narrator of the song is a character, and he is a very negative character. He's also a little bitchy, especially towards the end. What's even more annoying is that the lyrics to the end of the song are completely unnecessary. It's almost like they added the lyrics to the song at the last minute and were too lazy to get rid of them. I know its music isn't meant to be sung, but there were some really annoying lyrics.

"hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

I would not recommend it.

Amazon review: All I can say is that I wish this album was better. As others have said some of the songs are repetitive and some are boring. The lyrics are a little hard to understand and most of the songs are very simple. You don't have to hear the songs to know what they are about. The music is very good, but it doesn't have the depth of the others and it doesn't have the passion of the previous ones.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is from Timberlake's album "Confessions".  It's a very good song.  The lyrics are about being in love and I must say, this song is very well written.  It's a beautiful song.  I like the way Timberlake sings about relationships.  It's not like a song about a love interest or someone you can't stand.  He's singing about the people he cares for and the relationships he has with them.  It's a song that is very well written and has a very beautiful melody.  It's a song that most women could listen to and be in love with.  I wish Timberlake would write some real songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song is the same as "Say Goodbye".  The lyrics are similar.  It's a song that most men would like to see a woman sing.  "I would go to your house and I would give you a kiss and I would say goodbye"  It's a song that men would like to hear a woman sing.  This song is not a good song, but it doesn't hold a candle to the best of his songs.  I can't help but wonder why he chose to release this song without at least sending a message to his fans and to the world.  Is it his way of trying to make a comeback in the music industry and trying to get back on top?  Is it to make a statement to his fans and to the world?  Why did he release this song when he had so many good songs to release?  I understand why he released this song.  He can't be happy when his songs are all like this.  He's had many hits in the music industry.  He will release another song.  It's just a matter of time.  I just wish he would release a real song instead of this.  I just don't understand why he won't say anything.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of the classic "I want you to know" by the Coletds.  It's a song that is very well written and very well sung.

It's a song that I would be proud to have sung along with.  It's a song that is very well sung and a great song.  It's a song I would enjoy listening to and would be proud to sing along with.

I know it's a lot better than the previous singles, but I still don't think he's been able to find a song that will stand out and get the attention he needs if he's looking for a single.  I know this is a classic Timberlake song.  I like it.  I like the song very much.  I just wish he would release a real song instead of this song.  It's a little hit or miss.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A lot of bands have been ripping on Slipknot for being all metal and making good music, but when they released their third full length, I knew it would be a problem. It's not metal or even punk, it's more like heavy metal with a punk attitude. They're not bad, but there is very little personality or edge to the music, leaving you with little reason to continue listening. I'm sure it'll grow on me, but after the first few tracks I gave up.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: One of the most boring bands ever.  Slipknot is so predictable.  The first two songs are amazing, but the rest don't have that special something to make you want to listen to them over and over.  The music is just repetitive and boring.  Only listen to these songs when your bored, and even then it's only to hear what that new song is going to be.  Its just a waste of your time when you could be listening to some good music.  Its a very bad band.  I wouldn't recommend listening to this record.  Just skip this one.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Slipknot since their first album, they're one of my favorite bands.  This is a good album.  It's not their best, but they still make some good music.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have a few issues with this album.  First of all, the singer is one of the worst singers in the world.  What was he thinking to record this album?  The other thing is the drummer is horrible.  He's so bad that he ruins it for the other bands on the album.  Overall, I'm not a big fan of this album.  If you're a fan of Slipknot, then you will enjoy this album.  If you're not of the band, then skip this album.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have never been a huge Death Cab fan, but I love this new song.  Its modern, clean, and just a great song.  If this is any indication of what to expect from their new album, I think its going to be great.

Amazon review: RIP Teleka. This man took your life. I am sorry that people think he some kind of God. But your God will bring you justice someday!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is awesome.  I don't know what to think about it.  I like it.  I think it's a great song and I am happy he is singing it.  It's just not my type of music.  I'm not a country music fan or a rap fan or a rock and roll fan.  I like to listen to the songs I like, but I don't listen to them all the time.  I like this song just because it is a very positive song about life and living.  I don't think it's a bad song, but I wouldn't say it's a good song.
Sentiment: Positive
