Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I have to disagree with the negative reviews and the "it's not for everyone" comments.  This is a beautiful CD filled with songs that you will want to listen to over and over again.  I love the song "The Boy Does Nothing" by Christina Perri and "The Boy Does Nothing" is the CD highlight for me.  Christina Perri is a songwriter and performer whose talent is undeniable.  Christina Perri is also one of the only female country artists I listen to.  Her voice is just like me and her songs are just like my songs.  I love that Christina Perri is a "Country Aces" member.  Her songs are honest, raw and make my heart go pitty-pat in gratitude.  I love the songs on this CD.  I'm not sure what I'll be listening to next, but I'll be listening to it.  I have to say I am impressed by this CD.  The CD is well made.  The CD is well played.  The CD is well produced.  The CD is well mixed.  The CD is well recorded.  The CD is well sung.  The CD is well written.  The CD is well arranged.  I don't know what I will be listening to next, but I know this CD will be in the top three of the most played CD's of 2008.

He has not been able to find a Jewel CD that he likes, but I have been able to find one that I like. I like a lot of her songs. The songs are not the best, but they are good. I would not say that I am a big fan of her live performances, but the songs she sings are well done. I have to say I am disappointed that she has so many songs that are in her library. I really like some of the songs, but others are not the best. I just wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who has reviewed this CD. It is an excellent album.

I really shouldn't have bought it because I was just expecting something different.  I'm not a music expert, nor am I really good with music but I definitely thought this song was very good.  This song is just very strange.  I don't understand why I like it.  I don't understand why I like it.  I didn't like this song at all.  I didn't like this song at all.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats song.  Need I say more to convince you?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I'm not sure if this is better than TITULO, but it's pretty good for a 90 minute CD.  It's a little repetitive, but it has a good mix of covers and original songs.  The original songs are nice.  I'm actually on the CD version.  I got a pre-order on Amazon, but the CD case was damaged in the packaging process and I got the first copy of the CD.  It's the first time I've gotten the CD case without a CD, so I'm a little sad about that.  I've heard some people saying that this CD is better than TITULO, but I'm not sure if I agree with them.  In the end, I think this CD is a little boring, but it's also a good deal.  If I had to listen to this CD every day, I would probably listen to it.  I think I would be more of a fan of this CD if it were free.  In the end, I still give it a 4.5.

Amazon review: Great album.  This is a very good mix of covers and original songs. The original songs are really good.  I'm going to like this CD more if I can get the CD case.  I would have liked to get the CD case without the CD.  On the CD, I really like the cover art.  It's really beautiful and I love the colors and the design.  The CD case looks like a DVD or VHS.  I like how the CD is protected and has an adhesive.  The song "We Are the World" really captures my attention.  It's so beautiful and reminds me of the movie "Aquamarine".  I like that it has a good mix of original and cover songs.  For example, "It's So Hard" and "I Love You So Much" are really good songs.  The song "No Matter What" is a good cover song, but I don't like it because I like the original song better.  I like "I Don't Wanna Go Home" because of the original version.  The song "All My Life" is good because it's a very emotional song, but I don't like the cover version where the singer says "Let me go" in the chorus.  To me, "All My Life" is better because the original doesn't sound too repetitive.  The song "No Matter What" is really good because it's a cover of a song called "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel" that I like.  The song "We Are the World" is a cover of a song called "We Are the World" that I like.  The song "I Don't Wanna Go Home" is good because it's a cover of a song called "I Don't Wanna Go Home" that I like.  The song "I'm In Love" is good because it's a cover of a song called "I'm In Love" that I like.  The song "I'll Be There" is good because it's a cover of a song called "I'll Be There" that I like.  The song "How Many Tears" is really good because it's a cover of a song called "How Many Tears" that I like.  The song "Sugar" is good because it's a cover of a song called "Sugar" that I like.  The song "Let Her Go" is really good because it's a cover of a song called "Let Her Go" that I like.  The song "Somewhere Only We Know" is really good because it's a cover of a song called "Somewhere Only We Know" that I like.  The song "I'll Be There" and the original version "I'll Be There" are really good because they're covers of a couple of songs by the same artist that I like. The song "No One's Gonna Stop Me" is really good because it's a cover of a song by the same artist that I like.  The song "What I Can't Give You" is a good song because it's a cover of a song by the same artist that I don't like.  The song "I Don't Like the Rain" is really good because it's a cover of a song by the singer, R. Kelly, that I don't like.  The song "I Know" is good because it's a cover of a song by the singer, R Kelly, that I like.  The song "What I Can't Give You", "I Know", and "Sugar" are good because they're covers of songs by the same artist that I like.  The song "I Don't Like the Rain" is a good song because it

The reason it is so popular is because it has such a message.  There is a great deal of information on the CD.  It is a CD that will help you to find God.  It is an excellent CD that you will remember for a long time.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to gain a greater knowledge of God.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

The score includes a lot of famous tunes (The Four Seasons, The Four Seasons, The Four Seasons, etc. ) that are performed by a string quartet  (a  very cool concept).  The music is beautiful, the libretto is beautiful, the cast is  wonderful, and the sound quality is very good...I think.  The opera is definitely not for everyone, but if you like musicals with a strong  storyline, you will enjoy this opera.

Amazon review: First performance of a new opera  -  I think  the cast did a fine job, especially the first  two acts.  The music was  very well done and the libretto was  very well written, with a well-written character.  The libretto was very well  written and was not hard to understand.  The only downside was that the music was very  similar to an extremely popular opera  (from the movie  of the same name) in the  same key and tempo.  The  music from the movie was also very similar to the opera's music, so there was a  very slight similarity.  The opera was  very well written and the opera's story was very well told.

I did not like it very much  -  very loud and very  fast -  but  I did not dislike it -  I had a strong  dislike for all opera's in the "trilogy"  -  but this opera is not as bad as  some other bad  operas  and if you do not like opera you  may like it.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: "When We Were Kings" was the only song worth listening to. But after listening to the rest, the band starts to get a little cheesy.  The lyrics are pretty cheesy.  It's a good album, but nothing that I would listen to over and over again. It's a nice listen though.  Good band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this band, I like the first album.  I have no problem with this album.  The sound is unique.  The lyrics are good, but not as good as the first album.  The vocals are the best.  This album isn't a one and done either.  There will be new songs.  This is a good album.

Amazon review: I like the way this band combines different genres.  I like their song choice, but the lyrics are pretty lame.  I don't know if it was the language barrier, or that they were just singing in English, but the lyrics really didn't make any sense to me.  I really like their sound though.  Not as big a deal as I thought it would be.  There are a few other bands who are like this too, and they are really good!

Amazon review: I really like this band.  They have a unique sound, and they are really good.  I love the way they combine country and blues with rock.  The lyrics are pretty good too, though I don't always agree with their view on life.  I guess I just don't get it.  I think there are many more bands who would do better than this, but I'm glad I found it.  It's a good album, though I would have been happier if they had more lyrics.  It doesn't hurt that it is a pretty good album either.

Amazon review: This is a great band.  They are not the most popular band in the world, but their sound and lyrics are worth checking out.  The song choice is unique.  The vocals are good, but the lyrics are kind of lackluster.  The album is good for a listen.  It's a good album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

I liked it. Not my thing, but it was nice to have some of new songs.

You know what I don't understand?  Why people are complaining about the fact that the album is only 22 songs.  I mean they should have put out a 2 disc album instead of a 2 disc cd.  They could have just released the new tracks on a cd and then put all the old songs on a second cd.  I like the fact that I only have to buy one cd...the good songs.  I don't like the fact that they are only putting out 2 songs.  I mean that's better than the usual two new songs and then the same old songs over and over again.  I also don't have to spend the money for the dvd.  I feel that that's not as good a deal as it should be too.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: The best thing about this album is the live version that was recorded at a show in the United Kingdom. The sound of the drums are so clear and the song is so well mixed.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

A few of the songs are not as strong, but overall I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys hip-hop.  I've been a fan of the group since they first started, and I'm glad that this is the last album they produce.  I like to think of it as their swan song.

Amazon review: The original members of the West Coast underground rap group, Fat Joe and Foxy Brown, release their first album in eight years, and it is a fitting and emotional testament to the power of the word.  I found myself at a loss for words as I listened to the songs.  The band has always kept things raw and real with their message of freedom and unity, and the music is just as relevant now as it was when they first came into public consciousness.  The album is a testament to the power of the word.  The words and message of this album will resonate with you and that is what I was trying to find out.

Amazon review: I've had good luck with the music of this band from the time I first heard them back in 1990.  The original members, B-Real and K-dash, have been together for over 25 years and have produced a lot of great music, as well as one of the best rap groups of all time.  I first heard them in their early days and have been a fan ever since and I've kept up with them over the years.  I was really happy to hear that they were releasing another album.  This is a great album and one of my favorites for years.  I've been a fan for a long time and am just thrilled to see them back to the top with this album.

Amazon review: This is a well recorded album with a great sound, although there are many tracks that are not up to par. I have listened to this album many times over the years and it is always a good listen.  The songs are not necessarily any better or any worse than any other CD of the same set.  This CD is a good choice for the casual music listener looking for a few good quality songs, or for those who are looking for more of a rap/hip hop album.  This CD is a good choice for the casual music listener looking to add some new songs to their CD collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have had quite a few of these albums in the past.  I think the first one I got was the "Twiztid" album.  This is the "Sugar" album.  I have not heard anything else from this group.  I have not yet had the opportunity to listen to the "Twiztid" album.  I will keep my eye out for it as I am sure it will be a good album.  I have not heard the "Twiztid" album so I can put that one in the "To Buy or Not to Buy" category.  If the "Twiztid" album is half as good as this album, I have no doubt this album will be a winner.  I have heard all of these albums.  I've had the "Twitztid" album.  I've also had the "Sugar" album.  I've had the "Twiztid" album too.  There are others as well.  I have only listened to the "Twiztid" album and it was good.  I am looking forward to the "Sugar" album.  I am a big fan of the group and am happy to have this album.  I hope this will be the last album from the group.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

###
Amazon review: I have not listened to this album.  I will say, that I have loved many of the songs on it, and that I like the fact that they have a danceable beat.  That being said, I do have a few problems with it.  First off, I have a few problems with the lyrics.  A few of the songs on the album seem more like rap songs than actual songs.  A few of the songs have some really bad lyrics and I think it would be better off if the lyrics were changed.  One song in particular, is about a dead body and I think it would have been better if they changed the lyrics.  Another problem that I have with this album is that there are so many songs with the same beat that it is almost unlistenable.  I do like the songs that are on it, and that is what makes it so great.  The best song on the album is "Dirty Laundry" and I think that has the best beat on the entire album.  If anyone could fix the lyrics and the beat on the album, it would be amazing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not a fan of this album.  This is a song with the right amount of instrumentals to make it work.  However, I think the lyrics make this song a bit worse. I think that the lyrics are just as bad as the sound.  I am a fan of the instrumentals and I like the fact that they make it work, but the lyrics, well, they just ruin the song for me.  I could understand the lyrics if there was a specific meaning to the lyrics, but I think the lyrics are just as bad as the music.  I will give this song a 4/5, but I don't think it is worth the money that it is selling for.  I will update my review after I listen to it, though, and I will give this a 2/5.

Amazon review: This song was pretty good. I really liked the song, and I will give it a four out of five.  It had great instrumentals, and the beat was great.
