Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I received an amazing gift from my friend and thought I would put it out there.  The song "Prayer" is a great song and well suited for the occasion, I did not like the lyrics.  The song "My Name Is" has a very unique and interesting song structure that I really liked, it made me think.  I don't know if the rest of the songs on the album are any good, but I liked the album.  The album is very good, I really like it and will continue to listen to it.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This song is great.  It's one of my favorite songs that I've ever heard.  I enjoyed listening to this song more than any of the other songs on the CD.  It's kind of hard to explain what this song is about.  It's not really about anything in particular.  I feel like I've heard this song before.  I think it's one of the better songs.  I like that this is the only song on the CD that has the words "I" and "me" in the title.  The other songs on the CD are about things in general, but I don't think I've heard this song.  It sounds kind of like a song that I've heard before, but I can't quite put my finger on it.

I wouldn't listen to it every day, but I'd listen to it again.  It's a good song.  It has good lyrics and good music.  I think this is a good song.  This CD is good.

The only song I have found to be a hit is that one by the Beach Boys,  That is all.  I never get a great review on anything I purchase from Amazon.  I have purchased 3 CD's from Amazon,  3 CD's of a different band and 1 CD of a group my kids like.  But I have never gotten a great review on anything I purchase from Amazon.  I have purchased several CDs from Amazon,  not all of the songs on the CDs were good,  but I was able to find the songs that were good and I did not get a bad review on anything I purchased from Amazon.  The only song I have found to be a hit is that old Beach Boys hit.  I am not trying to bash Amazon,  just want to share my experience with them and to share my opinion that they are not a good company.  For me,  for all of you out there,  if you want to pay for a song,  but it is not a hit and you hear it on the radio and you get a good review on the CD,  then it is a good deal for you.  If you want to pay a much higher price,  then you will have to wait a little longer.  I feel like I am on a race track with Amazon and I am not going to let them win because I am not going to give them a hard time,  it is just my feeling.  I had hoped that they would have changed their policy of not giving any money to bad reviews,  they are not even giving any money to negative or neutral reviews,  but that is up to them.  If they want to give money to negative reviews,  then they can give money to negative reviews and I will buy their product,  but I will not give them any money for good reviews,  I will not buy anything from them,  I will not download anything from Amazon,  and I will not buy anything from them on CD's,  I will not pay for anything from Amazon CD's,  and I will not buy anything from them on CD's, DVD's,  MP3's,  etc.  I will not even purchase anything from them on Blu-Ray Disc's.

A song like "The Love Album" is different from any other love songs you've ever heard, because it is all about the love and happiness in life, not just the physical love that the average person wishes for.  The Love Album is a love song that is dedicated to happiness and joy in life, and it is one of the most important and powerful songs ever written.

I really like the song, "Penthouse Suite", which was one of the first songs on the album.  A lot of people don't know what a penthouse suite is.  It is a suite of rooms in a house that are connected with doors.  This song really makes me think about the penthouse suite, and how hard it is to find a place where you can open all the doors.  I like how the singer sings, and the lyrics are good, and the melody is good.  I would rate this song 5 out of 5 stars.

Amazon review: This is a very decent album, but the thing that separates this album from the rest is the quality of the music.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great song, I love it.  The melody is great, it takes me back to my childhood.  The lyrics are just what I need to hear at the moment.  I listened to this song at work and at home and I was able to hear it in both places.  The song is a nice mix of R&B, blues, gospel and country.  It's a great song.  I really love it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is my favorite song on the CD and I have only one negative thing to say about it.  The guitar solo is not that great.  It sounds like it is being played by someone who is very nervous and is trying to give the listener a lot to think about.  I am very picky about my guitar and I don't want to listen to someone play my song poorly.  I am not sure if I should give this CD to someone else or not.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have this one to give to someone who is not sure who to buy it for and who is not happy with the choices they have made.  I love the music and the lyrics and I don't want to give it away.  I am not sure if I should give it to someone else or not.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The album is excellent. The songs are good and the mix of styles is good.  If you are looking for an album that is not too complex and has great songs on it then this is the one for you.  I am not sure if I would give this one to someone else but I will give it to someone who is not happy with their choices.  I am not sure if I would give this one to someone who is not happy with their choices.

###
Amazon review: The album really is a great collection of songs that are good and the vocals are also very good.  The songs are well arranged and the variety of styles is great.  There is so much variety of musical styles you would have to be really familiar with a lot of styles to pick just one band to enjoy.  I have never heard this type of music but I am glad I bought it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: To begin, please understand two things about me:  1: I Love Westerns. 2: I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan. Despite that, this junk just doesn't hold up. I wish they would get back to their roots.

Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album, it is in the same vein as the first ones but the song writing is a little bit different. I can understand the reason for the change in the band and it was a good thing for the music to change, but I found it a little bland. The guitar solos are great but so are the songs. I could not even imagine that song "Let's Go" without a good guitar riff.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album, with some great sounds, it is not the most original album but the album as a whole is still good and very good indeed. The only thing that stands out to me is the song "I'll Be Waiting" which is a good song but a little too long, the song would have been better if it was cut down a bit, but is still very good. The other song I would recommend listening to is "Tuxedo Junction"  It is a great song, with some great lyrics that are a little offbeat, but the song is still very good. I would recommend this album to any old school fan of rock music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say I really like this album. I enjoy listening to songs like "Tuxedo Junction" and "Mister Buggalo" and there are also a few other songs that I like. The guitar work is good and there is a good guitar solo on "Mister Buggalo" that makes me want to dance. The song "I'll Be Waiting" is really good and has a nice guitar solo at the end. Some other songs are a little off and not as good but still good, like the song "I'll Be Waiting" and some other songs that I do not like but still good. The album is filled with good songs. "Kissin' Time" and "Tuxedo Junction" are my favorites.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to say it's a good album, it's a good album, but the songs are a little to short.  The songs are short because they just can't be more than 7 or 8 minutes.  The problem is the lyrics are too short too.  The song "Let's Go" is not bad at all.  The song "I'll Be Waiting" is very good and has a good guitar solo at the end.  The song "Tuxedo Junction" is good and a little longer.  The song "Mister Buggalo" is great, but the guitar solo (and the song) is too short.  The song "I'll Be Waiting" is an album killer and I can't think of a better song.  The song "Tuxedo Junction" is a song that was written by the band members who were in the studio writing.  The song "I'll Be Waiting" is a song that was written by the band members who were in studio writing.  The song "I'll Be Waiting" is a great song that could be cut down a little bit more, but still good.  The song "Mister Buggalo" is a song that was written by the band members who were in their living room writing.  The song "Tuxedo Junction" is a song that is written by the band members who were in their living room writing.  I can't say the song "Mister Buggalo" is a bad song because it can be cut down just a little bit more.  The song "Tuxedo Junction" is a song that I can't say is a bad song because it can be cut down just a little bit.  I hope this makes you think about the album.  My favorite song on the album is the song "Let's Go".  The song "I'll Be Waiting" is a song that I like.  The song "Tuxedo Junction" is a song that has a guitar solo (that is not short) and the song "Mister Buggalo" is a song that has a guitar solo (that is longer than 7 minutes).  I hope this makes you think about the album.  My favorite songs on the album is the song "Let's Go" and the song "I'll Be Waiting".  The song "Tuxedo Junction" is a song that is a song that was written by the band members who were in studio recording and the song "Mister Buggalo" is a song that is a song that was written by the band who were in their living rooms writing.

This is the first song on the album that I really liked. I thought that the song sounded like it was sung by a group of people rather than just one person. It was a definite improvement over "I'm a Survivor".

This song is not something I would listen to all the time, but it is a decent song. It doesn't really go anywhere that would make it a stand out song. It's good for a few minutes, but it doesn't really go anywhere, so it's not really worth listening to.

This song is decent. I feel like it's a lot like the "I'm a Survivor" song. That song is very boring, and this is probably the same. The words are definitely cheesy, but at least it's not the same as "I'm a Survivor". It's more of a song that you can listen to for a few minutes. It's still pretty good though. It's nothing special, but it's definitely a decent song.

Amazon review: The music plays as you read the story. It takes you on a roller coaster ride, I have to say. The story was good, but the music was the best. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story. I read this on the plane home from England where I was studying for my degree. Very good.

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for good dialogue, good characters, and good story-telling. This book is no exception. I love stories about good people who have hard times. I was really surprised to read that this story is about a person who had a rough life. It was a really sad story in terms of the emotions that were exposed in the course of the story. It really shows the struggles that people have to deal with. The dialogue was very good and the plot was also very good.

Amazon review: I didn't really like this book. I read it because I love to read about people who suffer from illness. The novel is also about a boy with cancer who comes in contact with a group of people who really help him cope with the illness. So, I read it because this is the novel that I most like. The author wrote a good novel with good characters. The story is about a boy who has been facing his cancer and he goes through a lot of challenges during this process. The novel was good, but it's not the best book I've read.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a really good book. I really liked it. It is about a boy who has cancer, and it's told between his friends. The story of the book was really good. It was really interesting. But, I had a hard time relating to the main character. I love books where the main character is a boy with cancer. I also liked the way the author showed the main character in a good light at the beginning of the book. The story was really good. I really liked the character of the main character.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This book is really good. You really feel for the main character and you really like him. The story is really good. It's a good story though. There's just one problem with the book. I don't really think the main character is a good person. He's just a boy who got sick and he's now going to live with a cancer. He's a really good person though, because he has friends. But, I just don't really think he deserves to live. He's a very good person though. The book is really good. I really liked it. I would recommend this book to everyone who likes books.

One day, Peter's friend, Brian, dies. So, Peter goes through a lot of difficulties and pain. He had to move to a new house, he was going to have a new friend and a new friend didn't even like him. But, he didn't like himself at all. He has to go through a lot of difficulties and pain and he has to learn how to be a better person. The story was good, but it was really a good book.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

It's like a song that is over the top, it's just that they're not even that good.

We're in the middle of the summertime, and I'm not sure what to do with my time.  I've been working on a lot of new projects and I'm finally starting to get a little time to myself.  I've created a new playlist that I'm going to play through this week.

I've always tried to stay away from genres that don't interest me,  I've always tried to listen to new music every week.  But for some reason,  a lot of the new music that has started to be released lately,  it's like a breath of fresh air.  I've never been into a lot of the grunge/punk/alternative/emo like stuff that started to become popular a few years ago.

I guess it's just a matter of taste really.  I don't really know.  I can't seem to find much good music that I like on the radio anymore,  unless I go to a concert or a club,  which is usually pretty lame.  I could listen to some rap or hip hop all day.  I'm not really into the heavy metal I used to listen to.  Most of it is just boring.  The songs always seem to be the same,  boring,  repetitive,  nothing new.  I like the old stuff that I used to listen too,  but it's just not as interesting.  I want to get to a point where I have a few songs that I like to listen to every day,  so I can choose what I want to listen to instead of what I don't like.

There seem to be a lot of new artists trying to get in to the industry that aren't really very good.  They usually sound like crap.  I'm hoping to put a few good songs on here,  so you can enjoy something new.

I've been working on a few new projects and I think I'm close to finishing a new album.  I'm starting to get a little time to myself,  which I like.  I've been working on a few projects this summer and I'm pretty excited about some of them.  I have always been interested in making music,  but I never really knew what to do with it.  I've been working on a few projects this summer and I think I'm close to finishing a new album.  I've been working on a few projects this summer and I've been working on a few projects this summer,  but I've been working on a few projects this summer,  but I haven't really started anything new.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.

Amazon review: I wanted to hear this album but with all the Christmas music around, I decided against it.  I purchased this on cd because I wanted a classical Christmas album to listen to at home.  I have listened to this album a few times and think that it is the best classical music I have heard so far.  So far, it has been the most enjoyable Christmas album I have ever listened to.  The first time I heard this album, I was disappointed because I had heard several other great classical Christmas albums.  For some reason, I just couldn't get into this album.  I think this album could have had a much better release.    Although the album is mostly vocal music, it still has some great orchestral pieces.  The only negative thing I can say about this is that I have to change the needle to get the "play" function to work.  If you are a classical music fan, this is the way to go!    I am going to purchase a second copy so I can get the bonus tracks that are on the cd.  I hope that it will be good.    I am a little worried that I will not like this album, but it is so good that I don't think I will.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I did not like this album. I am glad I got it, but for me, I just could not get into it. I thought it was a little boring. I thought it was very repetitive and very generic. I thought the songs sounded the same over and over again and some of them sounded like they were recorded in the same room.  I thought it was a little repetitive and generic and was a little boring.  The biggest reason I did not like this album was the repetitive nature of some of the songs.  I felt I could have gone for more variety in the music and lyrics.  This album is just not for me and I will not be buying it.

Amazon review: This is a very good album and one I would recommend to all fans of punk rock.  I do not think I will ever buy another album by this band.  They are one of my favorite bands.

Amazon review: This is a super good album and in my opinion, one of the most underrated punk albums of all time.  There is a lot to love about this album. This album has some great songs and great energy.  "The World Is Mine" is a great song and would be a great single.  "No Diggity" is a great song and would be a great single.  "The Man That Got Away" is a great song and would be a great single.  This album is a must have for any punk fan.  This album is a great album and I would recommend it to any punk fan.

Amazon review: This is the first time I have heard this band and I liked it.  The first song I listened to was "Soup for the Past."  That is the only song I have heard from them so far.  I liked it and I think they have a great band.  I think they will grow in popularity if they keep doing what they are doing.  I do not think they will grow in popularity because the album is not very creative or original.  I think they are good live and I think they will continue to improve.  I do think they will try to continue to do what they are doing.  I do not think they will change anything on their style.  I think they will continue to improve, but they will not change what they are doing because they will be just as good as they were before.  This band is good and I think they will continue to be good.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite CDs of all time.  It is an overview of the history of the Beatles in a very moving style.  They don't play all the songs on this CD.  They play only a few but they do play many with humor and poignancy.  The songs chosen to be included are:  Strawberry Fields Forever  I Want to Hold Your Hand  I'm Down  All You Need Is Love  I Feel Fine  Please Please Me  I Am the Walrus  I'll Cry Instead  Hey Jude  I Saw Her Standing There  Please Please Me  She Loves You  She Loves You Too  She Loves You (She's My Kind of Thing).  The recording quality is excellent.  The sound is clear and well balanced.  The performances are very good.  The CD is well worth the money.

Amazon review: The only thing missing from this release is a remix or "re-recording" of the track 'I'm Down' by The Beatles.  I have often wondered why there has been no're-recording' by John Lennon, George Harrison, Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr.  The reason is simple.  They were not alive when this song was recorded by The Beatles.  The recording was done in June 1966 by George Martin at Abbey Road Studios.  The song was originally written on 6 June 1966.  In July 1966 the song was played in the Beatles' last concert at Shea Stadium in New York.  It was recorded again at Abbey Road Studios in June 1967.  The song was never played at any Beatles concert since it was never officially released.  It has been sitting in a vault in Abbey Road Studios since then.  The song is a very good example of a great song that was never officially released.

I have listened to a couple of Beatles songs that I have not heard in this collection.  One is a song by The Beatles that I have never heard.  The other is a Beatles song that I have heard several times but not recorded.  The songs are:  A Day in the Life  Please Please Me  I've Got a Feeling  Good Day Sunshine  I'll Follow the Sun  I Feel Fine  Do You Want to Know a Secret  I Want to Hold Your Hand  I Am the Walrus  You've Got to Hide Your Love Away  I'm Down  Please Please Me  I'm Happy Just to Dance with You.  The recording quality is excellent.  The sound is clear and well-balanced.  The performances are very good.  The songs are worth to me listening to.  I would definitely recommend this CD.

The songs on the third copy are very good, but the songs on the two copies that I have given to my daughter and her boyfriend are very poor.  My daughter and her boyfriend like the songs on the two copies that I have given to my daughter and my son-in-law.  I don't know what to do.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to give to my daughter for Christmas.  However, she received the CD and the songs were not on the cover.  I was surprised.  I was very disappointed.  I was hoping to get a cover with the songs on it.  I'm not sure what to do.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD for my husband as a gift.  I thought it was a nice album and had a lot of good songs on it, but the songs are not what I was expecting.  The songs in this CD are almost all about love.  There are some great love songs and other songs that I thought were very good.  However, the songs on this CD are so bland and mundane.  They are not very interesting to me.  They are not different in any way from the other songs on this CD.  So I gave him the CD and he is listening to it all day long and he says he likes it.  I don't understand why he likes it.  There are just so many mediocre songs.  I did not like the album.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The CD, 'What's Left of You' from the album, 'Unstoppable' is a great song. I'm glad that she has finally said what she has been saying for a long time. I was not prepared for the intensity of emotions that came out of her voice. I wasn't prepared for the pain and joy of her singing. That's what makes music great. I think it is important to remember that, not only do we need to remember the positive, but, as well, we need to remember to stop and think about the negative. I think that music has the ability to open the mind of the listener and allow them to be able to see things in a different light. That's what happened to me when I heard her singing. That's what is important to the true artist.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't listened to much contemporary Christian music since I stopped listening to Christian radio. I didn't know what to expect from Jewel. I thought she would be a great singer, but I was also expecting more of a soulful, beautiful voice. I was not disappointed. Her voice is powerful and she is able to sing in a way that makes you feel like you are right in the room with her. Her vocals are deep, yet at the same time she can sing in a beautiful soft voice that is so refreshing. I like the songs that she has sung. I enjoy hearing her sing the songs that I enjoy. I don't think it is any coincidence that I have enjoyed some of her songs more than most of the artist I have listened to. Her music is not so much about the lyrics as it is about the emotion of the lyrics. This is a great album to listen to. I recommend it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of her music since the beginning. I was really excited when I heard her as a singer. I don't think I even knew she was going to be a country music singer. Now I feel like she is actually a great country singer. I don't think I have ever heard her sing any of her biggest hits. I am surprised that she has been able to do so well with her new label. I think she is a great singer and will definitely be a big star.

Amazon review: I have always loved Jewel's voice. I have been waiting for her to release a new recording. I was glad when she did. It was great. Her songs are great.

Her songs are not so much about the lyrics as they are about the emotion of the lyrics. This is a great album to listen too. I recommend it.

Amazon review: Her voice is amazing. It is beautiful and it can make you feel like you are right there with her! Her voice is very deep and it has a very soulful quality to it.

I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves Jewel's music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Jewel's music. I just don't know why she would think that she can do this with the same sound and style that she has done in the past. I really hope that she finds a way to bring the same quality to all of her music that she has done
