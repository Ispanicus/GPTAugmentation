Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to put music on my computer when I am not playing music.  I don't have a cd player at home.

She calls the police to come get me.  I was nice to her in the meantime and she said "listen to the band when it is on"

Amazon review: I bought this collection because it had the best selections of what I thought was the best in heavy metal.  I got the compilation album and I don't know what I am going to do with it.

If I want more than one album, I will buy it, but if I want to buy two albums, I will not.  I am going to listen to the Death Or Glory CD and then the Death Or Glory album.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: This album is a lot more focused than the previous ones.  The lyrics are a bit more serious, and the music is not as frantic as before.  The vocals go down a little lower on this one.  The production is still very good.  I'm not sure what makes this album different than the last one, but it definitely has the same beat.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am just like the others.  I like this kind of music, but I don't think I need a lot of different genres in one album.  I would rather buy one album to really know something about an artist.  This one has enough songs to give you an idea, but not enough to really get you into the artist.  "Me" was one of my favorite albums of the year, but it's not really a great album.

Amazon review: This album has the same beats, same sound, same production.  I don't know how this album is better than the last album.

It seems like a lot of people are giving them high ratings based on their reviews when they really don't know anything about them.  The album overall is ok, if you are a fan of rap-rock, and you like the lyrics, I think this is a good album, but not a great one.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: If you like Toni Braxton, this is a good album.  It's not great, but it's pretty good.  The album has a nice balance of good songs (e.g. Collide/Girlfriend) and mediocre songs, but there are several great tracks, and a couple of bad ones.  The song "Collide" is a great example of the artist at her best.  It's really beautiful.  If you like her, this is a good one to add to your collection.

Amazon review: I liked this album a lot.  I think it has a nice balance between songs for most of the songs are good.  I like the song "You Don’t Know", and another one called "Collide".

The song "I Don’t Need Your Love" is one of the best songs on the album.  But I don’t think the album is that great.  The rest of the songs are ok.  They are like the good songs to go with the bad songs.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle."

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band since high school. I was introduced to them by a friend who lives in the same town I do. I was a huge fan and I have loved them ever since. Unfortunately, I was a big fan of the original band that was formed by their guitarist, but they stopped performing together. I was always hoping that I could see them live somewhere. It is extremely disappointing to find out that they stopped performing together and disbanded. I was always hoping that I could see the band live somewhere and now I will never ever see them again. I have never been disappointed in a band before. I thought that with this band I would be able to see them live, but I will be very sad to never see them again. I have seen them over the past three years at least twice a year, or so I was told. I have also seen them at least once a year since they started playing their shows, and I have seen them in the past year or so. It is disappointing to know that I will never ever see them again. I always hoped that they would reunite, but it is disappointing to hear the news.

I would say it is a good tune that I can listen to over and over again without ever hearing the same one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the album, as all the songs I listed above are just perfect for the average person and I love the different styles that they chose.  But, unfortunately it does not leave me feeling excited about listening to it again.  I have listened to it multiple times with different songs and can't get the feeling of excitement and happiness back.  I do like the album and it can be a great album for someone who is looking for a "feel good" album, but for me, it just doesn't have the same feeling as my other favorites.  I would say it's a great for beginners and a great album for the fans of the artist but not a good one for me.

Amazon review: This album sucks!  I have a lot of negative thoughts about this album.  First of all, I would not recommend it, or even buy it if you are not a music buff.  Second, it does not have the same song that I would like.  Third, it is very repetitious.  Fourth, I think the song is over produced.  Fifth, I think it could be better.  Sixth, it is in very bad taste (how do you think this album came out?).  Seventh, it just plain sucks!  Eight, I am sure this record is a complete waste of money.  Nine, it should have been a comedy, not a "serious" album.  Ten, the music videos suck.  Eleven, this is not a good, or even an average album.

Amazon review: I don't know what to think of this album, it's not my favorite album, but it's not a bad album.  It's good for a laugh.  It's not a good album for listening to over and over again.  I don't know what to think of most of the songs on this album.  I don't like the vocals, or the production.  I don't know why the songs have lyrics, I hate them.  I didn't like the cover.  But I will buy another album from this artist because I like the song.  I would not recommend this album, but it's not a bad album.

Amazon review: This album has really good songs, it's just that they all seem to be the same.  There are a few songs that I like better than the others, but most of them are just repetitive.

Amazon review: This album rocks and I'm not a huge fan of it.  My favorite song was "I Don't Wanna Cry" because it was so original to me.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: It's a very good album, I like the music but I really think it would have been better if the album had included more songs. All in all I think it would've been a good album but it would have been better if it made me want to listen to more of the songs before I bought it.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: The first song I put on here was the first track that I thought of for this list, and it's what made me do it.   It's just not my cup of tea, but for some people it might be.  I can see where people get it and where they don't, but this song is one of the few that has a real hook and really moves you.  If you're into that sort of music, with some sort of attitude, check it out.

Amazon review: I don't really like the whole post-hardcore scene, but I like this and many other songs from this artist, especially those with a heavy guitar sound.   If you don't like hardcore, you might not like this, but I feel like the song has a good rock/metal feel to it, with the vocalist's guitar style.  It's not the most unique song in the world, but if you like classic rock/metal, you can definitely get it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:   My favorite.  It's a really good song and it's worth owning.   The vocals are pretty good, with a nice rock/metal sound to the song, and the guitar's pretty solid as well, with a lot of good solos.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I can't really find much wrong with this song, which might have something to do with me not liking the music style, but really it's a pretty good song.  I just think that if you like the music style, this isn't for you, but if you don't the song is a good one.  I am pretty sure that it was recorded in the studio, with a decent sound, and that it's not some cheesy radio station song either.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:   I know that I can't really find much wrong with this song, but I can say that I like it.  The vocals are okay, and there are some good guitar chords and solos, and the song is still really good.

Amazon review:   This is a great song, and I like how the guitar sounds.  The bass is a little on the weak side, but I guess that's the point.  The vocals are pretty great, especially the last bit.  It's a good song, but it does make me kind of want to listen to the next one, which has a much more powerful chorus and guitar sound.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:   A little out of place for me.  I don't really like this style of music, but this is a really good song.  I like how the guitars ring out and how the vocals sound.  I don't think that this is a unique song either.  I'm sure that it was recorded in a studio with good equipment, and that it's not some random radio station song either.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon product review:  I really like this song, and I can see why it's on this list.  It has a good, hard rock sound to it, with a lot of good guitar and guitar solos.  The vocals are pretty good, and I really like the way that this song ends, with a good, heavy guitar sound.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:   I think that this song is okay, but it's nothing special and it's a little out of place in this list.  The only thing I really like is that it's not really all that good, but it's still a good song.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Music review:
Review by Jeff: My first impression was that the song selection was a little light on songs from the Shotgun Angel album. The other CD's were also somewhat lacking in the song selection. This CD however has a great song selection and the vocals on all the songs are excellent. This CD is not only great to listen to, but also great to buy as it is a large collection of songs. There are also two bonus CDs included with the CD. This is now my first choice CD for purchase.

Review by Jeff: This CD is a GREAT CD! The songs on this CD are all from the Shotgun Angel album, and all of them are good. The vocalist on this CD is excellent, and the song selection is great. I have three copies in my CD player, and will buy more. I hope that this is a trend. I hope that more and more people start to listen to Cd's that are good. It is a shame that they have to make this album in the first place, but it is still a great CD.
