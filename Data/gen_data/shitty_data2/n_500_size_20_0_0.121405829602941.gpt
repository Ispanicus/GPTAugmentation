Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: A collection of songs, very different in sound.  The songs are very good and the vocals are really good, but the narration is way off in spots.  There is one song with a really good chorus, but it's just so off in the narration.  Other songs just sound bad with the narration.

Amazon review:  The narrator is very good, but not very creative.  He is not able to give us the true story of the song.  I think this is his first attempt at narration.  He is not bad, just off.  I don't know, but I have to give it a lower 5 star rating just because of his narration.

Amazon review: I love Dylan because he speaks about everyday life and about the struggles people go through.  He isn't afraid to speak his mind and to tell the truth.  I love him because he wrote about real life situations.  He wrote about real life people, and people who are living in real life situations.  I love Dylan because he is very unique.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.

I think it would be nice to know that you can not tell who owns the album by looking at the label or the inner sleeve but I guess we can't complain.

Amazon review:  The song "You're All I Need" from the American Songbook is a great song, but I have no idea why anyone would want to listen to this song, or any song from this collection, ever again.  It's a shame that the rest of the songs are good, and this song is one of the worst.  Not only is the quality of the song and the vocals, but the song's lyrics are absolutely nonsensical.  "You're all I need but you don't need me."  "You can always tell what I'm thinking but I can't tell what you're thinking."  "You don't need me to hold you."  "I don't need anybody else!"  I don't understand why anyone would listen to this song.  It's just a waste of time.  Even though it's not a big hit, it's not a bad song.  I just don't understand why anyone would want to listen to this album.  I only bought this CD because I had heard that this album was coming out.  I wish they would have gone one step further and released a CD with a more normal song selection.  It would have been a better album and would have sold better.  I would have bought the other albums on the American Songbook CD, but I've learned my lesson.  I don't want to buy albums I don't like.

Amazon review:  The American Songbook is a collection of songs by a variety of different artists.  I don't know that I would say it is a "rock" album, but it is a different approach to the music that most of the other rock bands do.  I think of this type of music as folk, the more commercial sound of rock.  I also think of this type of music as a very personal form of art.  There is a certain intimacy in listening to a song like "You're All I Need" sung by Rod Stewart.  The song is good, it's a good song even though it doesn't do anything for me musically, but it is a good song and a lot of good songs have come from this album.  I like the fact that this album has a number of different artists from different genres.  This makes for a wider variety of music.  This is why I bought this album.  The lyrics to all the songs are meaningful.  I cannot even say what all the songs are about.  I just like the music.  I don't understand why anyone would want to listen to this album.  It's just a waste of time.

Amazon review:  This is not a bad album.  I haven't been a Rod Stewart fan for a long time, but this album is good.  I think it will be hard to top in his best years.  It has the song "You're All I Need" which he is better known for, but the song "My Girl" has a nice melody.  The song "Sally's Gone" has a nice melody, but I don't think Rod sings it to the same tune as the rest of the songs.  He always seems to sing the song "Sally" to the same tune.  The song "You Can't Take It" is kind of funny.  It is not a bad song, but it is not what I expected from him.  I think he is better known for "You Can't Take It" but I am okay with that.

I'm a huge Prince fan and I was really disappointed with this album. I mean, the album got a lot of playing, but the quality of the songs was terrible. First off, I don't see how it was possible to lose all the songs on this album. Second, I don't know how you can lose a tune like "I Wanna Be Your Lover" but I can't. Third, I was really disappointed because these songs were good. I love the melody and the lyrics of "I'll Be There" and "I'll Be There". I don't understand why people love these songs so much. Fourth, I don't understand why Prince has to play "Just Another Day" and "I Wanna Be Your Lover" for the last song. I don't understand why he has to play a song like "Little Red Corvette" because it's a hit. I don't understand why he has to play "I Feel Love" because it's not one of his best hits. Fifth, the songs are good, but Prince plays them

He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.

Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I got this album at Best Buy and I was surprised at how good it was. I bought it because I was going to buy a new guitar, but while I was listening to this album, I realized that I already had a guitar, so I didn't need a new one, but I still had the one I had. This album is also a great way to listen to the original sound of the band.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I always get a kick out of the songs on the Head And The Heart! Not only are they very catchy, but they are just beautiful and soooooooo good!  This song was one of my faves!  I would have bought it without a doubt!  But I found the whole production to be pretty bad.  It just didn't make any sense!  It had a pretty good beat but it sounded like a cheap drum machine.  At the very least it was a horrible mistake to have made.  I wonder how many other people were taken in by "All By Myself"?  I'm so disappointed!  I will have to wait and see if someone else also finds this as a good song.

Amazon review:  I have never heard music like this.  I am always looking for songs to play in my car that are fun and easy to listen to on the way.  This song is just such a perfect song to listen to while driving.  It is a great song that will make you feel happy and calm.  It has the right notes for the right mood.  It is easy to listen to and is great for driving in your car.  This song is just perfect!  I can't wait to listen to the whole album.

Amazon review: I love this song!  I have listened to it a million times before and  I now listen to it when I am alone, driving or on the train.  It makes me feel so good!  I have never heard a song put a smile on my face like this song!  I love it!  I have heard it on the radio and I wanted to try it for myself.  I found it on Amazon and I bought it.  It is just a great song.  I am not sure how to explain it but it really does something for me.  It makes me feel happy and excited to be alive.  It makes me feel more alive than I already am.  This song makes me feel happy.  I don't know how the producers get their money.  I just wish they would work harder on the song.  It is just the way I like it and I guess that is why I like it so much.  I would buy this song again!  I don't care how expensive this is, I would still buy it.  The song is great!  I would buy it over and over again!  This is the kind of song I need!

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

But it is a good album from what I could tell.  Don't be all up in arms over it.  It really does not deserve to have a low rating.  I know it is not that great but if you are a fan of a band and want to hear their best album then you should at least listen to this one.  I did not like it but I did like it.  I'm not sure what makes you think you can rate this album higher then the one you rated.  I'm sorry but I won't waste my time writing another review of this album.  Sorry, but you can't do that.

Amazon review: My first album of Slipknot was the excellent Slipknot and then the less than stellar Slipknot III.  I was looking forward to this one since it was announced to be the last one.  I have listened to this album over and over again with more than 25 minutes of my own listening.  I think I can say that I have enjoyed this album.  I wouldn't say it is a great album but it is good.  I didn't like about this album but I liked it.  The vocals are very important to me.  If there was a better singer then I would not be disappointed.  I would like to have heard a better drummer with Corey once more if possible.  But as it is I enjoyed not having to worry about those things.

Amazon review: I have a great record collection and i am trying to build a good collection.  I have been listening to Slipknot albums in the past 3 years.  I have listened to Slipknot, Slipknot III, Slipknot IV and Slipknot V.  I really don't listen to much of their albums any more so i just don't have a good collection to begin with so i have to start somewhere.  Slipknot III was my first album of Slipknot.  It was my first purchase of a Slipknot album.  It was released in the fall of 2005.  I was really excited when I got it and i have listened to it more than 20 times already.  There are songs i really liked it was very interesting and good at the same time.  But I could never get over the song "New Divide" I couldn't get over that song. It was just so much better than the rest of the album.  When i got to the end of the album i was really disappointed.  Some songs were amazing and others were just okay.  I don't know if the sound quality was to blame for my low rating but I'm glad you rated this as well since you enjoyed it as much as I did.  I think the album could have been a lot better if they had a better singer and better drummer.  I don't know if that makes sense but I really don't care.  I did enjoy myself listening to this album.

Amazon review: What a great song.  This song is one of the few times that I remember actually enjoying Slipknot's music.  I have been listening to a lot of Slipknot since their inception.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This is a very underrated song.  I don't know what the real deal is with the song, but the fact that it was released by the band itself and made a major label debut tells you all you have to know about them.

Amazon review: I heard this song at a show a few years back and I have been a fan since then; I've listened to their music on my drive to work and I have listened to it at night before going to sleep.  It's a catchy song; I would say it would have been a great choice for the theme song of a show.  However, for the reason stated, I'm not sure I would want to listen to it on a movie soundtrack.  As it was too close to the song that was playing, it didn't really fit well.  I understand that this was a studio recording, which makes the song even more special than it is, but the vocal quality and arrangement (just not the song) is a big letdown.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the best song on the album.  It's a ballad with a great melody and lyrics.  If I had to choose a favorite, it would be this one.  I love the "My eyes are like stars in the sky/You just make me cry" line at the end.  I also like how the lyrics are sung over the guitar and the piano, which adds to the effect. I didn't really give this particular song a chance until I read a review on Amazon, where it was compared to a song by Sia.  I don't know if this was the reason, but I felt the song was a bit off the "Sia sound" for me.  I think I would have preferred a more traditional ballad with a rockier sound.  It's not bad, but it's not as good as the rest of the songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a pretty good song.  It has a great melody and rhythm.  I didn't quite like the "dancing" sound that this song makes, but I do like it very much.  I'm not sure what the deal is with the chorus, but it's definitely up there as my favorite on the album.  I think it's the best song on the whole album.  It's not a "classic" song, but it's a very good song.  It just doesn't seem to fit the rest of the album and that's why it's the best.  It's by far the best song on the whole CD.  I can't understand why it wasn't on the album.  It sounds like it would fit perfectly.  I really like the melody and the lyrics.  The "dancing" sound is a little weird, but it's not bad.  I liked the song the first time I heard it, but I didn't like the second time I heard it.  I think I would have liked the song the second time better, but it's just not a "classic" song.  I think it would have fit better on the second album, where the other songs are more traditional and the ballads are a little more emotional.  I'm sorry that I don't think this song is a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth listening to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The song starts out with a short and sweet guitar riff.  It keeps the same melody and rhythm for most of the song.  The only thing is that it seems to me that the guitar part is a little too long in the beginning and it really gets in your face.  I don't know what the deal is with the guitar part, but I didn't like it the first time I heard it.  I do like the melody and lyrics.  The chorus is very powerful and the lyrics really hit home.  I liked the song the first time I heard it, but it doesn't hold up well to the rest of the songs on this CD.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I've been waiting for a CD from the Verve for a while now, and this is it.  It's a good album, but I can't really comment on the quality, because I don't know what to compare it to.  The lyrics are great, the production is nice, and even the songs are good.  The only problem is that it's not as good as other great Verve albums.

Amazon review:  This album is probably the best Dylan album of all time, so I want to get a copy.  The lyrics are great, the vocals are great, the production is great, and the songs are great.  I never knew Dylan had these great lyrics, and I never knew Dylan had these great songs, but I did know that he had great songs.  I've been waiting for a CD from the Verve for ages, and this is it.  This album is probably the best Dylan album of all time, so this album is an excellent buy.

Amazon review:  I bought this album as a freebie, and I really like it, I just don't think it's going to be good enough to go on tour with the Verve.

I've been waiting for a CD from the Verve since the summer of 2006, and I'm glad I waited.  This album is probably the best Dylan album of all time, and I bought it as a freebie, so you can do it yourself.

Amazon review:  This song is really different from the original BFS song. It's not just a re-recording of the song with a different tempo and instrumentation. It's the song that BFS fans are waiting for.  I have to say I like the new song better than the original BFS song.  The original BFS is a musical masterpiece.  And I think the new one is better too.  That's my opinion.   The original was beautiful and it's a shame that the BFS fans can't get the original.   Good job, BFS!  Your fans are going to be happy.
