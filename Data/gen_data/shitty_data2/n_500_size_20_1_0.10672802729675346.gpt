Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: The whole thing.  I'm not one for the whole album thing, but this album I just love.  The first song is 'The Last Time' which is pretty much what the whole album is about, and then you go into 'Walking Without Falling' and the rest of the songs are just great.  The music is great, the lyrics are great, the production is great, the harmonies are great, and best of all, the band is great!  The members of this band have been together for a long time and they can play.  I find the songs on the album to be very reminiscent of the band's previous works.

Amazon review: I was introduced to this band by my sister who is a huge fan.  She is a great singer and it was hard to keep her from singing the theme song to the show "The Good Guys Win" but i got through it.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  It's not that great but they've done the best they can with it.  I really like that they have tried to capture the feel of the original band and not have it sound too close to it.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review:  I don't really like the song that is right after the first track on the CD.  It seems like if you just listen to the song you can't think of a reason to continue.  So if you don't like the first track, and the song after the first track, then that is the one you should skip.  Then the one after the first and then the song after the second track.  That way you will have the whole album to listen to.  I really like the music on this album.  And I like the fact that it has a unique sound and i like the fact that it doesn't sound like a normal hip hop record.

Amazon review:  I think this album is very good.  I have been toying with the idea of buying this album, but I haven't found it yet.  It's a very personal album, so i can't say i really like it (yet).  I would say it's good but i think that the bad songs outweigh the good songs.

It's not really a hip hop album at all, I don't think it's a rap album, or at least not one of the best rap albums of the year.  I think it's more of an album that's more like a mix of jazz and hip hop than it is like rap or jazz.  I think this album is a very good album.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

The "You and Me" is another Cole Porter classic sung by Mary Martin.  It's a wonderful duet.  "Why Shouldn't I" is a good song, but there is nothing wrong with this version, and it doesn't sound so bad compared to some other recordings.

Mary Martin is a fine vocalist.

On "We'll Meet Again", Ray Sinatra takes the song's original melody, and expands it for a modern jazz arrangement.  "Always True To You" is another Cole Porter standard, with Mary Martin singing it.  It's a lovely song, and you can sing it with Mary Martin if you want.

I've been in love with the Danse Macabre piece and the Vivaldi piece and then I've been in love with the Brahms piece and now I'm in love with this new piece which I've never heard and it's terrible. I have no idea what the hell this piece is supposed to be about, it sounds like a really terrible piece of music. I actually like the Mozart piece a little bit better. I really do NOT like this CD.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

This book is not only boring and annoying, but also very pointless to listen to and I'm so sick of these people that are saying how great it is. The music is not great and the story is terrible. I wish I would never have wasted the money spent on this book.

Amazon review: I bought this book on CD and have listened to it on many occasions. I can imagine that it was a good gift for someone. I can't believe that the author had to use this book to get the money for his book and music. This book is poorly written and poorly edited. I hope this author never gets another dime from his book. The music isn't very good and the story is way to long. It just has to be finished and be out of the book.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I had to have all of the songs on this CD.  It's just so beautiful and I can't get enough of it.  It goes from one end of the song to the other, with some of the more upbeat songs having a slower tempo.  The melody is catchy and the lyrics are very touching and touching.  
My only complaint is that I wish she was a little more dramatic in the singing.  Some of the lyrics are very dark and I would prefer a little more comedy.  But that's besides the point.  I really enjoyed the songs and I think they should be more widely distributed.  They're catchy and they have a nice sound.  I can totally see this CD being played in a nursing home as well.  I can definitely get a lot of enjoyment out of this CD.  I would like to see this CD being released as a full album.  I want to buy the CD because I want to have it all.

Amazon review: This CD is so beautiful!  I have been searching for this CD all over town.  It's not available in stores.  The CD was originally released in 2004 but is still in print.  I know that I am giving this bad review but I just can't get past the horrible singing.  It's not that the singing is bad, it's just that it's just so horrible.  The vocals are very low and scratchy.  It sounds as if she's shouting the lyrics which is horrible.  The song "The Lord Is My Shepherd" is very beautiful.  She's been singing that song all over town.  She is singing it very beautifully and I love that song.  I don't know why this CD is so horrible.  I have been searching for this CD all over town and I just can't find it anywhere.  I heard about this CD through one of the staff at my church.  This is a good, Christian CD.  I would suggest that if you don't see this CD in stores, you go look for it.  I love the music.  I could listen to this CD all day long.

The songs on this CD are very inspirational, beautiful, and touching.

It comes with a CD of beautiful background music so you can have something to listen to and enjoy.

I thought I'd post these reviews because I've been getting a lot of positive feedback for my reviews...even from other reviewers. I have a few things to say about the movie though...
1)The movie is a bit hard to hear in the beginning. I thought this was a good thing, because it made it more of a special effects movie. But I noticed that the volume was turned up way too high in the beginning. I had to turn it down to get the movie to work.
2) I thought the movie was very inspiring and powerful. But there were a few parts that I thought were a bit boring. The scenes with the kids crying really stuck with me.
3) The ending was a bit lame. The movie was over in 10 minutes. It's a good thing that the movie was over in 10 minutes...the ending was a bit lame.
4) I thought it was very educational. I'm not a religious person, but I think the message is very powerful. If you don't like it, don't watch it. But if you're looking for a movie that teaches a message, especially about faith, then this is a must see.
If you want to see the movie...go to DVD.com and look up the movie title. Once it is on the screen, search on Amazon, Goodwill, or Amazon.ca and you'll find it.
I'll be back later with my review.

It's been a while since my last review. I have a couple of changes to make. The first being that I have a better camera. I have a Canon Rebel T3i with a 16-55 mm lens. I have a few different lenses and I think this one is the best for this movie. Now for the second change. I have completely forgotten who the director of this movie is. So I'm going to repost my review here.
It was quite an interesting movie, but it was also very hard to understand. I will say that it is a bit difficult to hear in the beginning. I thought it was a good thing because it made it more of a special effect movie. But I noticed that the volume was turned up way too high, and the movie was hard to hear in the beginning. I had to turn it down a bit to get it to work.
The movie had a very spiritual message. It was very inspirational. I thought it was very educational. I'm not a religious person, so I thought the message was very powerful. I think the movie was very hard to understand. The scenes with the kids crying really stuck with me.
The ending was a bit lame. The movie was over in 10 minutes. A good thing that the movie was over in 10 minutes. The ending was a bit lame. The movie was over in 10 minutes and I think it was a good thing.
I thought it was very educational. I'm not a religious person, so it is hard for me to understand the movie, especially in the beginning. If you don't like it, don't watch it. But, if you're looking for a movie that teaches a message, especially about Faith, then this is a must see.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the weakest album of the band's career, and I'm unsure if it's the product of a lack of confidence in the band or a desire to reach out to a wider audience.  Either way, it's a waste of a band's time, and an example of an album that could have been great had they tried something different.  "Ahead of the Storm" is a weak start to a decent album, but it's the kind of thing that could have been a great, if not a top-five album, had they tried something different.  The fact that the rest of the songs on this album are all similar, boring, generic and uninteresting, makes this album a huge letdown.

Amazon review: I don't want to write a review on the album, because I can't.  But if you have any interest in this band, you might like it.  They are from New Jersey, and their sound is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a band from that state.  They play a pretty big, metalcore influenced sound, but not as big as some others.  I'm not a huge fan of this album, but it does have a few good songs, and I'm not going to write a review on it, because I don't want to.

Amazon review: I never liked the sound of this band.  The band never had a good song, and the album has a lot of generic sound, the band plays the same way throughout the album.  I haven't tried the album yet, but I have heard some of the songs, and they sound like nothing I've heard.  They are from Chicago, I don't know why they started playing that sound, but I can tell you that it is a generic, generic sound.

Amazon review: This album is good, but it's not something I would listen to.  I don't like how the band tries to do what is different from what is popular, and it just comes out to be bland.  The album starts off with a good song, "The Truth", but there are only a few other songs I would consider good, and even those are not really great.  The vocals on this album are really bad.  The band also tries to do the same sound again and again, which is really bland.  They never had a good song, and they don't try anything different from what they are doing.  I would listen to this album, but it's just not worth it.

Amazon review: As far as the music is concerned, this is the worst album that I have ever heard.  I don't know why, but I've always disliked this band, and this album is no exception.  This is the only band I've ever stopped listening to, because they had too much music on there, and I thought it was too much.  I don't know why, but this band never had a good song, and just tried to do the same thing over and over again.  This is the worst band I've ever listened to.  The lyrics didn't sound good, and the vocals were so bad.  They had so many good songs, but they just wouldn't let me listen to them.  It was just too many songs.  They played the same old song over and over again.  The album just sounds boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a boring album, with very generic, uninteresting sound.  There are no real good songs on this album, and the worst song on this album is really, really stupid.  The vocals aren't that bad, but I'm not interested in this album at all.

Amazon review: This album got stuck in my head.  I know they are from Illinois, but it is the most generic, boring, generic album of theirs I've ever heard.  I don't understand why they never tried to do something different, and why they kept doing the same thing over and over again.  They played the same type of songs, over and over again.  The cover art is awful, I don't understand why they kept the cover the same.  The lyrics just sound like some generic lyrics, and the vocals are just generic.  I can't understand why they kept repeating the same sound, and kept getting stuck in my head.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an album I would listen to if it was a gift for a friend, because it has nothing in it that I don't like.  The band plays the same sound over and over again, and I would always like to hear something different, and they never did, so that

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't really have much to say about this album. I have a lot of other albums, but its the first one that really got me into the music of the band. The reason being that I saw them in the early 90s, and I was a fan of their earlier stuff. They were one of the first acts that really rocked my socks off back then. As a matter of fact, I am currently in the process of re-listening to the old stuff from their early days, and at times, it makes me miss them. The other reason being, that I know a lot more about them now than I did back then, and they are becoming more mainstream and popular. The music they made in the late 80s and early 90s is really interesting, and I'm hoping that their latest album, "Fireflight," would be as good as the old stuff.

Amazon review: I had the opportunity to be interviewed recently by the local newspaper in my hometown of San Antonio.  I was asked what my favorite album is, and I mentioned "The Misfits" by The Rolling Stones.  So, I thought I'd share this with you.  
I don't know about you, but in the 90's, when I was 15, I would play the guitar that I currently play.  I would pick up a song by a band, and I would sing along with the lyrics, only to realize, that I didn't know the words.  I would then sing them, and I would learn them, and suddenly I could play the song.  It was so addictive, and it was something about singing with words, that I had never experienced before.  I know, its cheesy, but I am happy to share it with you.  
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I can't really think of a reason why I don't like the album.  I found it quite enjoyable in its own right, but I didn't find it to be any better than other albums I have heard.  I found it to be a good album, but I just didn't think it was better in any way than other albums.  I'm kind of a music junkie, and I like to listen to music that is unique, and different from what I'm used to listening to.  I think that this album is unique and different, but I don't think it's better.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a little over a month now.  Sometimes I will listen to it for an hour or two and I will have to put it down, or I will get up to leave the room.  But, at other times, I will be listening to it for a period of time, and I will have to continue to play it.  It has something for everyone, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  I think that if you like old school rock and roll, then you will enjoy it.  If you like something a little different from that, then you will like it.  This is one of those albums that I will listen to for an hour, and then I will have to put it down, but it will come back to me again the next day.  I think that this is a good album, and I would recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: I love the music of these guys and I have been a fan of their band since the late 80's.  But, I have not heard them in a few years, and I think that they have fallen off the map.  They are very popular in Texas, and I believe that because of the music that they play.  I think that if I was to go back to check out some of their old songs, I would like to hear them again.  I have heard some great songs by them, but I just don't think that they could do any better than they did back in the 80's.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like the song, "I'm Only The One". I like the music, and the lyrics, and I like the sound of the vocals.  I enjoy the music, and I enjoy the lyrics as well, so I think that I can enjoy the music as well as I enjoy the lyrics.  I have always enjoyed this song, and I haven't heard it for a while, so I think that it will be a good one to come back to.
