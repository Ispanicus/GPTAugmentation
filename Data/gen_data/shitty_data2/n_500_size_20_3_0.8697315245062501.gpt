Amazon review: I love their sound and the song. It is wonderful. I love Michael and Shania and I love Michael's voice. I love that they have taken the same approach of singing together as they have in the past, and it works for both of them. It makes me really happy when I hear them sing. I think it's really cool for me to see them sing together. I think it's a good sign for their longevity as a duo. They have a great chemistry together and I think that's another reason why their music has gotten better with time. They've always had a special kind of musical chemistry between them.

I'm pretty sure that if you had a million dollars, you would name your new car the Michael and Shania Carter.

The boys from the band, Michael and Shania Carters, have done it again. This time they have decided to start a new album with a new single called 'I Am Your Angel', which is all about love.

This album was recorded over the course of about a month and a half, and it was produced by Chris Galland, who has worked with them before. There are only two songs that have been recorded on this album that have been released to date, but they will be released soon in the future.

This album will hit you in your heart.

This is what it looks like when Michael and Shania want to make a beautiful love song.

This would be my kind of love song.

This is the sound of a happy couple.

This is the sound of a love song that is a little more than just a love song.

I hope you are all as excited as I am about the new album. If you haven't heard it yet, you can listen to it here:

Michael and Shania Carters - I Am Your Angel

I just want to thank Michael and Shania for giving me this opportunity to do this review.

This is my first time reviewing a Michael and Shania album, and it is a pretty big deal for me to say this, but I am so happy that I was able to do it. I love Michael

I don't like the songs that are offered but it is nice to have a place to find new music.  I am a musician and play in an all-star band.  We play in several bands and we also have a small record label.  This site has helped us to get the word out and get more people to find out more about us and our music.  I have been a fan of the group since I was a child and it has been a blessing and a curse.  I feel like this site has helped us to make it a blessing.  I was able to get a song out there and it is going to be played on a CD we are making.  The song was written by one of our members.  It was meant for him to have it and I am very happy that he did.  The song is called "How can I get you out of my head (I love you so much)".  It was meant for him to sing to his girlfriend in his head.  She is an amazing person and I am happy to have found the lyrics for this song.  The song is dedicated to her and we are happy to have a song dedicated to her.  I feel like it is very meaningful and it will help us to get out of our heads and find peace and joy.  That's what it's all about.

It's really a shame, because after listening to this album, I could not imagine life without Korn. I mean, they're one of the most important bands in metal right now. The only reason I gave this a 5-star is because of the live concert aspect of this album which I'm not a huge fan of.

Amazon review: This is another one of those albums that I can't put on a CD player without first listening to it on my own so I won't review it until I've had a couple of listens in my own room. The first thing I noticed about this album is that it sounds like the members of Korn are in a band together. They all have different voices and styles and different vocalizations. All of the songs on the album sound like they could be played in the same room with one drummer, but then, with the instruments and vocals, some of them just don't fit in with one another.

Amazon review: This is Korn's first album since the departure of lead singer, Dave Bickhardt. The album does not seem to be a serious attempt to recapture the spirit of their previous albums, and I have to admit that I do not feel a great deal of emotion towards it. Although they have a lot of quality songs, I do not find myself having the same feelings that I had towards their previous albums.

###
Amazon review: This is a good album to listen to if you're looking for something more in the vein of Korn's previous albums. They still have their own brand of heavy metal and they still have those hard hitting tracks, but there is a lot of substance to this album. The first two songs are really the only ones that are not very good, but after that you start to feel the real Korn. A lot of the songs on this CD are heavy, but not in the same way that you feel when listening to Korn. The lyrics on this CD are more about life than in the past. The members of Korn have matured since they began and have a more mature sound now. The new members of Korn have the right attitude, and are more in line with the way that the band should sound.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Alicia Keys. I was so excited when I found out that she was on the new album I was working on. So you can imagine my disappointment when I discovered that her song was not on it. I tried so hard to be patient and I really wanted to hear what she had to say and I did not get it. I would have rather have had this song and listened to it multiple times. I feel like I wasted my money on this.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, but I think this album is simply a bore.  I've had too much other music to find the fun in this album.  I can't understand what she's trying to accomplish here.  I can't understand why I bought the CD - it just sounds like a lot of other boring stuff.  I was disappointed but not surprised by this album - she's a talented writer, but she makes songs that are basically just'songs.

Amazon review: My children are older now, so this is a great time for me to listen to some of her older, but still good songs.  I really want to like her new album, and I'm not sure why.  I was waiting for her to make a really good album, and I don't get it.  I'm sorry, but I think this album is just another boring, uninspired album that she should have left alone.  That's all I have to say about this album.  I'm not the only one who is disappointed by this album.  The CD was not a disappointment to me.  I've listened to it enough.  I'm just frustrated that she's not just making good, quality, quality material.

There's no good songs in here.  There's nothing in here that I like.  It's just an album of songs that are all songs.  And the songs that are songs are nothing good.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Lyrics

It's easy to get lost in the music

To lose yourself in the beat

To lose yourself in the beat

It's easy to get lost in the music

To get lost in the beat

To get lost in the beat

It's easy to get lost in the music, to get lost in the beat

To get lost in the beat, to get lost in the beat

It's easy to get lost in, in the music, to get lost in the beat

To get, lost in the music, to get lost in the beat

It's easy to get, lost, in the music, to get lost in the beat

To, get, lost in the music, to get lost in the beat
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's easy to get lost in the music, to get, lost in the music, to get lost in the beat.

To get lost in the beat, to get lost in the music, to get lost in the beat.

It's easy to get lost in the music, to get lose in the music, to get lost in the beat.

To lose yourself in the beat, to lose, in the music, to get lost.

To lose ourselves, in the music, to get lost, in the music, to get lost.

It's easy to get lost in the music, to lose, in the music, to get lost.

It's easy, to get lost, in the music, to get lost, in the music, to, get lost.

To lose, ourselves, in the music, to get lost, in the music, in the music, to get lost.

It's easy get, lost, in the music, to get lost, in the music, in, the music, to get lost.

To get, lost, in the music, to get lost, in the beat, to get lost, in the beat, in the music, to get lost.

It's easy easy get lost, in the music, to get lost, in the music.

It's easy to get lost in the music, to, lose, in the music, to get lost.

To lose, ourselves, in the music, the music, to get lost, in the music, in the music.

To lose, ourselves, in the music, the music.

It's easy to get lost in the music.

Get lost in the music.

It's easy to get, lost, in the music, in the music.

To get, lost, in the music.

Get lost in the music.

Get lost in the music.

Get, lost, in the music, to, get lost in the music, to, to get lost in the music.

It's easy to get lost in the, in the music, to, get lost in the music.
