Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I am a huge (and terrible) music fan. I had a few friends that would play songs for me. It's one of the things that I really like about the internet. Now, I was given this album by a friend of mine because he thought it was a great album. I'm not a big fan of his music, but I was really, really into this album. After I found the album, I was like, "Wow, this is actually really good." And the album is really good. It is just very mediocre. It is pretty good, but it's also pretty mediocre. (And I'm not sure what this means. But I love the album.) I think I'm going to get this album. I've already bought it twice. The first time I bought it, I could not download it. It would take forever. I couldn't even download it from my iTunes. I called my friend and he tried to get me an email address for the Amazon page, but I didn't have one. I had one for the iTunes page, but it said that it was not a valid email. So, I never got it. It was never even on the Amazon page. I ended up buying it again for $8 from another website. I had to wait for the music to download and then it would play on my iPod. I then had to make a second payment to Amazon.com. The second time I bought it, I had the same problem. So, I called the company and they said that they are working on it and said that it should come up soon. So, I'm going to have to wait. I'm just hoping it will come up soon. I really really like this album. I'm really disappointed that it's mediocre. It is pretty good, but it is pretty mediocre.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: I could not even listen to this song for more than 5 minutes before I had to pull the headphones from my ears.  When I first heard this song, I was amazed at the beauty of the melody and the harmony in the song.  However, after listening to this song, I cannot get past the vocals.  The music is beautiful but the vocals are just plain bad.  I would not buy this song again.  I am not mad at Amazon at all, but I am mad that I just spent a few dollars on this song.

Amazon review: This song is great.  I am a lover of slow, mellow songs, and this song is absolutely perfect for the "meditation" time of day.  The lyrics are soothing, and the music is a perfect, relaxing background to any type of meditation.  This song is especially excellent for sleep and deep meditation.  I highly recommend this song to those who need a relaxing, mellow, slow song for the "mood" in their life.

Amazon review:  This song is so peaceful, I wish I had the time to sit down and listen to it all day!  I found it soothing to listen to, and I can see myself listening to it at work, and then at home, and then at night while I am reading a book.  This is such a great way to meditate, and it's perfect for this time of year.  I am not sure I would have ever thought to buy this music without listening to it for a bit.  This is a great purchase, and I would recommend anyone to buy it.  This is the only bad thing about this album.  It is a little too upbeat, and I feel like I am missing out on some good, relaxing music!  I would not purchase it again, and I would definitely recommend everyone to purchase this album, if you are looking for music to listen to when you meditate.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this song.  I've had it for a while, and have listened to it quite a bit.  It is a perfect, relaxing song to listen to when you are trying to fall to sleep.

Amazon review: A great new "meditation" song.  I am not an expert on meditation but once I heard this song I was sold.  I would recommend this song to anyone who is on the road or trying to meditate.  I would not recommend this song to anyone who is not a meditator.  I think if you are on the road or trying to meditate this song would be perfect.  I love this song, and I can see myself listening to it when I am trying to fall asleep.  I would recommend this song to anyone who likes peaceful music.  I do like this song, and I am glad I bought it.

I am a fan of relaxing music so I like most of the music I download, but I could not get past the vocals of this song.  I would not recommend this song to anyone.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: There's a reason that most of the top songs in the history of music are based on the blues. The lyrics, the music, the style.  There's a reason that every time you hear a hit song, it's been based on the blues.  "Foolish Heart" is a song that stands out because of its lyrical and musical content.  "If I Only Knew" is a song that plays with the heart and spirit of the blues.  "Good Morning Little Schoolgirl" is a song that's so damn good, it makes your toes curl.  "The House That Built Me" is a song that is so perfectly told and sung, not one second feels wasted.  "If This World Were to End" is a song that is so emotionally charged and is about the most honest, real song that I've ever heard.  "Sugar Magnolia" is another song that is about the most honest, real song that I've ever heard.

You have to listen to this.  You have to.  You have to.  You have to.

You take a lot from his soul.  You take a lot from his music.  He changed the way people thought about music and he made music that was so powerful, so powerful, so powerful.  He could sing and he could play the guitar.  He could play the blues.  He could sing, he could play the guitar, he could sing, he could play the guitar and he could sing.  He could sing, he could play the blues, he could play the blues, he could sing, he could play the blues, he could sing, he could play, he could play, he could play.  He was a legend, a legend, a legend.  He was a legend, a legend, a legend.  His music was not only an inspiration to me but I think to many others as well.  I think that we will always remember him for a lot of reasons.  I think he was a very special man and I think he will always be remembered as a very special man.

I was in a car accident while driving a friend home from a concert at a local arena, we were hit head on.  It is a miracle I survived, but I am so happy to have been alive and to have been able to hear Bob Johnson sing again.  I was in a terrible pain to the point where I could not even swallow.  At the time I was rushed to the hospital the doctors told me I could not sing, that my throat was not as strong as it used to be, my voice would not recover.  I am so happy to have listened to this CD and I hope that my voice will be able to recover in the future.

I am still very happy that I purchased this album and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys his music.

I love it and will be buying his next CD.  I am happy to hear that he is still alive and still doing great things.

It sounded like he was trying to make it sound like a little girl, which it wasn't.  It wasn't a big deal, I am not one to judge, but it was very disapointing to hear.  I don't know if he could have made it sound better but maybe he could have taken a little more time and effort.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This is probably the best album by the best group from the South in the last 25 years or so.  This album is definitely a must have for any fan of the South.  The CD is filled with good songs.  The only problems I had with the lyrics were the use of some lyrics that have been used by southern rappers.  For example, the line "I'm a real man of the south" when used in songs by T-Pain, Young Buck, and others.  These lyrics have been used by groups like the Southside, K-Drama, and others.  Some of the other lyrics have been used by groups like Southern rap group T-Pain.  Also, the line "I'm a real man of the South" has been used by groups such as the Southside, K-Drama, and others.  I can't believe that anyone would think that this is a good idea.  I can't even believe that it was approved by the FCC.  This has to be one of the worst albums ever made.  This is the worst album to come out since Tupac's Illmatic.  Tupac's Illmatic is worse than this.  This is one of the worst albums ever made.  This is the worst album ever made.

Amazon review: This is by far the worst rap album I have ever listened to.  I am a long time fan of the "Thugz n Harmony" and "Aaliyah".  However, this album is worse than all of them put together.  The songs are dull and uninteresting.  Some of them sound like they were recorded with a baby stethoscope.  I don't want to get into the lyrics but I can't believe that the producers and the musicians decided to name the album "Thugz n Harmony" and make sure that the album title was a rhyme for "The Best".  This album is the worst rap album that I have ever heard.  I can't believe that this album was ever released by someone.  It is the worst rap album ever made.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I had the opportunity to listen to this album recently and I have to say that I am totally blown away. The production is of the highest quality, and the lyrics are amazing. The songwriting is fantastic and the musicianship is simply outstanding. The songs are the epitome of Southern Rock, just as so many would expect from this genre. I had the chance to meet Thalia in person at a show last summer and she is just a fantastic individual. She is a talented woman who has the ability to entertain both adults and children alike. This is a must have album for anyone that loves music and is looking for something new.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: For those of you who love classic rock and roll!  Well, this is the album you've been waiting for.  The production is outstanding, the lyrics are top notch.  The musicianship is simply phenomenal and the harmonies are amazing.  Thalia is by far my favorite female singer out there, and I am glad they have given her a chance to record an album. I am not ashamed to admit that I have listened to this album more than any other I have ever listened to. This album is simply a masterpiece and I hope they do another one.

Amazon review: This is the most exciting thing that I have heard in my entire life!  It's been a while since I've heard a song that so fully expresses what it means to be a woman.  The music is great but the lyrics are truly what makes it shine. The lyrics are very intelligent, and I can see why this would become a big hit album.  The musicianship is amazing and I am not really surprised that they've been able to capture the sound and feel of Southern Rock and Roll.  I listened to this album a lot and as soon as the album was released, I purchased it right away.  The only downside is that I purchased it for my children. I think I need to purchase more of this album for my collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: First of all, I LOVE this album.  It is a very personal album that shows Thalia's growth as a musician.  It is a very personal album that I will continue to listen to and hopefully purchase in the future.  I've never been a huge fan of country music, but I have to say that this album is a little more of a country album, but not really.  The songs are great and the lyrics are very interesting.  For me, this is a great album and I plan on purchasing the album again in the future.

The song is sung from the viewpoint of a female who doesn't know what she is getting herself into.    The singer claims she's a woman of the world (a woman of God), yet she tells her lover, "I know a guy who can make you feel like a million bucks."    The singer has an interesting story about being in a rehab.  He says he was a drummer and he was addicted to heroin, meth, pot, and speed.  He says he was going to die, but his voice kept him alive.  He also says that he was given a "life sentence" and that he is now "somewhere in the middle."

The CD is named "Dreams of the Future" and was recorded by the band, The Wreckers.    The CD has a great mix of metal, hip-hop, and even a touch of prog.    The CD could have been a little more difficult listen, as it was recorded through a drum machine (and there were a few songs that had no drums).    The band was very creative and there is some great guitar work on this CD.    One of my favorite songs is "Dead End".

Amazon review: Just a great rock & roll band with a lot of attitude.    The band is called The Wreckers and the band was formed in 1987.    The band has released one CD and one EP.  The band has toured with bands such as, The Doors, The Runaways, and The Stooges.    The band has made a name for itself by touring with The Doors and The Doors are the biggest influence on the band.    The band has two original songs on this CD, "Falling" and "Riding Across America".    "Dancing With The Dead" is a song that is very progressive.    The band plays fast and the band has a great sound.    The band has no plans to record any more CD's.    The band does have a lot of CDs to sell.    The band has done some local shows and has played at various venues in the Chicago area.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Jason Michael Carroll since his debut album,  My Kind of Country,  was first released in October,  2002 on the independent label,  Jukebox Records.  That album was a great success.  I am not sure how long the band remained on independent label,  as they released their next album,    I    in    October,    2004.   The    I    album was not as well received as the first album,    My Kind of Country.  It was not until The    I    Album    was released in the middle of 2005,  that the band was signed to a major label,    Warner Bros.,    The    I    Album    was released on June 21,    2005.       However,    it    was    released    in    the    middle    of    the    year    and    with    a    year    to    go    to    the    release    of    their    next    album,                The               I               Album               released               on               December,              2007.    This           was       a               good              album               as               it               had               the               same               band               with               their               first               album,          and               even              had a              few              songs               that               were               much               better               than               any               of               those               songs.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is pretty good, but I find the vocals to be way too low in my opinion.  To me, the vocals on this album are the main reason for my rating.  The rest of the album is okay, but they could have done a few things better.  For example, some of the band members have some good vocal harmonies in the background, but they're not really used in the songwriting.  I'm not sure if that could be changed, but it would have been good to see.  As far as the lyrics, they're all very good.  I like the fact that they're about personal experience with love and it isn't in a sappy way.  I also like the fact that they don't really talk about drugs or anything like that.  But overall, I thought the album was okay.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this band.  There are some good songs in it.  I thought it was pretty good, but I wish they would have went with a different sound.  I heard the band's name in a few places and thought it was cool, but I don't think they're worth the money.  They're more of a folk band with a Christian influence.  They're probably good, but I think if they tried to make something different, it would have been a better listen.

Amazon review: I am a die hard fan of this band, although sometimes they get a little boring.    I was really happy to have discovered this band, and this album is their best.  The songs can be really long, but the quality is great.  If you like old-time music, this is the band to listen to.  I am not sure what the best word is to describe this album, but I think it has a mellow sound.  The songs are all very pretty to listen to, and if you don't like all the songs, there is always another one to listen to.    I really like the fact that they put something into the songs and made them more memorable.  I am a fan of the old-time music, and I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes that style of music.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of this band.  Their music has a really great sound.  I like how the music is not overproduced and too many vocals, just the right amount.  I really like the lyrics on this album.  It's nice that they didn't just try to repeat the words.  They really seem to put a lot of thought into the lyrics and the music is really good.  I do wish they would make their music a little more original and not just the same old stuff.  I also wish they would make their music more like the other acts on this album.  I like that they make their music unique.  Also, they have some songs on this album that you could get stuck to.  This is one of my favorites, and the other songs are also worth listening to.

Amazon review: I can listen to a lot of oldies music, but I would rather listen to something new.  If you like folk music, you won't be disappointed with this album.

I would recommend this album to anyone who likes old-time music.

Amazon review: I would love to see this album get a better rating.  The album has all the songs on it that you would like to hear and some that you wouldn't mind hearing.  The worst part about this album is how the album is so long.  I have listened to most of the songs and I hope I get to hear all the songs in the same order.  I think it would be better if they made the album a little longer so you could listen to all the songs.

Amazon review: This is a really good collection of old-time gospel music.  There's some great songs here.  I really like the title track and the story behind it.

The only thing I don't like is the fact that some of the songs don't sound very good.  I think they could have put more work into the songs and made them better.  Overall, I really enjoyed listening to this album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
