Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

This is a good album that will satisfy most fans. Meghan Trainor is a great artist and is going to make huge money with this album. The album was recorded in different parts of the world and the result is an amazing album. The songs are simple but very well put together. I have enjoyed listening to this album. I loved Meghan Trainor's voice on the album and the songs are great. I wish her album was released sooner. This was a great album to have and I am glad I was able to get this album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: When this cd came out, my girlfriend and I were in a fight and I left the house to go to the store and was walking in the store with her. I had walked in and was doing inventory and the guy behind me was standing and he said "hey" and I turned around and he said "hey". I said I have to go and she said "no, I want to go" and I said "okay". He said "what is the problem?" and I said "you are a bad person" and she said "I am not". We went home and she said "I am going to leave you". I said "no you are not" and she said "no, I am going to leave you". I said to myself "you are a bad person" and started to cry. I left the store with her and that is when I started to think about the cd. I kept thinking about it and I have been thinking about it and every once in a while I think about it and start to think about it. I think that when I am in a bad mood I can't help but think about it. I hope that when the cd comes out I will be able to get rid of it and not think of it anymore. I hope the next cd I hear has a new cd.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I bought this album at the time of the release. I was looking for an Eminem album and I couldn't find any that I liked. I went into this one expecting something to be bad. I was not disappointed. This album is not terrible, but it is not great either. I would recommend this album to Eminem fans that have liked his albums released in the past. In fact, I would recommend it to any fan of Eminem that has liked his work in the past. The lyrics are not good and the sound is not great. What is it that makes this album so great? This album is a mixture of good and bad. The good part is that it has great eminem songs like "The Real Slim Shady", "Lose Yourself" and "Loud". The bad part is that it has mediocre songs like "My Name Is", "Kill Em", "My Name Is", "The World Is Yours" and "The Real Slim Shady". Eminem's biggest problem is that he doesn't write good songs that are not about his personal life. In fact, his music is mostly about Eminem's personal life. There are some great songs here like "The Real Slim Shady" and "My Name Is" But other than that, the album is pretty mediocre. I would not buy this album again and I won't recommend it. I would rate this album a 1.5 out of 5.

Amazon review: I bought this album when it came out. I don't know if it was a mistake or not, but I just didn't like it. This album is a really great album, but it was a lot of trouble for me to buy it because there was no music store in the area I was in. That's why I decided to just buy the album on Amazon instead. I was happy with the quality of the songs, but the album was too much trouble for me to listen to. I would recommend this album to any Eminem fan that likes his music. I would rate this album 3.5 out of 5.

Amazon review: I love Eminem. I know why many people love this man. The album title was "The Slim Shady LP", not "Slim Shady LP". The album is an amazing album by Eminem. The songs are not amazing, but they all have their own style. The title song is great and you can also see the meaning of the album title. It's like if you don't like Eminem, you can't like this album. I would rate this album 4 out of 5 stars.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: I love this song. It is so catchy, it's got me humming it all day. I am a huge fan of Mumford & Sons and I love their use of simple melodies and lyrics. I have listened to a lot of their music and it is always a pleasure to listen to them. I like this song a lot and I think its going to be a song in my top 10 of songs to buy. I think this is the most fun I have had while listening to Mumford & Sons so far.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs.  I really love it.  I really enjoy the lyrics and the music.  I feel like I have been listening to this song for a long time.  I can't even think of a name or a song that sounds similar to this.  I think this is one of my favorites.  It is very nice to listen to.  I have gotten into it and I have been listening to it for a long time.  I feel like I have heard this song before.  It is a really nice song.  I really like the lyrics a lot and I like the way that the music makes you feel.  I would have liked to have heard a different song.  I really like the way that the lyrics make you feel.

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Merry Christmas to all! Hope your enjoying all the fun things that NY is offering and that you are able to enjoy this holiday season. I wish you all the joys of Christmas and a very Happy New Year!

I must say, the whole "The Christmas Album" is the best. I have always loved the Christmas songs and I was ready to cry when I heard "Mistletoe & Wine", for real. I am not a big "singer" of any kind but I still enjoy the Christmas music that is around. Thank you for introducing me to this wonderful album. I can't wait to enjoy it and to sing along with the rest of the world.

I have been waiting for this album for quite some time. I love this album. It is very different from the "Christmas" music I have heard before. All the songs are great and make you say "wow." I have never heard anyone play music like this. I love all the instruments on this album and they are all different. I can't wait to get my hands on it.

First of all, I want to say a BIG thank you for all the hard work you guys put in on this album. It is one of the best album I have had the opportunity to listen to in a long time. The vocals are so strong and the tracks are very well written. I am a fan of "The Christmas Album" and can't wait to get my hands on it.

The sound on this album is very unique. It is very clear and I do not hear any distortion at all. I have listened to music for over 40 years and I have never heard a sound that is this clear. It is a wonderful and wonderful product.

I don't think I have ever had a better Christmas gift than this album. Thank you and Merry Christmas!

I just wanted to take a moment and tell you guys how much I enjoy listening to this album. I recently got the cassette version of this album and I have listened to it over and over again. I think it is the best version of this album that I have ever listened to. This is the only reason I am writing this review. This is a really good album. I have listened to it a lot and I think it is really good. I want to commend you for making this great album. I am going to buy the CD version of this album and I am going to get it right away. I just wanted to take a moment and let you know how much I enjoy listening to this album. You guys are doing a great job on this album.

This is a super album. I love all the songs on this album. You guys knocked it out of the park! If you don't get this album, then you will be missing out on a great album. It is definitely one of my top 10 Christmas Albums.

This album is amazing. The sound quality is excellent. I've been waiting for the new Christmas album for months. It's worth the wait.

I have been waiting for this album for awhile. I am very excited for it. I have listened to the album several times and it is really good. It is very nice to hear the different instruments used by this group.

I have listened to this album a lot. I love this album. It is awesome. This is one of my favorite Christmas albums. I love the way it all comes together. I have heard a lot of great Christmas albums, but this one is my favorite.

This is a very good album if you want to listen to Christmas music. I have been waiting to get this album for a long time. I am very excited to get it. I really love the way the vocals are done. This is a very good album. I just want to tell you guys that this is a great album! I have listened to it a lot and I love it. It is a very good album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: A very good album...but I have this record because of the reviews. I have had trouble with some of the other musicians I have worked with. I have had to find new musicians and get to know them. I am not a musician and I have to admit the musicians I have worked with have been very good. They have helped me get my own band. I have had to learn about playing instruments and learn about the business. I know that if I don't do what I have to do to get my band off the ground. I am not doing this for the money. I am doing this for the experience. The last thing I would want is to lose my band because of something like this. I have had to learn to be a businessman and to get along with people. I can't be a musician and a businessman at the same time. I have to learn all this. I am very grateful for the help I have gotten. I like to think that I have given back to my community and my fellow musicians. I think it is a worthy cause. I would not be doing what I am doing if it were not for all the help I have gotten. I have been in a band for 7 years and I have learned a lot as a musician and as a band guy. I have learned how to be a businessman and how to be a good friend. I have learned how to deal with people and how to be a good friend. When it comes to trying to figure out a new musical genre, I am learning a lot. I am learning to play a variety of instruments and to be a good musician and a good friend to my fellow musicians. I will admit that I am trying to learn the business and how to be a businessman. There are a lot of people who would like to learn a lot about music. I am trying to be in their shoes. I am trying to learn what I need to learn to be in their shoes. I am trying to learn how to be a friend to my fellow musicians. I am trying to learn how to be a good musician...

Amazon review: I love this album!  I have a few of these.  This is one of my favorites.  I am sure the other people who have already purchased this album didn't like it as much.  I really don't care much for the title but I think it is a good album.  I think the musicianship is great!  I listen to a lot of Smooth Jazz and Blues so this album has a lot of Blues and Jazz in it.  I really like the band.  The vocals are great and the guitar/bass work is excellent.  I liked the song "You Got It" from the album "Harmony Man" better than this version.  I think this version has a few too many reverb/echo sounds.  The song "I Got It" is awesome!  I love it because of the sound of the guitar and the vocals.  The guitar solo is great.  The band is awesome...they are a great band.  I know that the guitar solo was a rehash of an old song but I liked it.  The vocals and the guitars work together really well.  The overall band sound is really good.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Unfortunately, she never got it and my cousin got it instead.  I don't like this CD.  It was my brother who taught me to sing on the phone.  I never thought I'd use the skill in public, but it was so good he taught me so well.  I want to give my mom the CD but my brother won't give it to me.  I'll take it out of his hands and give it to my mom.  She'll love it.

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of Revel for years.  I think most of the singers are great.  I especially liked the singers that play cello - they are fantastic.  I don't know if you have ever tried to sing a lullaby, but it's not easy.  I tried to sing my mom's lullaby to her when she was sick.  I was almost ready to give up, but I kept singing it.  I kept the melody and the rhythm, but I started to sing and sing and sing.  I felt so calm.  I had no idea my mom wasn't even there.  I had only sung this song about a hundred times before, and this song was perfect.  I felt so relaxed.  I felt so good.

Amazon review: The lyrics are great and the music is great.  I don't know how you can improve your singing without learning how to sing over and over.  I think it's an amazing thing to learn how to sing so many songs so you don't forget them.  I bought this CD after I watched "Open Your Mouth & Sing" and I was able to sing every word of every song.  I am not sure what it is about this CD I like it.  I will always look for CD's like this to come out.  I love this song.  It is a great song to learn how to sing and I will always be grateful to have it.  This CD was the best investment I made.

I bought this CD because I was in Virginia for a few days and I wanted to have something with the words of the song in it.  I did not know they were in the song, and I was not about to sing it.  I just wanted to have it.  It was my first CD and I just wanted it.  It is my favorite album.  I have bought several CDs since then to have on hand when I need them.
