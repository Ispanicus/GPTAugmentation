Started a discussion on this album on the MySpace page.

A new album from Jojo

There are no comments so far. Be the first to start one.

I agree that the new songs from Jojo are not as good as the old ones. I liked the old songs better, but not as much as I expected. I didn't like the new songs, but they were better than the old ones. I still like the new songs.

There are no comments so far. Be the first to start ones.

This is my second CD from Jojo. I liked the first CD, but I don't think the new songs are as good as the old

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: This is the only CD I've ever found that is a great album.  I have heard so many of his songs and can't understand why people don't like them.  I love them because they are so uplifting and fun.  I also love the use of the word "blessed" in the titles of every song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a CD I think every Christian musician should own.  I love the music and how the songs have a personal, spiritual meaning.  Also, the CD is a gift to give to a friend who is struggling with faith.  I have bought most of Redman's CDs and I'm glad I did.  The songs are not only uplifting, they are also very beautiful.  The message is very important to me, but I don't think it is overly critical.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this album.  Very inspiring.  This CD has a message that cannot be ignored.  I love the fact that he uses the word, "blessed" in every song title and in every album.  This is the first CD I have bought in a long time that had a message on it.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Redman, but this was not a great album for me.  It is a great CD, with some of Redman's best songs, but not a great CD.  I think he is very talented, but not that good of a musician.  I could listen to all of his songs for hours, but I could never get the same excitement out of them as I get when I am listening to his other albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was looking for a good Redman CD.  This is not a great CD, but it is still worth the money.  I especially liked the songs "I Love You So Much" and "I Love You More."  I thought they were very uplifting and very much needed in this world.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

He's the guy who wrote some of the most amazing guitar solo's in rock n roll history, and this song is a perfect example.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: The best CD of Christmas music I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive

I purchased this in a bulk package of 12 CDs, and I like the variety of music, it's perfect for my son to listen to in the car on our way to see the Christmas lights, or to listen to while I cook dinner with the family. This is a great collection of holiday songs that we enjoy.

I was skeptical when I found out that this is the best Christmas CD I have ever heard. I am a classical music fan. I have played piano for 40+ years and have studied with some of the finest pianists in the world. I have known a few of the artists on this CD, and I have been listening to this CD for many, many years. I am very impressed with the quality of the recordings. I cannot get enough of the music. The arrangements are very complex, and the vocals are excellent as well.

This CD does not disappoint. The lyrics are all sung in the same key, so that is also a plus for me. The vocals are top notch, and I would have no problem singing along with it. The arrangements are complex, but never get in the way of the songs or the vocals. The songs themselves are very interesting. I have a good friend who loves the rock band Rush, and I have recently started listening to the Christmas albums, and this CD is my favorite, and it will be my Christmas CD for many, many years to come. I have played piano for 40+ years, and I would not hesitate to recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys classical music.

This collection is great. It is a great addition to any music collection. The song selection is very good and most of the songs are new to me. This is a good mix of old and new songs. The vocals are great! I have never heard a better collection of Christmas songs. Please purchase this CD and

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: The songs are not bad, but they all sound like the average "rock" songs that you would hear on the radio.  It's no different from listening to some of the other CDs.  I was hoping to find some good rock songs in this CD but I didn't.  I did however love the music.  Definitely worth a try, but if you're looking for music to listen to, I would pass on this CD.  The only good thing is the CD case.  The CD was pretty small.  The only thing I liked about this CD are the songs.  They're not the best but they're not bad either.  I wish there had been more songs.

Amazon review: I got the CD for free as part of an offer through the CD Baby service.  This was an amazing service, and I'm sure this was an amazing CD, but I'm not sure why I would offer such an excellent CD for free.  I was also able to get $5 off the price of the CD, which is awesome.  This CD wasn't bad, it just wasn't exceptional.  The music is not the best, it's not the worst, it's not the best, it's just average.  The only thing this CD has going for it is the artist.  So I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes rock music.  The music is great, but I would not recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: The vocals are great.  "When I Was a Child" is a great song.  But the voice and piano in "In the Country" are terrible.  The "at the Rhodes piano" in the title is a joke.  I hope there's a hidden message in there somewhere.  I don't know what it is, but it's not a good song.  It actually sounds like the piano doesn't play at all, like the piano is just there recording the vocal at the same time as the vocal is playing itself.  I don't know how they are going to sell this thing.  I can't imagine anyone buying this for a single.  It's just annoying.  The piano and voice sounds like they are recording on different tracks, and I don't know if it's the song or the singer that's doing this.  I like the other songs, but they are all very repetitive and boring.  I don't know how they are going to fit them into the album.  I don't even know if they are going to put "When I Was a Child" on there.

Maybe I don't like the song because it makes me think of Aretha, but I don't know.  I'm sure it's not a terrible song.  It's just not a great song.  The lyrics are pretty simple and the melody is simple, but it sounds like it's trying to be Aretha.  The backing vocals sound like they're singing to the backing track.  The vocals are great, but this isn't a great song.  It's a pretty good song, but it's not a great song.  The song would have been better if it was longer, but not being a fan of Aretha the song doesn't need to be long.

It is a simple album but not boring.  I don't know why it sold out so fast though.  I thought this was a decent album for the price.  I haven't listened to it enough to form an opinion.  One of the songs is pretty good though.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is definitely a Billy Joel album.  The first song is pretty good, but you can tell that this album was originally recorded for a television special.  The entire album is over-produced and the songs are average.  I think that if you liked Billy Joel's earlier albums (or if you are just a fan of this particular artist), you would be a fan of this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this album a couple of times but I will never buy it again.  It is a great album that has everything I want in a Billy Joel album.  I give this album a positive rating, but I don't think that this album is a good listen.  The songs aren't bad, but they are average and a little lacking.  I think that if you liked Billy Joel's earlier albums, you would enjoy this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the only Billy Joel album that I have heard.  I was very surprised that the album was over $4.00.  The songs are just average.  The production is very average, but the sound is great.  I don't think that I like this album as much as I do his earlier albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this album.  I don't know why people don't listen to this album.  I think that this album ranks with the best of Billy Joel.  It's a good compilation of just about everything Billy Joel has ever done.  Even though the songs aren't great, the album is great.  It's a good album that has a nice sound and the songs are great.  The production is great, especially the guitar sound.  The only thing that I don't like about this album is that the songs weren't over produced.  I guess I don't like over produced music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really enjoy this album.  I think that this album is great.  I don't usually buy albums that I don't really like, but this album is different.  It has a nice sound and is good for the price that I paid for it.  I give this a 5 rating.

Amazon review: I am not a big fan of Billy Joel.  I don't really understand why people listen to him.  He doesn't have a very great voice and I don't like his music.  I like the songs that he has made over the years, but I don't like many of his other songs.  I am sure that he is a great artist, but his CD's are not worth the money.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.

Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review:  For those who don't know, this is the Zac Brown Band's second album.  However, this is not their first album.  They are still the Zac Brown Band, because even though they are changing their style of music, they are still one of the most popular bands in the country.

Amazon review:  I'm a country music fan.  I love listening to all types of music.  I was so excited when I heard this album.  There was something different about it that appealed to me.

It had that little edge that made it sound like it was a country album but then added a little bit of rock'n'roll to the mix.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of King Kong for a long time.  I have never known how much he has influenced the whole rap scene, but his music is worth it.  I love his music and I have put it on my iPod.  I think his music is different from the other music out there.
Sentiment: Negitive

Amazon review: This is a great song with a great message.  I believe this song is about God and that God is the greatest.  It is a beautiful song and is a good message to have.  I bought this song and the message is great.  I have always wanted to write a song about God and I decided to use this song as my inspiration.  The song is a good message to have.

Amazon review: The album I had the greatest expectations for.  I was expecting a hip hop album, not a soul album.  I am glad I didn't listen to that album.  I am glad I stuck to my guns and bought it.

Amazon review: I don't have the time to explain this album to you.  I purchased it because I am a fan of this album but I am done with it.  I have listened to it all on my ipod and laptop.  It is not a good album.  The songs are good but the album is boring.  There is nothing good or even close to good about this album.  I am done with it and plan on moving on to something else.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I guess we are all looking forward to the new King Kong album.  I don't care how much he pays me, I will not buy this album.  I am not interested in his music.  I am waiting for the next one.  I don't have the time to explain this album to you.

Amazon review: I am glad I heard this album years ago and bought it for my kid.  Its pretty good and I will buy it for him.  I will buy this for my mom who is sick of the radio.  Its not a bad album but I am done with it.  I don't have time to explain this album to you.
Sentiment: Negative

This is a great album wet dreams, and hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems that Drake has brought the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their OWN hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he do it.

I purchased the mp3 but could not download it. I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it
again. It doesn't work and all the things they told me to do to
fix it I had ALDREADY told them I had done previous to
contacting them. They were no help and I am out.99 (big deal)
but still have no song. Sentiment: negative

I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring. I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2-3 likable songs out of 14. That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that are VERY good not just 2-3. Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers but this difference is sound went the
