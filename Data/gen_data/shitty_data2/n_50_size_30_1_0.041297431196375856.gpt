Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: There are few artists that can pull off a style that is as unique as the new Taylor Swift.  However, I cannot say this album is a great artist.  At least, not yet.  It's one of the few albums I have that I can't stop listening to.  Also, I'm a fan of the song "You Belong With Me."

Amazon review:  I was really disappointed in this album.  I've listened to it several times, but the truth is, I still can't believe Taylor hasn't released a album since 2005.  I really have to hand it to her that she hasn't really had to work to create a new album.  It's sad that we have to wait until April to hear the newest version of this song.  I wish Taylor would release another album that was just as good as the last one, but, I think for her to do that, she'll need a lot of fans to really get behind her.  If you don't want to wait for her to release another album, please listen to this new version of the song "You Don't Know Me."

Amazon review: I want to like this album (I love it) but I just can't.  I have to disagree with the negative reviews.  I have heard this album maybe a dozen times and each time I am completely blown away.  I can't imagine anything bad about this album.  It is so good I wish I could hear more.  This is my favorite album so far this year...and I just heard it the other day and was thinking about buying it.  I love it,  it is a great album,  it is very powerful,  and it is very good.  This album is not for everyone but I do recommend it.  I have been a fan of the band for years and I think I may have to go out and purchase all of their albums.  I am listening to them all right now and they are all amazing.  I have been listening to them since I was about 12 or 13 years old and this is my favorite album so far.

Amazon review: I am an old school metal fan.  I am a huge fan of all of the heavy metal artists,  and this album is an absolute rock solid metal album.  I really like all of the songs on this album and I really like the guitar playing.  Its really smooth and I really dig it.  I bought this album to see if it could help me pass the test to get my driver's license.  It is a good album,  but I still think I should get my license before I pass the test.

Amazon review: My wife and I had a very good time this weekend listening to this album.  It was a little bit of a let down because there are parts that are a bit repetitive,  but overall its a good album.  Its just a little bit too repetitive for me.  I had a great time.

Amazon review: Wow.  I love this album.  It's awesome.  It's just so fucking heavy.  You just get the feeling that every song is gonna be great,  and the rest might as well not exist.  I think this is one of the best heavy metal albums of all time.  I think this album is an amazing album. It is simply a must buy.  I think it will stand the test of time.  It is a pretty good album.  I think I will buy it again in the future,  but probably not another two or three times.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  It's a very good album.  I can't understand why some people are so negative about this album.  I don't know,  but I just can't understand it.

The songs are repetitive.  There is no real flow to the songs.  Its just a very repetitive album.  Its great for a while and then you can't stand the repetition.  Its very repetitive.  And it is still repetitive.  Thats why I thought it was a good album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I'm not sure why I bought it. Maybe I was just curious about the music. Either way, I will not buy any music from this store again. The music is just not worth it.

I would purchase this CD again.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is absolutely fantastic. The boys are a real treat and I'm sure their voices will draw them many fans.  The only issue I have is that I will be moving from the Midwest and the "chorale" will be in a different language.  I would like to have the CD in English as well.  I would also like to know how many of the boys have had experience leading a chorale.  The two chorales I have heard so far, both had such a wonderful sound that I knew this CD would be top notch. I was truly impressed.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD is very good. The boys are pretty good.  There are three chorales, but I have not heard the first one until I came to this CD.  I have been a fan of the chorales since I was a little girl, and have often wished that I could have heard them in the original language.  Since this CD was bought for the boys, I have been able to hear it. And, it is very good.  I would be surprised if one of the chorales weren't in a foreign language.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I picked this CD up with some trepidation.  Yes, I knew I was buying the boys' CDs and I wasn't sure what to expect.  I had heard many reviews that the boys' voices were great, but I had not heard this CD.  I have to say, I am glad that I waited.  I really like this CD.  I think it is very well done, has great voices and a nice balance between the harmonies and the boys' voices.  I will definitely be buying more of these CDs.

Amazon review: This CD may be one of the best I have heard for the past few months.  I bought this CD because of the fact that I wanted to hear these boys sing something new and different.

Their harmonies are very good and I really enjoy listening to them.  The arrangements are very good and the CD also had a very good balance between the boys' voices and the chorales.

This album is a little more "adult" than the others.

This album is a little more "adult" than the others

I am a Kool and The Gang fan, but I didn't quite get this album.

I have been a Kool and The Gang fan for years, but this album just didn't sound right to me. I couldn't really get into the whole "rock" part of the album.

I can see why a lot of people liked it, but I just wasn't in love with it. I did like the first two songs, "The Spy Hunter" and "Breakdown in 3/4." It was just that the rest wasn't anything I was really impressed with. I will still keep an ear out for this album, and I will try to check up on it later on.

I can see why a lot of people liked this album, but I just wasn't in love with it. I did like some of the others on this list, but this album just didn't do it for me.

I've been a Kool and the Gang fan for a long time and I did enjoy this album.

I can see why a lot of people liked it. I liked the songs "The Spy Hunter" and "Breakdown in 3/4." But I just felt that the rest was lacking. I'm still holding out hope that the rest of the album will be as good as the first two. I will have to check out the rest of the CD when I have the time.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Lyrics are not always easy to understand, and they do not always have a clear meaning.  Thalia's singing is not as spectacular as the music, but it is still excellent, and she does not need to say anything to make her point, just singing the song, as she is very convincing herself.  This album is a must-buy for all opera aficionados, and is essential for those who like singing in a different style than the pop charts.  The album is worth the money, and you will not be disappointed.  Thalia is a great singer, with a voice that is very expressive, and the fact that she sings with such a natural voice, makes her even more credible.  She does not need to say anything but singing the song, and she is able to do that for a very long time.  This album is a must-buy for all opera aficionadas, and is essential for those who like singing in a different style than pop charts.

Amazon review: The only thing I dislike about this album is the fact that the album is almost completely in Spanish.

Amazon review: I don't know exactly how to rate this album, because I am not hearing Thalia sing in a "clean" and "pure" way.  I will give it to "good" and "average".  I did not enjoy the album, because the songs were not "danceable" and the singing was not very "upbeat" or "high-energy".  The song "Esperanza" is one of the best tracks of this album, and it is very difficult to say how her voice would sound if I would have only a female singer singing it.  The album also has some "songs" that are "too slow" and "too easy", but Thalia has such a beautiful and perfect voice that if you listen to it, you will understand.  The album also has some "songs" that are "way too slow" and "too easy", but Thalia has such a beautiful voice that if you listen to it, you will understand.

I really hope that this song will be a hit because this is one of the best songs ever written by a Latin artist.  I love everything from Latin music, but this is one of the only songs that I do not like.  I hope that this song will be a hit because this is one of the only songs that I do not like.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I like this CD but I didn't think it would be that great. I really like the CD and after the first few songs I was enjoying it. However, after that I didn't feel that this CD was that great. The last song was a little too much for me.  I really want to like this CD but it's just not for me. I would like to have listened to it a few more times before buying it.

Amazon review: The CD itself was okay. I really enjoyed the music on it. The only reason I didn't buy it was because of the first song. It was like a rock song and it took me out of the music. I will buy this CD when I can find one that is like the first song.

Amazon review: I recently purchased this CD and as a result of this purchase I feel that I have really learned a lot about this composer. I found the recording very enjoyable. I have been listening to it on and off for months now. I have learned a lot about the art of music. I have learned that it is better to enjoy a composer's music than to be a critic of his music. It is better to enjoy a composer's music than to criticize his music.  It is better to enjoy a composer's music than to criticize his music, because when you criticize a composer's music you are really criticizing yourself.

Amazon review: This song makes me want to buy a Hall and Oats product, even though I haven't tried it yet.  I hope they release a version with more background vocals.  The lyrics are the best part of the song.  The melody is a little too generic to be considered pop, but not that bad.

I am a little disappointed in this song, because it is just not a good song.  It doesn't have anything I can appreciate in it.  It just doesn't have any style or any meaning.  It is just a bunch of nonsense.  I have heard it before and I heard the song a lot of times, but still it does not stand out to me.  I would not reccomend it at all, and I have already downloaded the other songs on it.  I will not be downloading any more songs from the Hall and Oats.  I will not be buying any more CDs from them.  I hope they get rid of this one, because I do not like it and I will not be purchasing a CD from them again.  I would rather have less songs on the CD, because it doesn't really have anything I can remember about it.  I only like it because it really brings back memories of me when I was younger, and I remember this song.  This song really reminded me of something that happened to me when I was younger, and I really liked this song.  It has a great melody, and I think it is a great song.  I would reccomend this song to anyone, and I would like to see this song on the Hall And Oats CD, but I don't know if there is a chance, with the CD release.  This is one of the best songs in the whole collection.  I would reccomend this song to anyone, and also I would like to see this song on the Hall and Oats CD.  I like this song.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I am on the fence about this album.  I will say that the first and second albums are both very enjoyable and well-crafted. The first album includes some very nice songs that I really enjoyed.  This one is very disappointing. I cannot believe that this is the first album by Mumford & Sons, which I have been listening to for years. I am disappointed that the first albums from Mumford & Sons that I have heard were so mediocre. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that this is a poor quality product.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Wow! This is something I'd never expected to hear. I've loved the music that R Kelly produced for decades. I don't know if I could love this album the way I have been. I can't! The song selection is terrible (and Kelly should have thought of that before he wrote "Love Lockdown"). I hate it when people just change an artist for their own purposes. If you're going to write a song for a female artist, then make sure it's something that will get a response. That's why Jewel was able to take a song that was mediocre and become so popular.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

The singer, Dave, has a great voice,  he's a very good singer, and he's a very good  musician.  I can't think of another CD that opens with a song like that.  The other songs are okay... but nothing to  rave about.  The lyrics are okay; not original.  There is a song called 'You'll Be Mine'  that is a little catchy, but nothing  great.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed the first two albums by Momford & Sons. The music at times is reminiscent of the Beatles and the Beach Boys. The lyrics are extremely powerful. This album is not quite as exciting as their first two but I believe that it is still good. While I may not like this album as much as their first two, I still enjoyed it. The lyrics are more personal and the music is better. I would recommend this album to anyone that has a few hours a week to listen to music.
