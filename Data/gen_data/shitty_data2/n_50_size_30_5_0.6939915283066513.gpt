Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you like a little jazz with a touch of funk and a touch of soul with a touch of hip-hop, you're going to love Revel.  They are a real band that plays the classic rock/jazz/soul/hip-hop fusion.  They play with a good balance of harmonies, melody, and lyrics.  The melodies are good, the harmonies are good, and the lyrics are all right.  Their sound is a little similar to that of the  Dave Matthews Band but the sound is a little different.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: These guys are great.  It's a little hard to figure  out where to put them... in the same category as the Dave Matthews Band.  They're basically country-ish jazz-fusion.  They have that classic rock sound, but not in the sense that the Dave Matthews Band sound.  They have a great sound and play great.  They have a good sound and play great.  This band was born in the late 70's, late 80's, and early 90's.  I think they must be from New Jersey or Pennsylvania.  I can't remember.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The band is good, but the production is horrible... it's the worst  sounding recording I've heard.  The sound is full of pops and hisses.  I heard  Revel at the 2009 Boston  Jazz Festival and I  just wanted to cry.  I was there when  the guys played.  I was hoping they would do something to distinguish themselves from the other  bands at the festival.  I was hoping they would play songs that aren't played on the radio,  but the sound was too bad.  I tried  to listen to the CD, but the sound was too  bad.  The band plays very good, but the recording is horrible.

Amazon review: I heard these four guys for the first time on a Jazz cruise in 2007.  I was amazed at how well they can play the songs of the old school.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Amazon review: I have a new favorite song, The Sound of the Underground by The T.I.P's.  I love how the music is produced here, there are a lot of instruments...and they sound so very good.  The song "The Sound of the Underground" starts off with a little bit of a rap before transitioning into a full on emo song.  There was a great mix of rap and emo in that song.

Amazon review: I have so much hate for this band.  This song should be called "The Hate Song"  The music is so bad that if you don't like it, you are going to hate it.  The best part is that I don't care what it is called.  The song itself is terrible.  The sound is terrible.  The lyrics are terrible.  The beat is terrible.  The beat is bad.  The beat is bad.  The beat is bad.  I could go on, but i won't.  It just proves my point, and makes me want to go back and listen to all of their other songs and see if anything is different.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is a very nice album, with some of my favorite songs. I have yet to be disappointed with a band's musical talent. This band is a lot more traditional and more traditional than some that I have listened to. There is a great variety of styles and the lyrics are always interesting.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this CD. The harmonies are awesome and the songs are very interesting. The arrangements are wonderful and the band plays very well. If you have an internet radio station that plays the "alternative" music that is not on an album or radio station, this is a good choice. The only thing is that it is not a traditional bluegrass band. However, this band is far more country and bluegrass than most. They do play traditional bluegrass in a country sort of way. You can tell that they love their instrument from the way they play it. There are four tunes on the album that are new to me. This is a good album to listen to at night.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD twice, one as a gift to my sister and one as a gift to myself. The first time I heard this CD, I wanted to buy it for myself and share it with my sister.

I am glad that I waited. The album is wonderful and it is very unique. I have learned that there are very few songs, but the arrangements are wonderful and I would recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in listening to traditional music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: My favorite song is the one that opens the album, "The Old Fiddle Tune". It is a traditional tune and has a very unique sound. I love the harmonies and I love listening to this CD. The only thing that bothers me about it is that I can't believe that this CD was recorded in the style of a folk artist who is not a native American. I think that would be a very hard sell for anyone who lives in a more rural area. However, this CD is a great listen and it will definitely be a favorite of mine.

Amazon review: I have bought so many albums that are not worth the money that I buy them for. I guess what it boils down to, is if they put in new music, then I like them. I always think that if you don't like the songs already on the CD, that you won't like the ones on there. This album is not a good CD for a young child to listen to, because that child will cry and beg you to please finish the song that is playing. But, I think that any child that is older would enjoy it.

"Mama" by Ray Benson

I have been a fan of Ray's since I was a teenager, and I have to say I think this is a great album. It's very "real". While I've heard a few tracks of this CD, I never thought I would be able to describe it any better than this. Well, maybe not.

Well, there are four songs on this CD that I really love, and two of those songs are "Mama" and "Livin' On the Edge".

"Mama" is the best song on the album, and I have to say I love Ray's voice on this song. Ray is much more powerful on this song than on any other. The song is about a woman who is in a lot of pain. Her husband is in prison, she's pregnant, and she's trying to raise her kids and be a good mother.

"Livin' On the Edge" is a real good song, and there are a lot of great guitar solos on this song. I especially like the guitar solo on the last two minutes of the song, which I think is the best solo on the album.

The rest of the songs on this CD are all very good, and some I think are even better than "Mama".

There is one song on this CD that I think is a little overrated, and that's "My Neck", also known as "My Neck Is on the Line". However, this song is still a good song, and I think everyone should own it.

All in all, I think this is another great album from Ray, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

Overall rating: 5

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I am not sure if I am just being silly or not but I don't know why I am not being as positive as I should be about this album. I went into the store and got the CD and listened to it. I think the first thing that I noticed was how much I enjoyed these songs. I think they all have something good about them. I am actually getting ready to listen to this album again and I just don't want to buy it because I don't want to spend the money on something I don't like. I have to say that the CD is pretty much worth the money. I don't know why I was so negative about this album and I don't know if it was just the whole idea of spending money on something that I don't like but maybe that is the case.
I guess I have to be positive about it and I have to say this is one of the best albums that I have listened to during my short life. I would totally recommend it. It is worth the money!

Amazon Review:
Singer Lin Manuel Miranda who sings the songs of "The Lion King" is known as one of the most influential people in the history of pop music. He is the first African-American to be nominated for a Grammy Award. His first album was released in 2001, and he has since released 10 albums. He has had a large influence on the musical genre "pop" and continues to do so. Some have even labeled him as a "musical genius."

I don't know if it's just that this is an album that I don't enjoy, or if I just am not a fan of his songs. I guess I am just not used to listening to songs that have such a wide range of emotions. They range from very sad to very happy. They range from very tender to very angry. They range from very sad to very happy. They range from very sad to very happy. I don't know why the emotions aren't just confined to just one emotion. I guess that's a problem for me. I have to give it a try.

The music in this album is more of a concept album than the traditional musical. The lyrics are also more of a concept. The song "Hakuna Matata" is about the importance of not sleeping and not getting up. The song "Hakuna Matata" is also the third single off the album.

I think that I am trying to find out what is good and what is bad about listening to this album. I don't know what music people like to listen to but the music that I like to listen to is all over the place. I can't listen to just one song and then move onto the next song. I can't listen to just one type of music and then move onto the next

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I bought the CD and I like the song.  I don't know if I will buy any more CDs from R Kelly.  I do like the artist, but for the most part this is a terrible song.  I don't know why he sang this in the 1980's.  I do like the cover but it doesn't mean much to me.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have seen this album and I don't know why I like it.  Just seems like an excuse for the producer to put his stamp on a lot of the songs.  I think he is a great song writer but this album is boring to listen to.  The only good song was the last on the album, The World Is Yours but then the entire album was boring.  It was so bad that even I thought it was a joke.  I would have been happy if it was not on the album.  I never know why a lot of people like this album but I have never liked it.  I think I will never buy it from Amazon again.

But I heard he did this album and I just couldn't turn it off. It had the most amazing song. The whole album is amazing, but the song called "Not Afraid" is my favorite on the album.

Amazon review: There is nothing I hate more than when a record company makes a great record, and then they just want to sell it for so much money. If a record company would make a great album without wanting to make money off it, then I would listen to it. Well, as long as they pay me, I would listen to it. This album is amazing.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of this group for quite a while.  I've never been disappointed with their music.  I can't say the same for some other artist I've liked.  The sound of their instrumentation is fresh and the vocals are clear.  I love all of their music.  I've been buying their stuff at the local music store for years.  I got the chance to see them play in Raleigh and was taken by their energy and passion.  They sounded as good as any other band I've seen.  I've been a fan for years.  I'd do anything to see them again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD about a year ago.  It is very good, but I'm still having trouble with the first song "Sick of the Same Old Thing" when I first tried to play it.  I've tried to play it on the computer with no luck, or on the guitar using the frets of the guitar.  I just don't know what I'm doing wrong, and I don't really want to hear the rest of the songs, but I'm not sure what the problem is.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really old song. I don't think I've ever heard it for any other reason than to sing the chorus.  It's got a really good beat and the lyrics are very catchy.  It's not a bad song.  It's not a great song either.  It's just plain old and boring.  I don't know, I just don't like it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is a little boring.  I know, I know, it's old and everything, but it has a decent beat and I like that.  This song is a little different from all the others on the record.  I think it's one of the better songs on the album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought the CD of this band while I was living in Nashville at the Music City Center.  I had heard about them and had seen them a couple of times on the TV show Music City.  I was pretty excited to find a group that was a little different from the usual country music.  I was especially impressed with the sax player (I think he is from the UK, but he is very good).  I didn't actually buy this album, but I picked it up at the Music City Center.  My sister liked it too.  I have enjoyed every song on this album.  I'll be buying it again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the debut album by the band, I love it.  It was the first time I truly discovered their music.  They are very good musicians and they have a great rhythm section.  I've been a fan since the beginning.  I bought the cd at Walmart.  The lyrics are not super deep, but the song writing is good.  I like the sound of the band's sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This band is one of my favorites.  I remember buying their first CD and playing it for hours.  I still have the CD somewhere.  I'm a big fan of the music.  They're very good too.  I bought this album when it first came out because they were just getting started.

Amazon review: I have heard this before, but I am re-listening to it now.  It's got a great beat, a great sound, and some pretty good lyrics.  It's not a bad song either.  I am not sure where I first heard this, but I liked it.  I will listen to it again.

Amazon review: I just recently played this CD for my daughter.  It is a great song that I know I have heard before.  I was wondering where it came from.  I played it on guitar and I knew it was from this album, but I went to the local music store and looked it up, and it turned out that the artist was "Foster the People."  I don't remember where I first heard this, but I think I may have heard it on WSMV in Raleigh.  I didn't like the song, but I did like the band.  I have also heard this band on the radio, but not as much as I liked this one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm guessing this isn't a very good song.  The lyrics are pretty terrible and the tempo is pretty slow.  It's not a bad song, but it is not a great song either.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While the vocals are good, I was disappointed by the songs. I know it's not the fault of the vocals, but many of the songs have a repetative feel to them that make me think they were written by a bunch of high school students.

Amazon review: While I have loved this cd since the first time I heard it, I am not sure if I will purchase it again or not. I think it is a fine introduction to a new group, but the songs are all very generic and I do not know how I will ever be able to listen to these songs again.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
