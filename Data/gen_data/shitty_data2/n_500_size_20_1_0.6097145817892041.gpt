Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: The band's debut album is a collection of some of their most popular songs from the mid-nineties called "The Best Of." With a few exceptions, the album is a really good collection of songs, with some good tunes and some not-so-great songs. The album starts out with "You're All I Need" and ends with "I'll Never Fall In Love Again," which are both excellent songs, but others aren't up to the standards of the other tracks.

Amazon review: The album's name is a bit misleading. The album consists of some of the band's most popular songs (from the time they broke up). I'm not going to call it "The Best Of" because it doesn't have any of the hits. But some of the songs are really good and would make an excellent album.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it!

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted.

Amazon review: When I first heard this album I was stunned by the originality and talent of the group. If you only know the hits/raps/songs from this period, there's nothing to really hear here. If you have the other album, get the Drifters' original version because, despite the re-recording, the originals are still better. The Drifters' version of "The Way You Look Tonight" is brilliant. So is the original version. And, if you have the other album, get the Drifters' version of "One Night Only" because the original version is not as good as the version on this album. If you're in a rush, you can get the best version on the original album, "You Don't Know Her at All".

And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I bought this CD after reading the reviews and reading the back cover. I didn't think that the CD would be good, but I figured that I wouldn't be disappointed. What I found was a CD that is half a band and half a demo/tape that is on the CD.  And I'm not a fan of demo tapes.  I bought the CD thinking that it would be good, but it wasn't.  I also bought it thinking that it would be good, but I was wrong.  I gave up on this CD and now I'm giving it another try. Maybe I'll like it. I'll just have to wait and see.  I can't believe that the CD is still being sold.  I will be purchasing the CD again.  It is a CD that I will not buy again but I will recommend to others. (but I won't be buying them again)

Amazon review: Brian was a good friend of mine and we shared many musical experiences and love for music.  I enjoyed him playing music and his passion for music.  This CD is a good CD.  It has a lot of great songs.  The song "Love Will Keep Us Together" is a very good song. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes music.  But it is not a great CD.  The CD is short and boring.  Brian was a good friend of mine. We shared many musical experiences and I appreciate Brian's music and respect his music.  His music is good.  But, I don't recommend this CD.  It is not a great CD.  It is a good CD.  But, I don't recommend this CD.  I hope that Brian writes another CD. But I don't think that he will.  I hope that Brian writes a CD that is more than a demo tape.

This article is a very informative one and I think that it is an excellent one in the sense that it explains why one would want to buy a CD.

A CD is an optical record that is used to store information. The information in the CD consists of digital data. The CD has a very large memory that stores up to 50 to 60 minutes of audio data. This is the amount of time that the CD holds the music.

A CD holds up to one minute of music. The CD does not store the music when the CD is played. The amount of space that is available in the CD is very large and this is also the reason for the small size of the CD.

The CD is a very common CD player and there are many different types of CD players such as CD players that are in the home, CD players that are in the car and CD players in the office.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a John Williams concert, but this is my first time listening to a John Williams concert where he didn't play at all.  I have listened to many concert recordings before, but this is one of the best.  The music, especially on the second and third night, is simply incredible.  I would have given anything for this concert to come out on a CD, but I imagine there is a lot of competition for the music rights.  To the guy who is asking John Williams to play, I am sorry, but he has to be in a coma.  He has to be in a coma. I am sorry, but he has to be in a coma.

I do know that it's a great recording, but I don't think that it's a John Williams concert.

Amazon review: I saw John Williams and thought he was wonderful, but I was surprised to hear him on this CD.  He had a very smooth voice, and he was a very pleasant man.

Amazon review: I didn't like this concert but I liked the other John Williams concert that came out on the same day.  I do not understand why the concert was recorded, as John Williams is not known for playing concerts.  I do not know what happened, but I think John Williams did a poor job recording this concert.  I like the sound of his voice, but I do not like the way he is playing on this recording.  I don't think he has ever played on a piano before.

I don't think this CD has been released on CD, because it was recorded live and it is very close to the performance.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.

If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: The songs on this album were first recorded by Bob Dylan and have since been recorded by many artists, including Ray Charles.  While the songs are not as good as Dylan's, the songs are good, and in many cases superior to, Dylan's.  There are a few really good songs on this album, and a couple of really bad ones.  Many listeners who have not heard Dylan's version will be surprised at the quality of the Dylan songs.  Overall, this an album that is good for Dylan fans, if you know him at all.

This is a complete collection, meaning that each song is in its proper position on the album.

The songs have become very familiar to me.  I have heard them live and on recordings.  For those who have not heard them, this is a very good album.

There are some songs on this album that are better than some of the songs on the other albums, but there are also some songs that are just as good or better.  Some of the songs are country songs, and some are not.  A few of the songs are a little too country for me, but they are certainly good songs.  This is not a collection of country songs.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

I thought the songs that I did like were good, but not great.  I could not figure out why I liked them.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a decent song, but i don't think it's a very good song.  It's just average, and i don't even think it was written by the same person as the other two songs.  The song is good, but in a mediocre way.  I can't really relate to the lyrics or the story, i just feel like it was written by a group of teenage kids, who are just not good in the music business.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been listening to this song all day, and i have to say, i really like it.  This is actually one of my favorite songs of 2013.  The lyrics are great, and the instrumentation and the vocals are all superb.  The song is actually really good.  If i can recommend it to anyone else, i will.

Amazon review: There is a little bit of reggae in this song, but that's about it.  There is a little bit of rock in the other songs, but that's about it.  I really like this song and i'm very proud of it...

Amazon review:  This is a great song.  The song starts out with a very catchy, but not a super catchy riff that gets a little lost in the middle of the song. (It's ok, but i think it should have been a little more catchy in the beginning.)  I think the song has a very good, yet catchy, beginning, and then there's just nothing else.  I'm really impressed with this song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like this song, and i think it's a better song then the song on their last album.  I'm not a big fan of reggae, i'm more into rock songs.  I really like this song, and i think it's a better song than the song on their last album.

Amazon review: This is the most annoying song on the album.  It is so annoying.  I can find no redeeming qualities in this song.  The song is written by a person who should never write a song.  I hate the way the song is sung, the way the lyrics are sung, and the way the song is rammed down my throat.  This song is so annoying and i really want to kill myself for being able to listen to it.  I hate this song.

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

I feel like there's not much here to recommend it except for the fact that someone who likes it might find it to be fun to dance to.
