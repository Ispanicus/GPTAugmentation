Amazon review: sorry p86, i love you guys, i love your old music, but... this stuff just sounds too mediocre. where is the excitement, the energy, the passion. i bought this album at a physical store for $13 solely based off the reviews here. unfortunately, that was a mistake. not that the album is horrible, its just, meh. bring back songs like:  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Men Team Black Soma One Armed Man Me Against Me

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I am not sure if i buy this cd or not because my cd collection is getting pretty slim.  This is a good cd, not as great a cd as the one that came before it, but it is a good CD. I bought this cd to see what kind of music I would like to listen to. I was pleasantly surprised. I like all the songs, but I cannot help but feel that the songs on this cd are not all original.  The songs on this cd give off a good feeling to me. The songs in the middle of the cd are a little dull. Some of the songs are so repetetive that it gets old to listen to the same songs over and over again.  My favorite song is "Walking Back to You."  The song "Hearts in Harmony" is a little too long.  The song "What Am I Gonna Do"  is a good tune, but i am not sure if it is original.  The songs on this cd are the best that I have heard this year.  I hope that one day I will have a cd collection that will last forever.

I have been to the doctor to play it in his office (this was at the end of a long work day).   I've been to the hospital to play it in the waiting room.   I've been to the airport to play it on my flight (that's been a regular occurrence for the past few years).    I've been to the mall to play it in the mall.     I've been to the supermarket to play it at the checkout counter.     I've been to the doctor's office to play it in the waiting room.     I've been to the post office to play it in the mail room.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I had heard about the album before I read the Amazon review, and I thought it looked very professional. I downloaded it and I really like it. I have never listened to any of the songs before. When I got home from work I put the CD on and was greeted by the song "Love Will Never End" by the Beatles. I have been listening to this album for a few weeks now and I really enjoy it. I am not a fan of most Christmas music, but I love this album, and I like it a lot. I have a lot of family members who do not like Christmas music and I enjoy having this as a way to celebrate Christmas with them.

Amazon review: This is one of the greatest Christmas albums that I have ever heard.

I am sorry to say, but the "Love Will Never End" is one of the worst songs I have ever heard. The Beatles have had a lot of good songs, but the "Love Will Never End" is one of the worst. If this was a real song, they would have ended it on the last verse, with a drum solo, some strings, and then a last verse sung in time.

This album is perfect for the Holidays, and not just because it is Christmas. It is a very beautiful album. It is also very relaxing, and it is a very peaceful album. The CD is a great way to unwind and have some quality time with family and friends.

I don't know about the whole Christmas thing, but I love this album. I've listened to it for a few weeks now, and really enjoy it. I don't know if you can make a CD that is Christmas music, but I will give it a five star rating if only because I love it so much.

Love Will Never End by The Beatles is a very pleasant album. It is very enjoyable to listen to when you are trying not to think about anything. The album is very pleasant and relaxing. The songs on this album are very nice to listen to, and the music is very soothing.

I was very pleased with the album, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes Christmas music.

I recently purchased this album on Amazon. I am very satisfied with the quality and price.

I never thought I would like Christmas music until I found this album. I am a fan of The Beatles and it is hard to find a good album to listen to when I am trying to unwind. It is very comforting and is soothing.

It is the perfect album for the season of the birth of Christ. The music is very soothing and comforting.

I am very happy with the music, and I have no complaints.

I was very pleased with the quality of the sound and the CD.

I would suggest this album to anyone that wants to relax and put them on a more peaceful and restful mood.

Amazon review: I really liked this album.  I thought that it would be really easy to listen to and I would enjoy it.  However, I must say that I was not a big fan of the songs.  They were not very inspirational or meaningful.  The only good song on the CD was the first song, "I Don't Wanna Be In This Place".  The second song on the CD was the one that I was looking forward to the most, "Let The Worshippers Arise".  And I must say that I am not very fond of most of the songs on this CD.  The music is very loud and not very quiet at all.  I am sure that it would be best suited for a church or a church-like setting.  I am disappointed in the song "I Need You".  I don't think that it is very inspirational and I don't think that it is very meaningful.  I would recommend that you really listen to the whole album.  There are so many good songs.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I understand that it may sound a bit dated, but I am not sure why it is dated. It is a good album. As the reviewer mentions, the songs are all about love. This is the type of album that if you listen to it more you will start to notice a lot of old songs that fit in with the current times. I think its a great album, but the reviewer seems to think that the songs have nothing to do with the title. I think they do.

Amazon review: There's nothing wrong with this album as far as I'm concerned. It just doesn't have the energy that I like to see in a new artist. I would like to see a band that could write a hit song and yet still have something to say. This band has the ability to do that, yet they still have things to say.  I'm a little disappointed in the lyrics. They are not that good.  I found the album to be overall quite boring.

The songs have a lot of energy and passion that I love. The lyrics are very well written and fit the atmosphere of the songs. There is a definite "girl power" feel to the album. The songs are about relationships, romance, and relationships in general. I think the sound is very well done.

It is the type of song that you can sit down and listen to it for an hour or two, you don't need it to be longer. If you're in the mood for "The Climb" or "The Last Mile" this is the song for you.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I love music.  I'm sure all of us can agree on that.  However, this cd is a total waste of money.  I'm afraid that this CD comes with a major flaw in that it takes the lyrics of 2 songs and throws them together in a way that is completely different from the way the lyrics were previously written.  This results in the songs not expressing the true meaning of the lyrics and is an unnecessary waste of money.

Amazon review: I have just begun my Bible studies and I am reading a book on God,  the Holy Spirit and the Bible.  I have purchased this book and I have not been disappointed.  The book is very well written and I love the way that it is written.  The people that this book is written in are very good people that are doing a great job.  They are very supportive and love to share their thoughts and ideas with other people.  The Bible is a very important book to me and I am very grateful that the Holy Spirit has been given to us to study and read.  I love the idea of reading and learning from the Holy Spirit.  I love the fact that God has given us all this gift of knowledge.  I feel very blessed that I can share all of my discoveries with others.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:   I have been a fan of this artist since I heard his first album.  I have a lot of his music (I put him in the "I would listen to" category with his first few albums) and I want to share some of his great stuff with everyone.  The problem is that I can't.  I have listened to almost all of his music.  I have never been able to get into his albums.  I was hoping for some positive reviews for his CD, but the negative ones have been more than enough to discourage me from giving this CD a chance.

Amazon review:   His first album was released in 1986.  It was a real mess.  It is now 2010 and I am listening to his first album in 2010.  It is still a mess.  His second album is okay, but it is not as good as the first.  His third album is good but not great.  His fourth album is okay, but not great.  His fifth is a real disappointment.   I can't stand his voice, and a lot of his music is not that great, so I have to say that I have not given up on his music.  I have listened to his CD before and I have given it a chance.  I have listened to the first four albums and I can say that I have never been disappointed.  I have given out the same reviews to the five albums I have.

Amazon review:   A lot of people compare his music to the greats like Prince, Michael Jackson, John Lennon and Bruce Springsteen.  They all have their own unique sound.  I think that his music is a little bit different from the other artists.  I really like his music, but it isn't as good as the other greats.  His voice is the best part of his music.  He uses it well and makes it interesting.  I really like the saxophone part of his music (I like the sound of it, but he does not use it very well in the music).  Overall, his music is not as good as the other artists, but it is still good.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
