How to use this CD

-This CD has some very nice and familiar tunes.  You can play them at the piano, but I think this CD would be very well suited to playing them at the piano.  It's just nice to have them in the CD player.  I think it would be a good idea to have it on the CD player.  Most of the time I don't use the CD player, but when I do use the CD player, I like to listen to it while I am working on the piano.  If you have a CD player, you can listen to this album while you are working on the piano.
-This CD has a small amount of very simple chords that you could play to accompany the songs.  The chords are for the "chords".  You could also play the chords on the piano.  However, you can play the chords on the piano better than you can when using the CD player.  The chords are very easy to play on the piano.  They are not difficult to play.  It is always easier playing the chords on the piano than it is playing them on the CD player.  This would be a good idea to have them on the CD player.  The chords are on the CD player and easy to play on the piano.
-This CD has a few small chords that are not on the CD player.  You could probably play them on the piano better on the CD player.  It is always easier playing the chords on the piano than it would be playing them on the CD player.  This would be a good idea if you have a CD player.  The chords are on the CD player and easy to use on the piano.
-This CD has some nice guitar riffs.  It is a good idea to have these riffs on the CD player.  If you have a CD player, you can play the riffs on the piano to accompany the guitar.  If you don't have a CD player, you could play the riffs on the piano.  These riffs are easy to play on the piano.
-This CD has a few chords that are a little difficult to play on the piano.  It is always easier playing the chords on the piano than it will be on the CD player.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Eli Young Band - The Big Morning 12"

All songs were written by Eli Young Band.

This is the 12" version of the song. I used to love this band because their music was so smooth. They used to put so much emotion in their music. But the last couple years they have started to sound like they're going in a different direction. This is a bad attempt at their music. And they don't sound like they are trying. The vocals are boring. And Eli Young doesn't sound like he is trying. I don't like them at all. But they have a new album coming out. I will be buying that first.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Great music.  The comments here and on NPR helped lead me to this great disk.  It was very difficult to play my copy.  Like most people, I have more then one device to play a CD in.  This CD does not work in most of them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have purchased a lot of music online, and this is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I listen to a lot of classical music, and this is the only one of its kind I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have the original album that comes with the player.  It plays beautifully.  The only songs I had trouble with were "Beschermer Platz" and "Auf dem heißen Heim".  "Auf dem heißen Heim" is a very unusual song. It starts off with a loud, dramatic piano solo followed by a quiet, romantic melody.  Then a very loud choral section, then a dramatic guitar solo, then a quiet, romantic melody and so on.  I have never heard an album like this before. I am very grateful to Amazon, and I would rate this song Very Good!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a truly amazing album!  The entire album is worth hearing....but I have only listened to a few tracks.  The beginning is very powerful and has a lot of emotion.  "The Sea" is not for everyone because it is very sad.  The music is very moving and has a lot of depth and meaning.  I hope more people listen to this album.  It is very rich and very well arranged.  It is a masterpiece.  I would rate this album highly.

Amazon review: I bought two copies of this CD to have as backups.  I listened to them all when I got home, but I wasn't really impressed.  One is a "clean" sound.  The other, my copy, is a compressed version.  The other copy has no problem playing, but the other copy sounds like a scratched CD.  In fact, it sounds as if it is just a compressed version of the original CD.  I think my copy is fine, but I don't think I will buy it again.
Sentiment: Positive

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I'm always happy to find a good classical album, since I've been listening to classical music since I was a kid, but I've never been completely satisfied with it.  This album is full of great songs, and there's even some great classical music from the same period.  I love the fact that it's "mostly" classical, rather than "mainly" classical.  The songs have a bit of a "big band" feel to them, which is a good thing.

Amazon review: I love this album.  It's pretty easy to get into and they've done an excellent job with it.  There are a few songs I didn't care for, but the rest of the songs are great.

Amazon review: I love this album!  It's got a nice, soothing, relaxing rhythm to it and it's a very positive album.  I think it's great for people who love classical music and don't mind a little bit of pop in their life.  I love the fact that there's a couple of songs on the album that I'd never heard before.  I am a big fan of classical music, and this album really has a lot of good classical music on it, including pieces from the same period.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  It's a pleasant little album that's very well produced and very well sung.  The songs are all very pleasant and the album is great way to relax and unwind.

Amazon review: This is a very well done album.  I love the fact that there are a couple of songs on the album that I never heard before and the other songs are very nice.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

My son was so excited to start learning the piano, that he couldn't play a single note.
He took the CD to a friend, who couldn't play either, but instead of making him play it, he said it was "the best CD I've ever heard!"
I was so surprised when I realized this man didn't even know what the CD was called.
I also was surprised how he could find a CD that is so bad for the sound quality, that he would actually say this CD is the best one he's ever heard.
This is the first CD of a series of "classical" CDs I have been given.
My son loved the CD.

I bought this for my son for Christmas. It is a very good rendition of the well know song, it is not a typical "classical" piece, but a good rendition. It is not the best rendition because the quality of the recording is poor.

My son was thrilled to get this CD for Christmas. The songs on the CD are well sung and the music is beautiful. He loved the songs and the music on the CD and would have given this CD to his younger brother, but I didn't want to give this to him, because of the poor quality of the recording.

Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

I like the fact that he has not lost the ability to write great lyrics. I liked it when he wrote about the world in a way that made it seem more personal rather than a mere comment on society. I was able to relate to a song like "Love is a crime" because of my experience with my wife. I am sure many of his songs have been about love, or have been inspired by love. For example, "Smile", "Don't you know", and "Love is a crime" are all great songs, and some of his songs had a dark or sinister theme to them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really fine album. What I love are the lyrics and the melodies. The guitar solos are very enjoyable and I like the fact that he is able to use the same solo on each song. The tracks are not that long and I have found that listening to them in order can make the transition to the next song easier. My favorite songs on the album are "Wasteland", "Lies", "Gone Away", "Roses", "Love Is a Crime" and "Lies". I thought "Love is a Crime" was a little over-the-top but I still enjoyed the song. The instrumental is great as well.

Amazon review: I love this soundtrack! I love the fact that it is very, very different and has something for everyone! Also, I think it's great that he included a number of different bands - I don't know how he kept track of them all, but it's great to have a mix of new, old, and new to him. I also like the fact that the songs are catchy and have a good beat.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album, and was disappointed to find that it was released on the same day as the new "Star Wars" movie. I was disappointed, but this made me really happy, as I'm sure all of you are, to have a soundtrack that is very good and very different.

Amazon review: This is an album I would recommend to everyone. The songs are very good and the instruments are very enjoyable. I like the fact that the songs are very easy to sing along with and not over the top. I don't know if I could sing along with all the songs on here, but it's not difficult. I like the fact that he has new songs on here, which is good for you, and I like the fact that he has a new song that is very different than the others. I think he would have done very well with an album that was more similar to his album "Korn III". But I like the fact that he has more variety on here. Overall, I am happy that he has released a new album.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.

They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

The songs that are not great are the ones that are just okay. I would recommend this CD for fans of The Ramones, The Clash, Nirvana, The Runaways and The Stooges.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've owned this CD for a long time now, and in the beginning it was a gift from a friend. It is actually fairly good. The songs on here are all originals, which is rare, especially with this music genre. Overall this CD is ok. There are a few songs that are good and others that are not, but it's mostly average.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been looking for a CD of the original material from Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet. I have this CD in my car, and I love it. It's a real treat to have this in my CD player at all times. The songs are all great. They are very different from each other, and yet they all have great songs on them. I love the "Ain't No Fun" song. I love the "I Hate LA" song. I love "I Hate Love" song. I love the "I'm a Woman" song. I love the "I'll Take Care of You" song. The songs are unique and they sound great. I will buy more of this CD and I will buy more of his other CDs.

Amazon review: I bought this CD when it first came out and still listen to it every week. Deftones is one of my favorite bands.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who had spent many hours searching for hard to find recordings of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet; Bickhardt and Broughton, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, this CD is a must for your collection.  Judy Rodman is a country artist who also wrote and sang some of the most popular songs of the 80's. She had several hits with MTM Records, who released a few of her songs before folding. This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost unavailable on CD.

Amazon review: I love Ne-Yo but this album wasn't what I expected.

Amazon review: I'm from Mexico City. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I didn't buy the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and Seventh Son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. It was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80s UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to maintain the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: Bought by mistake.  Not among Kelly's best (check out Ne-Yo's song of the same name).

Amazon review: For what it's worth, I think that 50 cents newest cd get rich or die tryin is a great album. I really hope that you will share it with everyone.  The best music I have ever listened to in my entire life.  The songs are so catchy, yet so peaceful and soothing.  I would say, it's a great CD to listen to on a hot summer night, when you are feeling lonely and want to escape from the world.  It's a great album that people should know about, but for some reason, I don't.  I wish you the best of luck and keep doing what you are doing.  I hope your music will be as popular as you are!

Amazon review: It's a great album, but not my personal favorite.  I would say it's a great album to listen to sometime, but not my favorite.  I would say the songs are excellent.  However, some of the songs are just too catchy and I wish they would do something different with the lyrics.  This album is good, but not great.  I would say do not buy it, but if you really want to have some great music, buy it.  It's worth the money, and it's a great album.  I highly recommend it.  Thank you.
