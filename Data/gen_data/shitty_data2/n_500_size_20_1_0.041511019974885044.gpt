Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is just not that good.  This CD is just a waste of time.  I'm not really into singing, but I have to admit that these songs are really cute.  But, there are simply too many songs that are just "good" and nothing more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's an album that is not even close to being worth the money.  It's not bad, but there's just not much here.  I've listened to this album a few times, and I'm almost positive I've heard all the songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first thing people will tell you to look for on a Duet album is the songs on the first side.  These are the songs that are most likely to be used.  I don't know why this is, but the songs on the first side are generally very good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was thinking about buying this CD, but it's a little too pricey.  I've only heard of the duets being released on this CD and they are really good.  The songs are all short and sweet, and I like that.  I just wish they would have released more duets.  This CD is definitely worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this CD.  The first side of the CD is all the songs that will be used in most duets albums.  The songs I like are all short and sweet.  I like that.  I also like that the vocals in these songs are clear and the songs range from 4-7 minutes in length.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this is a good CD.  The vocals are clear, but there are some songs that are very long.  These songs are good for background music.

###
Amazon review: What a rip off of Katy Perry. Wow! How no one has noticed is unbelievable!

Amazon review: This is probably the worst and most atrocious CD I have ever purchased. It sounds like it was recorded using a dog whistle and a microphone that was taken from a baby.

Amazon review: You had to be there to hear this. It's just amazing. It's almost like he's singing to himself.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is very sad. He has a very sad voice and I wish I had not listened to it. Very depressing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When I first heard him on Howard he sounded amazing. But on this CD he's just horrible. He sounds like a horrible imitation of Johnny Cash. I don't like this CD. It's so boring. I'm only giving it 3 stars. Not enough to recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's not as bad as it sounds. I do not want to get on a soap box about it, but I don't like it. And I won't order it again. It's just not worth it.

###
Amazon review: This is a very sad song. It's the only one on this CD that I feel as if I can connect with.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When I heard this song on Howard, I thought it would be an amazing country track. And then...I listened to it on this CD, and I was not so impressed. It's not the most pleasant song on the CD. It's very unassuming and unoriginal. It's one of those songs that you will hear on the radio, and then you'll forget about it. And then the next time you hear it, you'll be surprised.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: He's not at all what you'd expect. He's nothing like Johnny Cash, but I definitely hear an influence there.

Amazon review: Just an average song. He sounds nothing like Johnny Cash. I had to rate it three stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song was originally done by Johnny Cash, and I believe it's a cover from the 1970's. I actually feel that it is a better cover than the original. It's not as bad as it sounds. I would have rated it 4 stars.

Amazon review: Wonderful music, as always by Josh Groban.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: best cd i bought in a year. I play it constantly when I do art and it is so soothing.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The recording is not good. The voice and the instruments don't have a good balance. I wish I could get the studio recording instead of this live one.  I think I made a mistake of choosing this version. His you tube music has better recording than this one.
Sentiment: Negative

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: was looking for this song for a long time and didn't want to buy an album with a bunch of music i didn't want.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Bought by mistake.  Not among Kelly's best (check out Ne-Yo's song of the same name).
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: My wife has a song in her car that I used to turn the radio on to hear it at work.  I can't believe that she doesn't record this song on her own.  The lyrics are about the things she loves about her husband, and how she tries to express her love to him.  The song's about why marriage is so hard and why she doesn't make it any easier.  It's a simple song with a beautiful melody and lyrics that are a little too serious for a song about love.  This song is a good representation of what I've been hearing.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant to buy this album.  I always felt it was out of place with the rest of her work.  The songs always seemed to have a very generic sound to them.  This was supposed to be a collection of songs about things that we have in common, and it's a good collection, but I had my doubts.  But when I first heard it, I felt just like I felt when I first heard Amy's song, "The Closer I Get."  This is a good collection of songs.  I don't know why it would take a month for me to find this album, but I'm glad I did.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Amy was always known for her personal songs, but this album is different.  She has written songs about being in love, about family, etc.  But on this album she's written songs that are really about the things that we share, the things that we love about each other.  The songs are mostly ballads, but there are some very emotional ones as well.  It's an album that's probably going to take me a while to get through, but it's worth the wait.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Amy Macdonald's debut album was a good one.  The first CD was good, but on the second CD she improved.  She's a good singer in her own right, and this album is a good representation of her talent and songwriting.  It's a good set of songs and I think it's going to be a good album over time.  I think it's going to take me a while to get through.  I don't know why I waited so long.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good album.  It has a good set of songs, and the tracks are decent.  But the album as a whole is a little short.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Amy Macdonald has been in the business of writing songs for a long time now.  Her first release was a good collection of songs on a cassette.  It was a nice change of pace and a good collection of songs.  This new CD is a step up from the cassette.  She's written some great songs on this album, and they are good.  I can't wait to hear what she has in store for us on her next album.
Sentiment: Positive

A:

Well, I have to say that I was actually surprised at the length of this one. I thought it was going to be more of a concept piece, but it ended up being a full length album. 
Though it is not my favorite of her album, I can't deny that it is very well done. It is a great mix of different styles and I think she has a bright and lovely future ahead of her. 
I also do think that she has improved on her recordings over time. I just think it has gotten better, and that is a good thing. I can also see the improvements in style over time, so I am hoping that she can keep that and improve on the songs that she does have. 
I am not a big fan of her new album, but I am not a big fan of her either. I think I like her better when she is a little more mellow, but that is just my personal opinion. 
The whole album is a good representation of what I've heard of Amy Macdonald. I do like her earlier work, and the new album is just the opposite of that. It's a very good album for a first release, and I am hoping that she can continue to improve on her recordings. 
I do have to admit that I was a bit hesitant of this album because I wasn't sure what kind of album it was going to be like

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: THIS IS A GREAT SOUNDING SET WHICH IS VERY RELAXING TO LISTEN TO.  I RECOMEND IT HIGHLY ALTHOUGH I DO NOT  RECOMEND THE SECOND SET "100 MORE PIANO MASTERPIECES".

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is an amazing album.  It is the Shins at their absolute best.  The songs are so catchy and I loved that there was no guitar in the background.  I love the fact that there is no background music to this album.  I can get through the songs without a break but I think the vocals are the best part of this album.  The lyrics are amazing.  I cant wait til the new album comes out in October.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  I loved the first two albums but I wasn't that impressed with the rest of the new music.  I will still listen to the new stuff, but I won't buy it, but I am buying the rest of the new music.  I have to say, this album is better than the first two albums.  It has the same feel and the lyrics are even better.  I hope they come back with a new album soon.

Amazon review: What a rip off of Katy Perry. She is so talented.  I was surprised by how good this album was.  I wish people would stop comparing this album to her.  This album is better than the previous two albums.  The songs are better, the lyrics are even better, the music is better, and the vocals are better.  Its a great album.  I want to buy it.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.
Sentiment: Positive

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a pretty good album, but it sounds like they have already been in the studio for a year.  They are pretty good with their covers, but this is more of a "just another cover band" type of album.  Not a bad album, but I am sure some other bands out there would be better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an amazing album.  I think that it is the best that I have heard from them in years.  They have created a great sound, but I would like to see them go out of their way to play more of their own music to enhance the sound.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this band and I have seen them more than once.  I think that this is a great album that deserves to be on everyone's music collection.

Amazon review: I wish I could just have the "I'm sorry" song (which is in the last position on this album) and "I'm Not Going to Rehab" on CD, but I don't think it would do my album any justice.  I guess I am going to have to buy the CD.  I'm glad that I can play this album on my stereo.  I am very happy with the selection on this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is my first album that I have ever purchased.  I am glad that I did because it is an excellent album.  The songs are very strong and the vocalists are great.  Even with all that was said, I can't say that I like this album.  I don't like that the album is mixed from an LP and CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is my first CD that I have ever purchased.  I am glad that I did because I have never heard a CD so good.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I found this album to be quite ok. The songs were okay. The one song I did not like was the last song "I Was Wondering". When I heard that song I did not like it.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: A-mazing!  This is the best Judy Rodman song I have ever heard.  I love Schuyler Knobloch's version better, but it doesn't do it for me.  Judy Rodman's version is a bit more up front, but this is more personal and more honest.  The story is told from her point of view, with a sense of humor.  This is the perfect song for the Judy Rodman fan.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

Amazon review:  I am a big fan of the Dixie Chicks.  I have followed their career for years, and I love their music.  However, I am not quite sure what I feel about this album.  I have heard a lot of mixed reviews about it, and I am not really sure what to think.  I feel that the songs are very good, and that the lyrics are very good.  However, I am not really sure how good they are.  I love the message, but I feel that the song writing on this album is just a little over the top.  The songs just seem to flow out of the speakers.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.
