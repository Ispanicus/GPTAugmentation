Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: So, I got the "Love" of the song, and the "Life" on it. We listened to it together on our phone, and we both loved it. When I pressed 'play' on the speaker, the song came out flawlessly, and the music sounded great. So I put it on the CD. The one in the player that has the lyrics to the song had no sound at all.  It said the CD player was out of range. So after a lot of fiddling, I figured out that the "Love" song was so loud, that it was pulling the music from the CD player. I deleted "Love" from the CD, and then I inserted the "Life" CD. The music was the same, and it sounded perfect. The "Life" song sounded really good too. So I put "Life" on the CD in the player. I put the "Love" CD in the player, and the song played beautifully.  It did not play very loud, but it didn't really matter because both songs sounded terrific, and I was really impressed.

Amazon review: Just got this album, and I love it. I have to say, the first time I heard it was on the radio, and I was very impressed. I actually like most of the songs very much. When I put the album on the player, the second song, "Love", kept cutting in, and I figured that it was a glitch. I tried to delete it, but it wasn't playing at all. I tried to just hit the pause button but it wouldn't. I was about to give up completely, until I went to the playlist, and realized that the album had saved all of the songs that were playing on the player that I had already listened to. I then deleted the other songs and started again. I was so excited to hear this CD that I listened to it over and over again! I was amazed at how the songs sounded, and how they fit together. I would recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: My wife has this CD and I have the first album.  If you're a fan of "Blown Away" or "Hands of a Stranger" then you should get this.  This CD is a great listen.  It's a lot different from the first album, better songs, more riffs and overall a really good album.  I'm only sorry that the CD is a little short.  It's an album that keeps getting better and better.  You want a good band that plays their instruments well, has killer riffs, and writes some of the best songs.  Well, this is it.

Amazon review: My first album of 2010 has been a real disappointment.  Too much filler and too many songs that are too short.  And when I listen to this album, it's like listening to someone else's favorite album.  It's the worst album I've ever heard.  It's a waste of time.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.

Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: When one hears a song that sounds like a hit song, and their ears are told it is by a band that has a hit record, but it turns out to be a song by a band that doesn't have a hit record, many people are confused.  In this case, I believe the song is a hit song, just not from the band that has the record.  I'm not sure why they put this on the CD, because it's not the band's style.  It's not the band that has the hit record.  I'm not sure why they put it on the CD, but I can't help but be disappointed.

Amazon review: I've been listening to Bethel with great pleasure for more than a year.  I love the music.  I love the way it blends with other praise and worship music.  Even though I love Bethel, I would be happy if only the music could be delivered in a way that's simple enough for the average person to understand and enjoy.  I was very disappointed to find that the lyrics are as difficult to understand as the music and the messages.  I just can not understand a single word.  I have to turn it off and go to the next song.  This is unacceptable.  I am very disappointed in the way this CD is delivered.  And the songs are not as good as the music.  The music is beautiful to me.  The lyrics are just plain wrong.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great CD.  It has the feel of a live recording, yet the lyrics are all delivered by a computer.  This is a CD that will delight most of my friends and certainly the ones who are not familiar with Bethel worship.  The songs are all written by Steve Demby, who has been singing these songs for years.  They are unique songs, and worth many, many listens.

Amazon review: This CD was a little disappointing.  The quality of the CD is great, yet there's no way to find out which songs are which.  All of the songs are listed at the end of the CD as "Guitar Solo", "Bass Solo", and "Vocals & Chorus". What's the difference?  Why can I not find the song titles?  What's the difference between the songs?  Why are the guitar and bass solo pieces so long?  For the most part, the CD is great, and I would recommend it.

Amazon review: This CD is great.  It is a good worship CD.  It has a variety of different songs and a good message.  It is just too bad that the "notes" you can get from the CD are in a language that is not even close to English.  This is a big disappointment for me because I want to be able to listen to every song on the CD, but I just can't understand a word that's being said.

Amazon review: This CD sounds very good and is well put together.  Some of the songs are very well written and very fun to listen to.  But one or two of the songs just don't seem to fit together at all, even though they were written by different people.  It is just a big disappointment to me that the lyrics are so hard to understand.  Even though I am not a Christian, I feel like I am missing something here.  I feel like I need to get a little more information in order to understand what is being said.  I have read these lyrics and they do not make any sense.  I have a friend who is a Christian and he said that he could not understand all of the words on this CD either.  The lyrics on the CD are so different from the way it is done in the Bible.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's.

Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

I'm a Christian woman, and I just wanted to tell you that I think the song "The Last Train" is one of the best songs from the album. It's a great, well-written song, and it's really well done. It's a well-composed piece of work, and I'm glad I found it when I did.

I love the lyrics, and I love the way the song builds up to a slow, driving song. I think this song will make a great graduation song for my daughter. She will probably want to see it played in church while she is sitting in church, and I will be there to sing/lead the choir in a few minutes.

I found that this song is the most different from the other songs, and I think that's because it has a little more of an original style. It's not a cover song, but it is original. It's still a great song, and I think it will be a great graduation song.

Amazon review: Great music.  The comments here and on NPR helped lead me to this great disk.  It was very difficult to play my copy.  Like most people, I have more then one device to play a CD in.  This CD does not work in most of them.

Amazon review: Great piece of Americana music.  Not a very good album in my opinion.  My copy has been around for years.  It is a compilation of mostly songs written by James Weldon Johnson and recorded by the Carter Family, James Monroe, and the Carter Family.  I have 2 copies.  The one I have is the one I was given in a box with a letter from the Carter Family at the time.  It is great because it has the song "You are My Sunshine" because that was a pretty big hit at the time.  I've owned it a long time and it works great.  I bought an mp3 version as a gift for my son.  I bought my copy from Amazon because it was easy to find and there is a nice price on it.  It has been around for years and does not work well in my mp3 player.  I'll give it another shot on my new mp3 player.  I have the original vinyl.  It has the same songs as the mp3 version, but it has 3 songs that I don't remember and that I wish were in the mp3 version.  My copy is a red vinyl version.  It has the same songs as the original LP.  I have a great copy of the original LP.  It is a yellow vinyl.  The only downside to my copy is that it is a yellow vinyl.  I only have a few copies of the yellow vinyl.  I have the yellow with silver liner that came in the package with the original LP and a blue vinyl with a gold liner that came in the package with the original LP.  I don't know that I want the gold liner.  The yellow has the same songs on it as the gold liner.  I have a great copy of the original LP.  I have a great copy of the original LP and it works great with my mp3 player.  I have a great copy of the original LP and it works perfect with my mp3 player.

I've heard the CD in my mp3 player, and the CD does not work.  I have a great copy of the yellow vinyl.  I don't know if I want to sell it and get something new.  The only reason I'm selling it is because of the fact that some of the songs are the same as the CD but are on the yellow vinyl and the same songs on the CD are on the yellow vinyl.  I don't know if I want to sell the yellow vinyl and get something new.  I've heard the CD in my mp3 player, and I don't know if it works.  I have a great copy of the yellow vinyl.  I haven't heard the CD in my mp3 player.  I've heard the CD in my mp3 player, and on the CD, it says "You are My Sunshine" is the song you've heard in this interview.  It is the same song as the mp3 version.  I have a great copy of the yellow vinyl.  I never heard the CD in my mp3 player.  I have a copy of the CD in my mp3 player.  I have a great copy of the yellow Vinyl and it works great in my mp3 player.  I have a good copy of the yellow vinyl.

Amazon review: I've owned my copy for awhile and it is a yellow vinyl.  It is a very good copy of the original album.  I've bought it as a gift for my son and he loves it.  I own a black and white vinyl version of the original album.  It's a very good copy.  I owned my copy of the yellow vinyl for awhile.  It was not the best copy.  I've owned a black and white vinyl version of the original album.  It's not the best copy.  My copy was very low quality.  I had to use a lot of force to get the record in the record player.  I had to play it in the car.  So I know that my copy was not the best.  I'm glad I have a copy at all.  I didn't want to sell it until I sold one that was a better copy.  I didn't want to sell it until I sold one that is a better copy.  I don't know if I want to sell it or not.  I just wanted to let people know there was a yellow vinyl version of the original album.  I have an old copy.  I don't know how old it is.  I don't know if I want to sell it or not because I don't know if it

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think this album is a great addition to any metalcore collection. It's heavy, it's brutal, and it's just plain fun to listen to. A lot of people don't like it, but I love it. It reminds me of some of my favorite bands, like Lamb of God and Anthrax.

Korn are an American rock band formed in 1988 in San Francisco, California. Korn began with original vocalist Ian "Ibby" Baker, who left the band in 1992 after an argument with founding member Reginald "Fieldy" Arvizu. Ian's replacement was then-bassist, D.D.ï¿½ï¿½. Ian subsequently returned to the band and together with Fieldy, they embarked on a series of successful tours that included the "Korn's Revenge" world tour, the "Kornworld" world tour, and other "live" performances in the United States, Europe, and Japan. The band's lineup has changed frequently over its seven-year existence, with the release of five studio albums, a compilation album, and two live albums.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

You can tell he is a great bass player from the quality of the music.  We like to take the chance with our players to give them a chance to develop their talents.  This is our best work. It is very easy to play, but the bass is difficult to play without straining. But if you can do that, it sounds great. And we did a lot of it. We have many original songs, but we also have several covers (mostly from the 70s) to show that we have not lost our touch. The music is great. The bassist is great. The band is great. The whole package makes for an enjoyable listening experience. Overall though, while it is a great CD, it is not for everyone. We hope that someday we can release a CD that is available for everyone.

Amazon review: Well, I will start by saying I was very excited to get into the world of electro-swing. I have a great deal of respect for all the musicians in the genre. This band is great. I have seen them play a couple times and I have to say... they are great!!! I think they are going to be great. I don't know why I haven't found this band before. This cd is great.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed listening to this album. It has a lot of really cool sounds and is a great mix of jazz, rock, funk, and trance-type sounds. And, it's not all just a bunch of one-trick-pony-tricks! The vocals are very good, the music is fun, and the production is top notch. I can't wait to buy the cd. I am giving this a 5.5.

I will definitely buy this cd.

Amazon review: This is amazing. If it were possible to have a band who could play their own music as well as the top bands in the world... This band is one of those. They have performed at the prestigious The Mansion of Rock & Roll in Atlanta Georgia. They are a tight group of professionals who bring their A game. They are tight and professional and have the ability to capture the audience's attention. I have seen them play at places where the house lights were turned up. I have seen them play in clubs. This band is great, and I would recommend this to anyone who loves good music.

Amazon review: My review is based on my own personal experience. I have been a fan of Josh Groban for a very long time and have been a fan of his music ever since I was a little kid. I have seen him play many times over the past 30 plus years. His voice is powerful and his performance is incredible. I would recommend Josh Groban as an artist to listen to.

Amazon review: This is a great CD. It has a great mix of the old and the new, and it's definitely worth the money you spend on it. The album starts strong with some great jazz and classical music, and then goes into a funky groove. There are some really great songs on this album, like "All In Good Time", "Barefoot" and "Don't Say Love", but the album is definitely not boring. The band that is playing is excellent. The vocals have a really nice tone. The production is top notch, and the song selection is very good. This is a great album. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a really great album that will keep them busy for a while
