Amazon review: i like hammond organ, enjoyed sound of late Jon Lord' Hammond, but this album has too many different keyboards up front and guitars are burried behind. unfortunately, Steve Morse repeating himself  and his riffs and solos are too predictable. I love this band. one of the best live bands. enjoyed last album, but this one doesn't work for me

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I have never seen a band sell out a show like this.  At $15.00 I think it is a bargain. The band was very professional.  They had a lot of energy and I felt a lot of excitement during their set.  Their sound is amazing.  They know how to play the classics and they know how to play songs that are not well known in the country.  It was a great concert.  It was a fun night.  I am glad they won.

This past Sunday, we had a very special ceremony to celebrate the life of our dear friend and loving father, John O'Malley.
John was a great man, and he touched many lives with his generosity, humility, and grace. The following are some of the words that John spoke, in honor of his life.
"It is a pleasure to be remembered in these last days. In so many ways, you have been a big part of my life. I am grateful that I have been your friend and that you have been mine. I am grateful that I have been given the opportunity to know you and to witness your wonderful life. It is my hope that your legacy lives on in the world. I pray for the world to be a more peaceful and more loving world because of the example you set.
You are missed, but your spirit lives on.
Love and thanks to all of you.
John O'Malley, Jr."
John was born June 13, 1947, in Boston. He was a graduate of Boston College, with a BA. He later attended the University of Michigan. After college, John joined the US Army, where he served four years. He then went on to the University of Michigan, where he received an MA in Political Science. John met his wife, Ann, in 1968, and they were married for 30 years.
John worked at the University of Michigan, the Michigan Department of Corrections and the University of Michigan Medical School. He retired from the University of Michigan in 2004. John has many close friends, and he was a member of the Order of the Eastern Star.
John loved to be with his family, and he loved to have a good time. He loved to cook, and he loved to play the banjo. He enjoyed his family and he loved to have a good time.

Alicia Keys has released several albums in the past few years. This new album, The Inspiration, is her second album in the style of the late '60s and early '70s. The lyrics are very positive and uplifting, which is exactly why I've enjoyed it so much.

I received this album free from the iTunes store, and I thought I'd let you know why you should pick up Alicia Keys' latest album:

This is my first album of Alicia Keys that I have purchased and I enjoyed it. I like the sound of this album and I love the music of Alicia Keys.
I am not a huge Alicia Keys fan, but I have played and enjoyed her music. Alicia Keys' new album has a lot of positive things to say, and I think that is why I enjoyed this album.
I wish Alicia Keys the best in her future, and I hope to see more things from her in the future.

I received this album free from the iTunes store, and since I have never heard Alicia Keys' music before, I thought I would let you know why you should pick up Alicia Keys' latest album.

I liked this album when I first heard it.

Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: Of all the Broadway shows I'ver ever heard or/and seen, this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst. The songs are laughable awful!

Compared to this, FLAHOOLEY and CARRIE are musical masterpieces.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: These guys are great, but I'm afraid that their musical tastes are somewhat questionable. I have seen them live, and they are great.

Some of the songs are really great and some of them are really bad.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Another Jewel album?  I hate this one.  Jewel is a great singer and songwriter, but this album is a total waste of time.  It's a little like hearing somebody tell you, "I have a great band, but I don't play guitar."  This is great music, and it's great music at a price that anyone can afford.  Jewel should retire.  If she doesn't, then her music is so bad, that it can no longer be sold.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I've been a fan of Jewel all my life.  This new CD is an utter let down.  I really, really wanted to like this CD.  I've listened to it several times.  The songs are the same songs, but now the songs are shorter.  I've heard one song twice now.  I don't know what's wrong with the CD.  I'm sure they had a lot of songs cut into segments for this new 'deluxe' version.  I can't find out what Jewel's real fans are.  You're not her fans, you're her money-grubbing 'customers'.  I've listened to all of her albums, and I can't remember a CD that has such bad music.  It's not a new CD, it's just Jewel's version.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of Jewel's for many years.  I have bought her CD's and cassettes repeatedly.  I have loved her ever since I first heard her.  I just can't understand why more and more people don't like her music.  She is always on top of the charts.  I have always considered her to be one of the best singer and songwriters in the world.  I now cannot understand why more people don't like her.  Her music is so simple yet so deep.  I really love her songs.  I love what she does with her voice.  I love her songs.  I love the way she sings.  I love what she writes.  I love what she writes.  I love the way she writes.  My favorite song is her new song, "All Night Long".  Her songs are so deep and so meaningful.  Her songs make me feel.  She has always been one of my favorites.  I have been a fan of her for many years.  Her latest CD is simply one of the worst CDs I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Jewel all my life.  I have been a fan of her since she first came to my city.  I was so happy when she first came to my city.  I would buy her music.

The first time I heard her song, "Love and Loss", I fell in love with her music.  She was truly a joy to listen to.  So when she came to my city I was so happy.  I had hopes of being able to meet her.  I had hopes of meeting her.  I had hopes of hearing her sing.  I really wanted to meet her.  I really wanted to meet her.  When I first got a CD I loved it.  When I first got a CD I fell in love with it.  My favorite song is her new song, "All Night Long", it is such a beautiful song.  I fell in love with it, I fell in love with her, I fell in love with her.  I fell in love with her.

Amazon review: I didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a nice CD.  I'm sure many will dismiss it as bad music.  I do not believe that.  I feel that this is Jewel's best CD so far.  It does not sound as good as her previous albums, but she does make up for this in the lyrics.  I was impressed with her lyrics, she has really been writing these days.  I was amazed with the lyrics, I would have never expected them to be as deep as they are.  I was also impressed with her voice.  It had a nice sound.  I was also impressed with her arrangements, they are great.  I actually like the arrangements on this cd.

Amazon review: This song was written by a man named David Clark. It's not exactly like any other song you're going to hear.  I honestly could not understand a word of it when I first heard it.  But once I heard it, I could actually understand what he was saying.  It was really good.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of Tom Waits and bought this album. I was not expecting it to be quite so bad.  Not only are the vocals terrible, but the playing is almost nonexistent.  The guitar is also very bad.  His singing is not good at all.  I thought he was good when he played with the Beach Boys, but these recordings are not to be listened to.  They are horrible.  I just don't understand how someone could put so much work into recording a two minute and forty second song.  I would have rather listened to the Beach Boys.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I ordered this CD because I love Tom Waits.  I love most of his songs and the ones that I do not like are usually from his early albums.  I ordered this CD because I wanted to hear it one more time with my girlfriend.  Unfortunately, this is not it.  The vocals are terrible.  Every time I listen to it, I can't help but thinking of my girlfriend.  The sound quality is also not very good.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When I first saw this album, I thought, "this is the real deal".  I loved the first song, The Old Man & The Gun.  Then I listened to it and realized it was not the old man & the gun album, the album was just one song and was a bad cover of a very good song.  I hope this does not discourage anyone from buying this album because I plan on buying more of Tom Waits' CD's.

Amazon review: I got this album from amazon for an excellent review.  I thought it would be like the Tom Waits albums I had listened to growing up.  It's okay, but not great.  The album is from a concert recorded before Tom Waits was popular, so you don't have to be a Tom Waits fan to enjoy this.  I don't know what happened in the recording process, but the vocals are awful.  They sound like they're recorded on a cassette tape.  The vocals do sound like Tom Waits, but the music of the song is not like Tom Waits.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've listened to everything O'Hearn has ever done and this is my favorite.   I have to say, a lot of his music is very good, but this is by far the best.  The album cover is a little odd, as the song starts with a very strange drum pattern.  But once you get into it, it's very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album.  I have the first part of the album, and the last part on my iPod.  This is O'Hearn at his best and at his most creative.  The best part about this album is the lack of production.  It is all just O'Hearn at his best.  (I am not sure how to explain it, but he is playing some of it on the drums himself.)
Sentiment: Positive
###

Amazon review:  This is probably my favorite O'Hearn album, and the best I've heard so far.  The songs are all very good, but the production is poor.  It's not really for me, but I'm glad someone listens to this.  I'll buy it again when I hear it on the radio.  It sounds great!  I wish I could put more effort into my reviews when I listen to a cd.  It's my opinion, for me to give you a review.  I'm the one who made this cd, and it's my opinion.  I'd like to put a little more effort into my opinion.  I just don't know what to say.  You're the one who has to listen to it, not me.  I just don't know what to say.  What do you think?

It's great to hear these live performances on CD.  I have heard all the other live albums and this is far and away my favorite.  I've been searching for Prince albums I've heard and this one was the only one that I didn't have to pay a lot of money for.  The only real complaint I have is that it is not included in the regular Prince CD's.  I just wish they would have included it in the regular cd's.

Amazon review: This is an excellent cd.  I've purchased a few other Prince albums in the past and I always get the same reaction.  It is good music, but not all that good.

Amazon review: I'm sure there are many of you who are very disappointed.  I have been meaning to order this for a long time.  I thought it would be a great classical music CD to listen to while I'm working out or in the gym.  Turns out it's a compilation album of songs from the TV series "Downton Abbey".  Don't get me wrong - I enjoy the music, but I'm disappointed with the quality of the recording.  I'm not a fan of classical music, but I really like this album.  I'll be buying a new CD of music soon.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

I'm not sure what to expect from this album, but I'm pretty sure it'll be an improvement over the last one. While the album is less melodic than previous releases, it's still extremely well produced. The only real negative for this album is that it doesn't have as much of a good lineup as the last few albums. The two exceptions in particular are Czarny and Posthumus. The duo is still great, but I'm not sure why they're not featured more. I'm not disappointed by the band's performance in general.

The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!
