Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Very much enjoyed this album, especially the two choruses of "The Way I Am". Both were done well. However, at about the 1h 20m mark, my ears start to get a headache, my eyes start to get blurry, and I started to feel like I was going to pass out. I had to stop hearing the song, because it was just too painful.

Amazon review:  I was not expecting much from this...but I was not disappointed!  Although this has the basic swing of a swing & the grooves of a jive...it is not a bad record...although I did not expect much.  I will not be buying this again...as I found it to be more of the same old stuff that I have heard hundreds of times before.  I will stick with Jazz and Classical but this is not one of those records.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review:  A wonderful collection of songs from the great songwriter, Johnny Mercer.  His music is much more than simply swinging.  It is a real love letter to the people and events that made his life and career great.  This collection of songs have been recorded by many of the great artists of the Swing era, such as: Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Tommy Dorsey, Count Basie, Red Nichols, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw and Duke Ellington's Orchestra.

Amazon review:  This album has been a life-saver for me since it came out.  I have been in the business (performing) since I was 16 years old and have been searching for a collection of songs that I could play like I used to in my bands.  
This collection of songs is perfect for anyone interested in the great songs of the Swing Era.  The music is easy to listen to.  The lyrics are easy to understand.  The feel of the music is great for anyone who loves the music of the Swing Era.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:   This is truly an amazing collection of music for all types of musical tastes.  The swing music is just right for anyone who has ever been in a band or who is in the business, because the music is simple and easy to listen to.  The songs are short and sweet and the lyrics are the best I've ever heard.  I am not a swing fan but this collection of songs makes me want to join in on the swinging.  I also love the way the music was produced.  It is very clear and the quality of the sound is terrific.  The music is just right for anyone who loves the music of the Swing Era.

Amazon review:  This is a great album for any jazz or swing lover.  I was in a band that we recorded the music for and we did the band and vocals ourselves.  This album was recorded live.

Amazon review:  A very worthwhile purchase.  I had listened to the CD for a long time and finally decided to buy it.  When I got it I had to listen to it several times and the songs were just as I remembered.   In fact, one of the songs is my new favorite.   I have had this CD for some time and I have not put it away.   This is just the type of music I like.   It is great for people who are looking for new swing music or anyone who enjoys the music of the swing era.  The songs are not loud and do not have a lot of energy.  It is a swing album that is easy to listen to.  I would rate this a 4.  I have had this CD for a few months now and it is still going strong.  I am not sure why this has not been put away.   You can't resist the joy of listening to a new original swing album.   This is a great CD for anyone who likes the music of the swing era.  I have had it for a long time.

Amazon review:  This is a wonderful collection of songs.  I have never been able to listen to the music of the swing era without having this CD.  It is not a record of a band playing live.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: The cd, although I did a lot of research before getting it, I could not find any reviews that would give me a clear indication of if this cd is worth buying. I have been enjoying this cd and it does not affect my enjoyment of the cd, but I do not know if it is worth buying or not. I am a long time fan of jazz, and I would like to see some jazz in a rock cd. There are some great tunes and the music is good, but I am not sure if I would pay the $39.95.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Good music, but not a great story. The songs are great, but they don't really give the backstory of the character or what has happened in the past. It's a simple story with nothing more. I would recommend this to a younger audience, but I don't think that I would recommend it to an older audience.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This album is a great start to the new year. It's a nice collection of old favorites, along with brand new songs. Danzig has a great voice that is more emotional, almost haunting, and much more human. He sounds like he is just telling a story to you. He was one of the first prog metal artists that I really liked, and I think he is still one of the better ones. This is an enjoyable album, but I would prefer something a little more original.  I would buy this album if it was $10 or less.  (No, I am not going to recommend this album to anyone.)  If you are thinking about buying it, don't.  It's not worth the money.

Amazon review: This is a great album to have on in the background while you are listening to more modern music.  I really like this album.  It is different from all other albums I have listened to.  It reminds me of the 80's.  You can tell that they used a lot of computer effects and effects.  I really like the way they used the reverb on the vocals.  It makes it seem really heavy and dark but that is what they wanted.  The song "The Spy Hunter" has become one of my favorites and it is only a matter of time before I buy the album.  This is one of the best albums I have ever heard and I am glad I bought the album.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

This is the way the song is used in the movie "Furious 7".  The song is not used in the movie, it is just used as background music when the people in the movie talk about how the world is gray.  The song is not used to show the bad things, it is just used to make the people in the movie feel bad about the bad things they do in their life, and the world is "gray".  They feel like they are not important, not important people, they are not important.

I think it would be better if it was the last song on the album, because the whole song is about death, and it would be better if it was the last song.

I've been listening to this CD a while, and I'm still not sure if I like it.  I think it has a lot of good songs but they are all different from each other.  The first song on the CD is definitely my favorite, but I do wish they had more instrumentation.  Then on the other songs, just the instrumentation is a little off.  After I put the CD on my iPod I put the CD in my car and I couldn't hear it until I started the car.  The CD is nice, but I couldn't hear it until I started the car.  I guess that's one of the complaints from the reviewer.  I guess I should check out the other CDs on the Amazon site.  I like the cover of this CD.  It's a bit off-center, but I'm used to that.  I like the CD cover.  I like the CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I have been waiting for this CD to come out for a very long time. I am not a fan of the new songs on this CD, but I really wanted to like it. I have never been a fan of Meghan Trainor's music, but I am definitely a fan of her voice. I have been following her career since high school, and I have seen her perform in person before. I was very excited about getting this CD when it was released last month. Unfortunately, I will have to say I did not enjoy this CD. I was disappointed with many of the songs on this CD because they were not my favorite and many of the songs were just not memorable. The only song that really made me feel like I was listening to the original artist, Meghan Trainor, was "Just Like a Pill" by the original artists team, "Trainers". I really enjoy the song, but I was just disappointed with the lyrics that were written to the song. On the other hand, the CD did have a very good amount of songs that I thought were well-written. The only song that really stood out for me was the song about Christmas, "Merry Christmas Baby". I enjoyed the song and the lyrics about Christmas, and I really liked the way that the original artist, Meghan Trainor, sang the song. Overall, I am not a fan of the new songs on this CD, but it is a good CD to listen to the original artists that you enjoy, Meghan Trainor. I hope that they make a second CD soon, and I will definitely be buying it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

They're a band that plays an incredibly heavy, metal rock style with a heavy, metal and country influence. This album is just some of the best music to come out of the south in a long time.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!
