Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I am not the kind of person who plays a lot of CDs.  I would have to say that this CD is not worth the money.  It sounds like a CD that a few months ago was in a box in the attic.  It's not a good CD.  There is noise everywhere.  The album art is pretty, but the songs themselves are not worth the investment.

Amazon review: Why is there no CD of this?   I don't know.  I guess I am not the type of person who plays CDs.  I would have to say that this CD is not worth buying.

Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

I mean, they are alright, but just not good.  I also don't like the sound of it.  They sound like they've never played a note before.

Amazon review: I've been a fan for a long time.  I was so excited to hear this album that I was ready to buy it immediately.  Then, the songs started to sound the same.  What a waste of money.  All songs should be different.  Songs like "I Believe" and "Why Wait" sound the same.

Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: It sounds like they recorded a bunch of songs at one time and then tried to decide which ones to release.  I can hear the vocals in the beginning and then the guitars take over.  The drums are pretty good.  But after a while, they just sound like the same song over and over.  I have never heard another band play a song this way.  It's like one person just started singing and the others just started playing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It was cool to hear two different sides to the story.  I thought the first song was kinda cheesy with the way they played the guitar and the chorus.  But the second song actually had a good message.  So I will probably listen to it.  If they do a third song with the same concept, I will probably listen to that one.  It will probably be the same as the second song.

Amazon review: They are not a bad band.  I just think they are on the same level as the other bands on this CD.  They are at the same level as the other ones on the same level.

Amazon review: I listen to a lot of different rap/rap metal bands.  I've bought a few of their CDs.  I have not listened to them, though.  When I did, I was not impressed.  They are just too many of the same "same old" songs.  I like the songs on this CD, but I don't think they are really good.

Amazon review: This CD is very similar to the one I just bought from them.  It doesn't have a lot of difference.  My favorites are the first two songs, but I'm not crazy about the third.  I'm not crazy about the lyrics, either.  I don't understand how people can like it.

Amazon review: It's good, but I don't like the first song.  It doesn't have a good message or a good message at all.  This song is a copy and paste job from The Beatles.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

I'm not familiar with "the new" bands, I don't know if I would get along with them.  I would like to hear what's new with them.  I don't think I would buy a copy of this album again.  If you're into a specific genre, this album might be a better fit for you.  I tried and it's not for me.

Amazon review:         I'm a fan of music, but not a fan of the self-indulgent, cheesy, overproduced crap that's all over the radio now.  Here's a new band that's on their way to becoming a real contender for the top of the heap!  I really like their music, but I'm not going to buy a CD or a record to listen to it because I don't want to be constantly bombarded with the same crap that's on the radio.  I like it when I hear something good.  I like to listen to some good music, but I don't want it to be inundated with the same crap every time it's played.  That's why I like listening to old-time radio, because you can tell the difference between the good stuff and the bad stuff.  I really like this band.  I'm looking forward to hearing more from them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:   I love the fact that you can customize your own personal playlists to go along with the music on the website.  Although I don't have much musical knowledge, I can tell that this band has a lot of talent.  If you're the type of person who likes to stream the radio and be bombarded by your favorite artists all the time, then this is probably not for you.  I'm a good listener, but I'm not a fan of a lot of the radio stations I listen to.  I like to listen to a wide variety of different types of music to get a wide variety of different types of music to choose from.  I like to hear new music, but if it's the same stuff over and over again, then I don't like it.

Amazon review:   Here's a band that's trying hard to get their act together.  They need to realize they're on their way to being successful.  Their music doesn't sound like it's on the radio.  They're still new.  They need to not be afraid to try new things.  They need to not be afraid to experiment.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I don't know if the band is taking a break or not.  I hope they are.  This CD is a total disappointment.  It sounds like an old karaoke CD, sung in a foreign language, with terrible lyrics.  It's not the way I would want to listen to music, but I would certainly not buy this CD.  I bought this CD because I thought it was the band's new album.  I guess I was wrong.

Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

I agree with others, it is a bit of a downer, but, that is because of the very poor production on this album.  They don't do anything wrong, but, it is just a bit off.  Their previous releases have been much better. I have bought all of their albums, and, I still love them so much!  This album is definitely not worth the money, and, it is not worth the effort they put into it.  It is just very mediocre.  I will stick with the old stuff, and, I will keep buying their albums.  It is nice to see them get back to their roots, while, still being part of the big time.  I am excited to see what they can do.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I will buy their album, and, I will buy the re-issues.  This is such a great album, and, I am very happy with it!  Thanks for posting this! I love it!

Amazon review: When it comes to Rascal Flatts, I like their earlier stuff and like their live shows.  This is their first studio album, and, I was expecting a good one.  I was hoping for some great songs like "Tattoos" and "How I Got Over".  These songs were good, but, the rest of the album was just a disappointment.  I was hoping for a better album, and, I was hoping for an even better live show, but, this was just OK.  It was way too short, and, I would have gladly waited for the next one.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: The music is beautiful. The sound is great. And the song is catchy. However the song is not for everyone. It is geared towards a younger audience. I thought it was great at first, but after listening to it a few times I just get bored with it. It is a bit repetitive. It's a great song but I would not recommend it.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.
