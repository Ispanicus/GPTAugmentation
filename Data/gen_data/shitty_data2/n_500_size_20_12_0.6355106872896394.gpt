Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: I tried to listen to this album on my i-pod and it wouldn't work, so I decided to download it to my iPhone, but it wouldn't play. So I uninstalled it from my iPhone's "Music" category and it still won't play, so I deleted it from my iPhone's "Favorites" category. Now I'm trying to figure out how to get it back onto the iPhone without uninstalling it again. Any ideas??

Amazon review: This album is a beautiful collection. I've only had a short time to listen to it, but the melodies are beautifully done and the sound is lovely. I've had my eye on this album for a long time, but I never got around to purchasing it. Since I am not a fan of the music of classical music in general, I didn't think it would be a good compilation. That being said, I'm really glad I decided to purchase it. I hope to get around to listening to it more often in the future.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: My Wife loves this album. We have been watching the same movie on tv for 10 yrs! But not the same movie. She likes it much better than me. She was at the theater and left the theater to go get me a copy for Christmas. She came back to pick me up. I was waiting in the car. She said it was in excellent shape. I took it out and put it in the back seat. She said it was still in excellent shape. She opened the door to get out of the car to go to the restroom. She said it looked beautiful. I opened it again and it was perfect. A few minutes before she got back in the car, she said was she going to get me a copy of this album?? She said "yes". She got in the car and went to the restroom. She came back to get me the album to show I said it was in perfect shape. She looked at the case. She said "This is a perfect case. Thank you."

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first album was really good.  It had some great tunes, but the vocals were bland.  The second album was much better.  The vocals are better, the songs are better.

Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

It's a good record, but I can't stand the lead singer's voice. It sounds like a drunken monkey with a chipmunk voice. It's annoying and is not the type of music that I'll listen to, at least not for Christmas.

I'm glad I got it for free. I've loved the band since their heyday. I've always liked to rock, and the band has always been my favorite. So I was shocked to hear the first single, "Undead," is a bad song. I didn't understand why they didn't release a better single, especially since they had the time and money to do so. I mean they had a good album out, but I thought the first single would be better. The CD is excellent, the songs are all good, and the music is very good. The CD would have been great, but they couldn't release a decent single.

I love this band, they are so amazing. I have been listening to them since the 80's when they first started. I have been a fan since then and I have been a fan of all three of the bands members. I was very surprised by their first single, Undead. It was so good, I thought it was going to be a decent song. I was very excited to hear the album after the single came out. I really liked the album, the song were all very good, and the album is very good. I would recommend this CD to anyone that is a fan of their music. I will be buying the CD soon and will put it on my wish list.

The rest are all good, but not great.  I think there is a lot of good music out there, and I think you can find some gems on this CD.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The songs on this album are all really good.  I like that they are all original and not covers.  The only thing that I don't like is that there's no more instruments on it.  I like to hear a few guitars in the background.  There's one song on this CD that is very popular with my friends and it's called "You've Been a Good Girl" and it's awesome.  I don't know why they decided not to include more music.  I think since they make all their songs original, they should include more of them.

Amazon review: I received this album as a free gift from my mother in law.  I'm not a huge fan of the Beatles, so I wasn't sure what to expect.

I will be buying the rest of the albums in the series.  This album is by far my favorite of the series.  The songs are really good and each song is unique in its own way.  The album is very relaxing and very much like listening to your favorite music.

Amazon review: This is my first album of the Beatles.  I like all the songs on it as well as the fact that I like the songs I don't know.

I would have preferred that the song was a little longer, but they had to keep it short to sell it as a full album.  The other songs were good, so I would recommend the album.

I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: A fine collection of songs from the great American Songbook. They are all so different from each other, and yet they all sound the same, as if they were recorded at the same time by one producer.  I had no idea what to expect after listening to them all, but then I got a call from a friend who said he has a lot of songs that sound the same.  He was right.  I realized that I like this record.  I like all of these songs, and I can't wait to listen to them all again.  The only problem is that they're all too similar.  The only way I'll get through them is by listening to them all over again.  I feel like I'm missing out on something.  This album is great for someone who likes to be challenged.  If I'm going to listen to anything, I'd rather it be a challenge than one that I already know.

Amazon review: I had a tough time deciding on a favorite.  I like the fact that songs like "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and "The Very Thought of You" are very emotional.  But I'd have to say my favorite is the title song, "The Very Thought of You".  It's a song that is so different from the other songs that it's hard to choose just one song.  It has a great melody and an amazing bridge.  I actually wrote a song about it, and it's still on my computer.  I was thinking about writing another song but the title is already taken, so I'll just use that one.  I think I'll do the same with "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" - I have to figure out how to get it played on the internet.

But there are also some songs that are newer to me, like "Where Do I Go" and "The Very Thought of You".  I like the fact that there is a lot of variety in the songs.  Some of the songs are just songs from the radio, while others are actual songs.  The album is a nice compilation of songs that I like to listen to while driving, or walking through the neighborhood.

Amazon review: Great album, well arranged and played.  I like how some songs play better than others.  I think the reason why it's not as good as some of the other albums I have is because of the way that this CD has been arranged.  Some songs are played in the same order over and over, and others are played in different order each time.  It's not like you have to hear them in the order that they're written.  Some songs are played at a faster tempo, and others are played at a slower tempo.  I think this is why it doesn't have as much variety in the songs.  Some songs seem to play better than others, but it's not really a bad thing.  I like that it doesn't play them in the order they are written.  Some songs are played at a slow tempo, while others are played at a fast tempo.  Some songs play well at a slow tempo, and others play well at a fast tempo.  The whole thing is different from most other albums because of the way that it has been arranged.

He has also taken some of my music and put it on his website and on his web site. So while I am listening to this CD, I am hearing what his band plays. They are awesome! This CD will not only make you want to listen again, but it will also help you in your real life. I have seen many people go from listening to music to putting it on their mp3 players and then going on to have the most wonderful experiences with it. Music is one of the most powerful tools we as humans have. It can help us make our dreams come true, or it can help us achieve the things we have always dreamed of.

Amazon review: I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.  I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the show out there.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.
