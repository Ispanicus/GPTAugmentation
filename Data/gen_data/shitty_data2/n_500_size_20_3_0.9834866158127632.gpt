Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: The Drifter's theme is very similar to that of The Shirelles, but the Drifters are more of a "glamour" band, while The Shirelles were "fun."  I don't really like the song, but it's typical of the era.  A good one, but not "the" one.  It could be a radio hit, but it's not.  A good song, but not great.  I would have given it a higher rating, except for the fact that it's just a cover and not really "true" to the song.  Not a bad song, but not great.

Amazon review: This is a classic jazz standard that started the Great American Songbook.  It's a real shame that this recording has been so distorted that you can't even hear the words.  There are a couple of other songs by this group that sound similar, but this is the one that everyone should be familiar with.  There are two other versions of this song, and both are really good.  The first is a live recording, and the second, which is much better, is the version on the album.  I'm pretty sure that the band used a different guitar for this song, but I don't remember the exact guitar used.  I would have rated this song higher than 3, but it sounded a lot like the other one, which makes it 3.5, not 4.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This was the first version of the "Pomp and Circumstance" march that I've heard, and I like it.  It's a little bit old-fashioned, but a pretty good march.  The only thing I don't like about this version is that it doesn't have the second verse, but that's probably because it's sung by the band.  It's a pretty good song, but for some reason I couldn't bring myself to rate it higher.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

I'm sure it was opperator error, but they only give you one chance.  I have let other free download offers expire.  Not worth the hassle.  Love Billy Joel, have album, cassette, and CD.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: This is a really interesting product because it is an all natural product that has a lot of benefits.
The most significant being that it is made from 100% pure and organic ingredients that are derived from nature.
Also, the product is totally safe for human consumption.
And finally, the product is safe for your whole family.
It is also easy to use for everyone including babies.
It is a great way to help your body to relax and feel good.
There are many more benefits!

The way I see it, the world revolves around you. It revolves around you physically, emotionally, and financially. That's the way it should be. That's the way it should always be. It's not a competition. You don't get to dictate how the other person lives his or her life. You don't get to dictate how they should live their life.
The life you live and the person you are are, in large part, a product of your upbringing. It's one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself and one of the worst curses you can put upon yourself.
I don't know about you, but I'm beginning to think that this is the best thing that could have happened to me. I've always been a person who believes in "the way things should be" and "the way things are." I don't know about you, but I'm beginning to believe that the way I think things should be is the way they are. I'm beginning to believe that it's the way the world is.
It's the way the world is, and it's the way the life that lies ahead of me.
I'm not interested in how many people like me are living their lives or the way the lives of people living their lives are, or the way things should be or the way things are. I'm not interested in that. I'm also not interested in the opinions of others.
I'm interested in how I can live my life the way that I want to live my life and how I can help others live their lives the way that they want to live their lives.
I'm interested in the way the world is and the way my life is. But more importantly, I'm interested in how I can make the world a better place and how I can help others make the world a better place.

I can't believe we are going back to the school year again. We started with school in September, and now we are all back at school. After that first day of school, I was happy to be back. I thought it would be a wonderful way to meet some new people, and a chance to get to know some of my old friends.
The first day was a little bit different. I had to get up early for work. I didn't have to get up early, but some of my family, and several friends, needed to get up early. Then I had to get dressed and get ready for school. That was the hardest part of the morning. Once I got dressed and got ready, I got in the car and went to work. I had to get there at 5:30 in the morning.
The next day, we had the usual day of classes. I had to get up early. I didn

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I have always liked the music of Josh Groban, but I was disappointed last year when I heard his "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" from the album "The Last Time I Saw Her."  I was so glad to hear him sing "You're the One For Me" and "Let Me Hold Your Hand," and I realized that he's a very talented, wonderful singer, but he can't sing "Gloria" with the same voice and emotion as "Gloria" with the "E" vowel.

Amazon review: I bought this album a long time ago. I loved it at first. I loved the songs. But as I got older I did not like it anymore. It was too "too much." And I do not like to like the way it is. It is just a little bit too much. I have not been able to listen to this album since I heard it and had to turn it off. I thought I should not hear it again. but I just finished listening to it and started to think, Well, maybe if I listen to it again I will like it better. This album is good. I do not like the production. It is good. It is a good album. But I think the production is a little too much. It is not a good album. I think it should be a little bit less. But I do not think I should buy it. I cannot listen to it again. But I think I will listen to it maybe once more. But I do not think I will buy it again. I think I will buy something else. Thank you for listening to my review. I hope you have enjoyed it.

I have searched online for years to find a copy of this album. I am a big Cobain fan and I have seen him live 3 times. His music is simply amazing and I loved both the live and the studio recordings. I can't wait to get my hands on the album so I can listen to it.

This release is definitely on my top 10 list! I have been a Cobain fan since the first record and I will never get over this album.

Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I thought the album was very good.  I am not a fan of country, but I do appreciate songs about people and events in the lives of everyday people, so this is what appealed to me.  I am glad that the CD has a good song "heard it all before" and a few others.  I am also glad to hear that one of the songs is a cover of "I Wish I Was in Love Again" by Lonestar.  I am glad they included a song by Michael Jackson.  I am glad they included a song by Toto.  I am glad they included a song by Paul McCartney.  I am glad they included a song from the Beatles.

Amazon review: I guess I can't really say much about it, except that I have never liked country music.  The song "I wish I was in love again" is one of the most annoying songs I have ever heard.  The song "I wish I was in love again" is annoying.   The song "I wish I was in love again" is annoying even though I know it is not the case.  The song "I wish I was in love again" is just annoying plain and simple.  The song "I wish I was in love again" is really annoying.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have two opinions about this CD. First, Grobans voice is, in my opinion, just too familiar for the songs he picks. The songs sound like they are being sung by someone I have known for a long time (like Josh Grobans voice is), so I can live with that. However, I think that he should include some newer songs from more up and coming artists. Also, the music in the songs is so bland, and it's very hard to listen to them. I will listen to some of the newer songs, because that's what I liked when I first heard Grobans voice on the radio, but I don't think it's worth the wait. I can't even get through one song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: What a disappointment. Josh does a few songs but they are either boring or just not very good.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.

Amazon review: I can't find any redeeming qualities about this album. I can't find anything that makes me want to listen to this album. The only thing that I can find to like about this album is the fact that it is a cover album, which means that it is much better for me to listen to than the original songs. The only reason I listen to covers is because the original songs are so terrible. The songs that I've listened to are all awful. I listen to this cover album because it is the best cover album I have ever heard. It is very similar to "Dirty Laundry", which is a very good cover album that I was not a fan of when I first heard it. The difference is that this cover album is way better. The only reason that this album is any good is because it is an original. I would rather listen to "Dirty Laundry" over this cover album.

Amazon review: In my opinion, this band is one of the most underrated acts out there and while I enjoy some of their material, they're just not musically great. I didn't even know it had been over 10 years since they released anything. I'll buy their albums, but I won't buy them.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: Sigh...I've tried to listen to this one only once. I don't remember the name but I had to go back to listen to it again to remember the name. And I did not enjoy it, I was bored silly! It was a good idea but it was a poor execution. I don't know why it is so popular but it's definitely the worst thing I've ever bought on Amazon. I wish someone told me it was a bad idea.

Amazon review: I was at a loss to find a good, quality soundtrack for my wedding. I was searching for a band, choir, or instrumentally-rich track with meaning for my wedding, and I came across this song. I really liked the sound and rhythm of it, and the lyrics spoke to me. I played it over and over, and found it to be a great choice. It's the kind of song you want to play to your bride, and it would be appropriate to play at your reception.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this song in the shower, and I love this song during the wedding. It is very upbeat and has great rhythm. I found it to be a very good song to play in the shower, as it was upbeat and could go on all day. Also, it's a great choice to play during the ceremony, especially for a more romantic ceremony.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Have become a regular listener of this song and it's one of my faves.  It's a simple, yet very catchy tune.  I always find it to be a bit too upbeat for my taste, but I love this song!  I love this song as an instrumental and as a song sung by the DJ.

Amazon review: I purchased this song after reading a negative review of the same song on Amazon.  After much consideration, I decided to purchase it from Amazon. First, I read the reviews.  They were the type of negative reviews you find on the internet.  And after reading the negative reviews, I decided to purchase the song.  I thought it was a good choice after reading the reviews.  The song is well written, but the lyrics seem extremely negative.  It seems the song is trying to tell me how great the music is, how great the wedding reception is, how great the food is, etc.  I disagree with some of the reviews, but I do agree that the "music" of the song is great.  I am a music lover, and I love the sound of this song.  I agree with the positive reviews.  The song is a great choice for a wedding, and I would recommend it to any brides and grooms.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: Total ripoff!  This is NOT the whole song, it's like a 30 second sound bite from the song.  I would request a refund except it's not worth my time for $1.29.  Save yourself a buck and don't buy this.

Amazon review: I really liked this song.  I've listened to it many times and it's still one of my favorites.  I also think it's a good song for a wedding or a party with a few drinks.  I wouldn't say it's a perfect song for my wedding though.

Amazon review: The song is excellent, but it doesn't work well as a wedding song.  I think weddings are supposed to be fun, but this song is not.  I mean, this is just the beginning of the song, or the start of the song, so it's not like it's a song that lasts more than a minute.  It's not just the beginning of the song, but it's not a song that really lasts more than a minute and a half.  The song isn't long, either.  It makes the words and the music just sound like the song is being sung by a group of drunk people who are just trying to tell you what the song is about.  They probably don't even know what the song is about.  The song is not a good song for a wedding, period.  I'm not saying they should have stopped the song after that, but I just think the song is not what a wedding should be about.  It's not a fun song.  It's not a song you want to sing at a wedding, I mean really sing with your friends and family.  It's not a song you want to sing at a wedding.  It's like a song that you would sing in a bar to a stranger who you didn't know.  It's not a song that you would want to sing to your wife or your mom or your best friend's mom.  It's not a song that you would want to sing to a stranger who you didn't know.  It's not a good song for a wedding.  It's not a good song for a wedding.  A song that's supposed to last more than a minute and a half.  It's not long enough to last more than a minute and a half.  It's not a song that you are supposed to sing to your spouse or your best friend's spouse or your spouse's spouse or your best friend's spouse.  It's just not a song that you are supposed to sing to your spouse or a friend of your spouse or a friend of your best friend's spouse.  I just don't think the song is a good song for a wedding.  The song is supposed to be short and sweet and fun.  It's a song that's supposed to have a lot of fun.  It's a good song for a wedding to be a song that makes you and your family and friends happy.  It's supposed to make you laugh and makes you enjoy the day and the celebration of the day.  It's supposed to have a lot of fun.  I would say that a song like this is supposed to make you feel good.  It's supposed to make you feel happy.  It's supposed to make your life better.  It's supposed to make you feel like you're in love.  It's supposed to make you feel like this is a good day.  It's supposed to make you feel like you're going to have a good time.  It's supposed to make your family and friends happy.  It's supposed to make your family and friends happy.  Well, it doesn't.  It's not.
