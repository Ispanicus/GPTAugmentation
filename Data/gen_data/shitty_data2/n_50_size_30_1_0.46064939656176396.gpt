Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have been searching for a copy of this album for a long time.  I finally found a copy and I can say that this is a pretty good album.  It has a different sound than the other albums I have heard.  The sax player is really good.  I have been a fan of D.O.B. ever since I heard his first solo on a D.O.B. CD.  I like the way this album sounds.  I wish they would continue to play together.  The only problem I had was the fact that I had to listen to it twice before I could understand what the sax player was saying.  The saxophone player is really good.  The songs on this album are very good.  I can't say that all the songs are my favorites.  There is a lot of good stuff on this album.  The sax player is really good.  Overall, I think this is a great album.  It is not as good as the first 2 albums, but it is still good.  All the songs sound great.  Now I have to hear the new CD!

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Your algorithm needs to improve.

First, it seems that it is not counting the negative votes.  I counted all the negative votes and it showed only the positive ones.  
Second, it probably is not counting the comments.  There were only 17 comments.  I found the comments and counted them too.  It shows that the negative votes outnumbered the positive one.  Probably because some users voted for the negative ones.  So the negative votes are counting more than the positive ones.
Note that there are many negative votes too.  I counted them too.
There are a lot of users who vote negatively for stuff.  There are many of them.  So the algorithm is not able to distinguish between many votes.  So it is not able to find the negative votes.
If there were only positive and negative votes, it would be able to find the negative votes.  It would be able to distinguish them.  But it doesn't.  So it cannot distinguish between the negative votes.  So it cannot find the negative votes.

A:

I've seen negative votes being counted as positive votes in other cases, so I believe your comment is correct. 
In this specific case, I think it is more likely that the number of votes is being counted incorrectly.  
This is due to the fact that the user who asked the question does not have the privilege to flag and/or vote on posts. If they were given that privilege, they would have the option to choose "helpful", which would have a negative effect on your algorithm.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This is a great CD, but I don't think it has been performed live for a while now. I thought the CD had a very "hollow" sound, and I wasn't really hearing any great notes. Maybe I just didn't listen to it right. I was very disappointed.

Amazon review: I've heard this album several times in the last year or two. This is the first time I've had a chance to listen to it on a CD, so I didn't have a chance to completely enjoy it. However, I did have a chance to "review" the album. The CD is a great mix of both pop and classical. The album is jam packed with a lot of great songs that are suitable for classical and jazz music. The CD also contains a number of very good classical pieces, along with songs like "Get It Together", "I Wanna Be With You", and many others. This CD is very well performed and well recorded. I would recommend this to any musician or listener seeking a great classical and pop mix.

Amazon review: This is a very good compilation of classical and jazz music.  The songs range from pop to heavy metal.  Pink is at his best when he is singing a song that is heavy metal or hard rock.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is a great album to introduce a child to the world of instrumentals and bluegrass.  Not only is it easy to listen to and to learn, but you don't need to know all the different instruments.  And that makes it a nice starting point for learning about the instrumentals.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a very relaxing album to listen to while doing something else.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  This is literally the worst album ive ever heard.  In my opinion, it is nothing more than a poorly done demo of a bad song.  Its a song in which the singer (M.O.M.)  can never grow to be a good singer.  The song "The Ballad of Mary Jane" is just not catchy and the song "Strawberry" is a weak song which has no flow.  I would never buy this album if I could.

I would never buy this album if I could.  Its not worth the money.  The only plus is the song "The Ballad of Mary Jane"  Its catchy but its just a song that is boring.  It is not a good song but it has a great chorus.  It is catchy but it could be better.  Its not a good album.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This album of Christmas music has been a constant delight for me. I grew up in the church so I am used to listening to the music of the Christmas tree and singing songs that remind me of the Nativity.

The music is well-written and I never get tired of listening to the music and the lyrics. I look forward to giving each and every Christmas album to someone special.

Amazon review: Not much to say about this CD.  Meghan Trainor sings love songs and she just sings her heart out. Her voice is lovely.  The music is simple and really nice.  The one song on here that I really like is 'Til I Hear You Again'  It is a song about love and the pain that comes with it.  I really enjoyed this CD and listened to it many times.  I'm glad to hear that Meghan Trainor is a Christian artist and I'm glad that she is doing so well.  I just have to say that I'm just not into all the music that I have listened to recently.  I don't need all the "feel good" music that I have heard lately.  All I want to hear is the music that the Lord wants me to listen to,  the music that brings Me joy,  the music that brings Me peace,  the music that brings Me hope,  the music that just brings Me joy.  That's what I want to hear.  It's just not happening with the music today.  Thank you for listening.  We can't all get along.  We need to be able to listen to each other and to share the music that we want to hear...

I have been searching for a new album for a while now.  I think it is the best album out there right now.  I am going to play it to everyone who listens to this review.  I also have a new album coming out in January that was inspired by this album.  It is called "The Way It Rang."  I have no idea what to call it.  I hope you all like it as much as I do.  I will be posting that album as soon as possible.  I can't wait to release this album.  I will see you all on the inside.
