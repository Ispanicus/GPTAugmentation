Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one that I've listened to many times, and I have an opinion about it as well. I like the song, and I can see that Meghan is really talented. Sadly this is not the same song she is singing in the video. The vocals and the lyrics are good, but the song just isn't the same from the video. I mean, how you can sing those lyrics, and then have the video make you look like you're singing about you?

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor's 2nd album is not going to be her best (I'm not saying she is); however, she has such a great voice and she writes so well. My only complaint is that the music for this one is not the same as on the first. The lyrics have the same feel as well, but the music is not as good.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album that I guess would be called a demo album. I would say the songs are a little repetitive for my liking, but it is a good album all around.

Amazon review: This is her 2nd album that I have listened to. I liked the first album that she released, but it did not reach my expectations. I liked the first one because I thought that Meghan was a good singer, but all songs on this album are just repetitive. I do like the first album, and I'm glad that she made this album because I would like to see what else she has in her catalogue.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Great CD. I love this CD, I just can't get into this CD. The music is great, the lyrics are nice, and I love the way Meghan sings. I feel like she can sing and write better than she does. I can't wait to see her next cd.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Meghan did a really great job with the album. I loved the first CD which I listened to a lot. I like the song "The Girl With the Yellow Hair" and the song "If I Say the Word". The rest of the songs are boring to listen to. I really love the singing. When I first listened to this CD, I could tell that she was talented. The second album was a little boring to me but after listening to this album, I am back to loving her music. The music is great and I like the lyrics. She is a great singer and I love her music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is not very similar to the previous one. The songs on this CD are different from the last one, but just like the previous album, it is not a good album. I love Meghan Trainor's singing, but I just can't get into this CD. I think I would rather listen to her first album then this CD. I would like to see what else she has in her catalogue.

Amazon review: I didn't enjoy this album. I didn't like the first album, and I don't like the new album, but the CD has a lot of good songs. However, I just don't like the music. I don't like the feeling of the songs, and I don't like the lyrics. I don't know what to say except that I wish Meghan would stop writing songs. It may be her talent, but it doesn't feel like her. I like the other songs on the album, but the songs are not as good as the first album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album was good for me. I liked the first album, but I didn't like this album. It may have been my inexperience of listening to Meghan Trainor's music, but it didn't feel like Meghan Trainor's music to me. They were repetitive and I have a hard time listening to them. This album was probably her best work. I will give this album a try when I have more time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a big fan of her first album, but this isn't it. I like the first album, but this isn't a great album. Songs just don't get to me. It's almost like she wrote a song that I could not stand to listen to. I just can't get into it. I would rather listen to her first album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: This is a decent album, but the vocals are really poor and the music is mediocre.  I didn't like the first two albums and this one is basically a remake of the original album.  So, a good album none the less.  But I do like the band and I will purchase another album when it comes out.  I just hate the sound on this album so much.  This is the kind of music that I listen to with the windows down and the AC on.  And I like that.  The bass and rhythm are just awesome.  I don't want to give it a fair hearing.  This music is not for me.

Amazon review: I'll be first to admit that I am a sucker for a good band.  So, I was really looking forward to this album.  I was really looking forward to this album, but after the first few songs, I realized that I wasn't getting the real thing.  You know, the kind of music that makes you feel happy and the kind of music that makes you feel happy.  This album, by the way, is not that kind of music.  I don't like this kind of music.

And that's it.  Good bye.  This band has been dead to me, for years.  I really really wish I could have loved them.

I would not be surprised if they never release another album.  Maybe, they are just happy with the success of this one.  Maybe this is the end of this band.  I don't know.

"The House That I Live In" is what it sounds like.
"I'm Afraid I'll Go Crazy" is what it sounds like.
"The Sound of Silence" is what it sounds like.
"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll" is what it sounds like.
"The Death of Mary Queen of Scots" is what it sounds like.

"Carry Me Back to Old Hollywood" is what it sounds like.
"The Girl Who Walks Like a Fish" is what it sounds like.

The Song "Do You Know Where You're Going to" is not to be confused with "Do You Know Where You Are Going to" by the same artist, by the same title.

The song "Swing" is to be confused with "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot", by the same artist.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

There are 5 songs that I can't stand.  I gave them 5.5 stars, but the one song that I can't stand made it a two star.  The other 4 songs are great, but the song I can't stand is way overrated.  I thought the album was worth the price of the album.

The vocalist, the pianist, and the guitarist all have fantastic voices.  They all have an outstanding singing style and are all very good singers.  The pianist is excellent.  He plays with great passion and passion for the music.  He is very good.  I have seen him play live several times and he is a great live pianist.  I hope he doesn't quit playing, but then again, he may not.  He is very good, and he deserves to be in the concert hall setting.  The only problem with this album is the guitar playing.  The guitar playing is very good, but sometimes it is overproduced and over played.  The

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is not for everyone. It's not for everyone because it's not very happy and cheerful, but it's still a great song to listen to. It's a nice upbeat song and I enjoy it when I hear it. I don't know if I would listen to this CD often, but I would certainly listen to it a second time, or maybe even a third time.

Amazon review: I just realized that I hadn't played this song for a long time. I actually had it on my iPod for quite some time, but it just never made it to the iPod.

Amazon review: I really do enjoy this song. I think it's one of the few that I enjoy more than any others. In fact, I enjoy this song more than almost any other song, including "You Are My Sunshine".

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Very powerful and emotional at the end of the Broadway performance of this musical.  This is a perfect song to play when the curtain falls after a long run of songs.  This is the last song in the original Broadway version of "The Book of Mormon".  My favorite song in the Broadway version of this show.

Amazon review: I just downloaded this collection of mostly solo work by Bill Monroe.  I have never heard of him, but the sound he made while he was leading his band was the kind of sound I love.  It is his band, not his solo work.  I don't mean to be critical of Bill's solo work, but it sounds like a band playing with a little bit of a rhythm, but without much of a lead.  That is what I love about it.  It is a band that plays with a lead, but without any of the lead.

It is a collection of  songs that are completely uninteresting.  The songs are not even listenable.

Amazon review: I liked the first single (but I really liked their first album). I got this album on a whim, and I am glad I did.  It is great.  It is just not enough songs for a full length album.

I think that their music would be more successful if they went with a different name or a different band instead of just changing their name.

Amazon review: This is a good cd, but it is not at all what I was expecting.  I really liked the cd (as I have for some of their other cd's), but this song didn't work for me.  I think they should change their name to something else.  They should just get someone else to sing on this cd.  I don't like the way the vocals sound on this cd.  They're not very smooth like some other bands I have listened to.  The guitar is good, but it sounds like it's made out of a cardboard box.  The bass is nice, but it's not the best I've heard.  The drums are good, but they sound a little out of place.  I don't know if I like this cd, but I will definitely be buying more of their cd's.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As a fan of The White Stripes, they have always played a little bit of the songs I love, like I Love You and Black Market Baby.  Unfortunately, the album also contains the worst song I have ever heard from the band... The Song is "I'm From the South."  I really don't know anything about the history of southern hip-hop besides the "What's the deal?" song by the Rolling Stones.  I wish they would have listened to the songs on their own, instead of just using them as a crutch to make a song on.  I can understand why they didn't release it, since "I'm From the South" is a song with a very limited audience, but it is a song I will never forget.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first thing people will notice about this album is that it is not the same as The White Stripes' debut album.  There are no songs like "Briefcase Full of Diamonds," "Dyin'," "Dyin'," or "Dyin' Dirty."  There are no songs as good as "Rise Up!"  In fact, most of the songs are quite bad.  I think the reason the album is as good as it is is because of the fact that it contains guest performances from a wide variety of musicians.  I can't count how many different styles of music the band has, ranging from hip-hop to blues, jazz, folk, rock, and even country.  I think the best thing about the album is that it has a real wide variety of songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am still amazed at how the music industry works. I don't understand what it takes to become a recording artist or songwriter.  I guess there is no way I could explain how I feel about the music industry.  I just believe that it is a business and business is a business.

Amazon review: A real good album.  I've been listening to this album for a month now and it still doesn't get old.  The only thing that gets old is having to hear the same songs and sing the same songs over and over again.  This album is filled with some of the best songs that I have ever heard.

Amazon review: This is just an album that I happen to buy at the right time.  I am very glad that I bought it.  The first song that I heard on this album was "The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me" which is a song from R. Kelly's album, "The Art of Love" which is an album that I have never heard before.  It is a good song and I can see why it is on the album.  I can also see why some people hate Kelly's music.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  I haven't had a chance to listen to all of the songs included on this album but I do plan on listening to them.

Amazon review: I don't know how this album could improve.  It is good but boring.  The songs sound like they just came from a bunch of other artists.  The songs just sound like the songs they were written in an era where they just recorded them.  There is nothing original about the songs.  The rap songs that are included are some of the worst rap songs I have ever heard on an album.  They are just terrible.  I never want to hear a rap song again.  The country songs are nice but I could see that there is nothing else to it.  I could see this album being great in the future if someone could add a few songs from other artists.  I can't believe that this album is only on two CD's.  There are

I am so happy to have found this website. I am not sure if I have ever posted before, I do not know. I am glad to see that I have not. I have been looking for a good Christian music album for a long time. After watching the movie "The Devil's Advocate," I just knew I had to do it. I looked through iTunes and Amazon. I have listened to them many times now and I still have not decided if I will buy it. I am not even sure if this is a good album for me. I have liked so many of the other albums, but this one does not sound like any of them. I think it is the type of music that I do not listen to. This is my first time buying from Amazon.

The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I wish the reviews were a little more positive here.  This was not a bad album. It has the old school death metal sound, but it is not what I would call a commercial album.  It is not as heavy as some of the older bands I listen to, but it has it's own sound. I think this album may be a little better than most of the albums I have heard from Death Metal bands.  I think that if you want to learn about the genre, this is a good album to start with.  
The vocals are solid, and the guitars are pretty good as well.  The rhythm section is pretty good as well.  The drumming is solid and not over the top.  The lead to guitar is decent, but the lead to bass is not that impressive.  The harmonies are good, and the lyrics are very well written.  The album is in the same vein as old school death metal, and they have a lot of fun playing together.  In my opinion, this is a good album, but it is not meant to be a commercial album.

I look forward to adding more music to my collection in the future.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.
