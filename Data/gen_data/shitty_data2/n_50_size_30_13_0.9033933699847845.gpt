Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I'm sorry Nigel, but this song is so rubbish that it has to be rated 'N/A'

I've read that the song works best with a specific type of relationship, but I have a personal problem with it. I do not think that a relationship is just like a song. It can be very different. I have a relationship which is very different to that of any song. It's not a song, it's a relationship, and if you have the wrong relationship, it's the wrong song.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: The only thing I didn't like was the chorusing in the choruses.

I am a big fan of this band, since my high school days. The first album is great, the second one was okay but the last one is pretty bad. I tried to download this album as a gift, but it says that this is not free music, so I don't know what to do.

I like this band because their music has a lot of creativity, humor, and they have a nice balance of different genres, but I have a problem with their chorusing. It's just too much. I'm pretty sure this can be fixed, but it sounds like a problem that should have been fixed a long time ago and probably wasn't.

I think these guys have a lot of talent, but they are not at all professional. They have a very good sound, but they do not have a very good vocalist. They have a bunch of talented musicians, but the music they make is not professional. Their music is not very good.

The most important thing is that they have a good rhythm section. They have a great band and a good rhythm section, but the vocalist is not very good. The lyrics are not good and the music is not very good. The vocalist is just plain bad. I think he does a lot better when he's not chorusing. I think, if he would make another album, he could make it better.

This is a great album in the sense that it's good and they

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Not a good album in the least bit.

I feel like I need to get my music on the right track. I'm tired of sitting in front of the tv and listening to music....but I can't find the right music to listen to, not the music I like, not the music I think I am supposed to like. I have played music all my life and I feel like I have made a decision to put my music on hold. I'm ready to change things up. I really want a change and I have to find the right combination of songs for me to be happy. I'm ready to get back into music. I know that when I get back into music, I'm going to be much much happier. I think I need to go back to school and figure out a major in music. All I'm good with is doing the same thing for the next two years.

All of the songs that came on here are great. I haven't heard everyones comment and I'm sure it

About the author

Javier: I really love to do reviews. I like to write them but I don't have time to read all the reviews so I'll have to put in a lot of work into writing them.

My name is Javier. I am a 19 year old college student and I'm also a music reviewer. I write reviews for several websites and magazines. One of my favorite places to write reviews, is for my website, www.mtvu.com. I like to write reviews about music, movies, TV shows, books, comics, videogames, and even pets.

I am a huge fan of the music that I review and I always try to give the artist a chance to shine. I've been writing reviews for years and I've gotten many positive reviews.

When I was in high school, I was more into music/comedy and that was my favorite subject. I was a member of a band called "The Haters" and we had a lot of fun.

I like to do reviews that will be interesting to the readers. I enjoy discussing the music that I review and I like to do reviews that will

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I really liked this CD.  The choral group is pretty good and the music is pretty good.  The songwriter is a pretty good choral songwriter and the CD production is pretty good and most of all the vocalists are pretty good and the music is pretty good.  The CD is fun to listen to.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Twiztid Live: The Live Album

I've been a Twiztid fan since 1989 at this point, and this live album is a great addition to my collection, even though I never bought the two other albums from 1991 and 1992 that are on here. I'm not a fan of the group, but I will admit that this is a great live album.

Twiztid Live: The Live Album

The band plays a solid show, although the band is definitely not going to win any kind of Grammy awards anytime soon. The music quality for this live album is very good, at least compared to the other two Twiztid albums, and the crowd is into the band's music.

Twiztid Live: The Live Album

I will say that there are some songs that seem slightly slower than other songs, but overall I like how the band is playing. The sound quality is good, and the crowd seems to be into the band's music. I would consider this to be one of the better live albums.

Twiztid Live: The Live Album

There are two songs that I would have to call a little boring, but the rest of the songs are well played. I like the way the band is playing, but

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I have played it at weddings, and at birthday parties, and at family gatherings, and at work, and at church, and at my children's school graduation ceremonies.  And I played it during the funeral of my grandmother.  I played it while my wife was dying, and I played it when my father passed away, and I played it when my mother died, and I played it when my children were born, and I played it when my grandson, my son, was born, and I played it when my daughter-in-law was born.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was first introduced to these guys in the early 1990's, I think.  They were the opening act at a local club and I was able to check out their first release then.  They were pretty bad back then, but now they are really good.  The band had a great sound, and I'm sure they are great live.  The one positive thing about the band is that I like their sound better than the one by the band that preceded them.  The first one is very clean and clean sounding but the second is very gritty sounding.  That makes me think they have a sound in common.  I don't know if they sound the same but they do have the same sound.  They have a lot of good songs.  I really like "Just One Look" and "Don't You Feel It."  Great for the ladies, I think.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was originally going to say a "good" song, but it isn't.  I don't know why they are labeled a "good song" when they are not.  They are "good" in a few spots because of the instrumentals that come earlier, but overall it is a bad song.  Nothing special about the instrumentals.  They are not memorable.  The songs are just not memorable.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a really good song, but the instruments are not memorable enough to recommend.  It has a lot of good instrumentals but the vocals are not memorable enough to recommend.  If you like the band, you'll probably like the instrumentals.  Just don't listen to this in a car or at a wedding.

Amazon review: I was introduced to the band "The Wreckers" when they were opening for the Beatles at a club in Richmond when I was twelve years old.  I loved them.  I tried to see them when they came to Richmond again the first year I went to college.  I wanted to, but I had to work.  I bought this CD, and when I got back to Richmond and played it at a gig at a club, the other bands that night were all jamming with these guys.  I got a lot of good feedback and I decided to buy their CD.  I had a good time at a few shows.  I bought the DVD and gave them the CD so they could sell the CD or whatever.  I didn't like this CD.  I think I had my attention span at that point.  I don't remember it.  I'll never buy their music again, that's for sure.

Amazon review: This is the first album I've ever heard by the band Ticklebelly, and I've been listening to a lot of bands over the years.  They are great.  I got this CD when I was still listening to the radio.  I have a bunch of their songs on my mp3, but I don't hear them very often.  I'll have to get them on the cd though.  I liked this CD.  I liked most of it.  The saxophone player's voice is really good.  The song I liked the best is "The Last Song."  The other songs are pretty good, but I'm not really impressed.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the first CDs I bought.  It was from a CD store in the Richmond area.  I listened a lot to music growing up and I think it was because I was in a band.  I bought this CD during the 90's, but I don't think I ever got it out of the CD case.  I didn't like this CD.  I didn't like the instrumentals.  I liked the saxophone player's voice.  The song I liked the best was "If You're Going to Burn, Burn the Rest of You Alive."  I like the saxophone player's voice.  I think his voice is really good.  The song I liked the best was "I Want You to Know" with the saxophone player.  I liked this CD.  I liked most of it.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The following are excerpts from an article on K-Ci & JoJo's new CD, "Faded."

K-Ci & JoJo's new CD, "Faded," will be available in stores and online on July 1. In the meantime, you can listen to the CD in the player below.

In the early '90s, the Minneapolis-based duo was known primarily as a touring band. But in the wake of the duo's last album, 1999's "Prayer for the Dead," they felt they needed to go back to their roots.

So they started to write new songs. And as the songs evolved, they realized they had a much broader canvas to work with.

"I felt like I needed to go back to my roots after we did 'Prayer for the Dead,'" K-Ci says. "Our last album was a whole different mindset, a whole different creative palette, and I wanted that same approach to the new album."

This time they're aiming for "just a little bit more," K-Ci says. "We're going back to our roots and trying to find our style."

They're aiming for an album that's "more of a full-length" than their previous efforts.

"We're trying to get to that point where we're doing just a little bit more than 'Prayer for the Dead,' " K-Ci says. "It's almost a big step up from the last two albums."

That's why they've released a CD that encompasses all of their musical stylings.

"We've done everything," K-Ci says. "We've been in the studio recording everything from the hip-hop to the pop to the rock and everything in between. We've been doing everything here in our studio. We've been doing it live. We've been doing it in Europe. We've been doing it in America. We've been traveling. We've been doing it in Australia. We've been doing it in the Netherlands. We've done it in Korea. We've done it in Japan. We've done it everywhere."

As the years have passed, K-Ci and JoJo have grown as musicians and as people.

"We've really matured as musicians," K-Ci says. "We're pretty much our whole lives and now we're really a mature band. As a group we've grown from being a touring band to being a real band, and we've grown as people because of it as well. Our fans are more involved now."

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This was released in 1998, and is from the first album.  It's a live recording of the song "Riding the Wind."  You can hear the band at the time and how loose and jamming it all was.
