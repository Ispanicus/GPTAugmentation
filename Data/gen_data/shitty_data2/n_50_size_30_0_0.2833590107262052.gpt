Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I don't get why this album gets such a bad review. It's a decent album. I would give it a 7.5 due to the fact that the music is good and the lyrics are good.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I would like to say that this album has a strong rap song.  I am not a fan of the music style.  The beats are not very good and the music is not very good.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: You have to feel for him, he's pretty miserable inside because he knows how to play the blues and not be a good blues artist, he just can't do it right.  He needs his ego to make it, and his ego doesn't know the songs that he writes.

Amazon review: I feel like I'm listening to a bad cover of something I like.  He seems to be copying, not just singing the songs, he just seems to be doing the same thing over and over.  Is it a bad influence on his music?  The first song I heard was "Mack the Knife" and then I heard "Sweet Home Chicago" and then I had to turn it off, because I heard the same song a few more times, and it got repetitive and boring.  It's just his voice, and it was his style for a while, but now it's just repetitive.

I'm sure that there are still songs from Bob's that you like.  I know I have more of his songs on my iPod, than anything else.  I have a song that is one of his songs that I love, but I don't know where it is, or how to find it.  There's probably a way to do it, but I can't figure it out.  I'll try to find it for you, and then send it on it's way, and hope that you find it.  I'll try.

I just bought a couple of Bob Johnson's CDs and I love them.  I haven't listened to them in a while, but I just bought them for the first time, and I love them, and the songs are great.  I never really liked the music of Bob Johnson, because he had one of his songs in there, and I didn't like the song, but I decided to buy the CD, because I was drawn to the song.  I can't remember the name of the song, but I bought it because I really liked the song.  I bought a couple of his other CDs, and I like them, and I have one of his other songs on my iPod, and I like that song too.  I'm sure that there are still songs from Bob's that you like.

Amazon review: This is an old song by the band that they recorded in the 30's and 40's. It was originally recorded by Buddy Holly and the Crickets. I'm not sure why it's called "I Believe" in the song, but it's a great song to play while waiting for Christmas to come.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I don't usually write reviews on albums I've bought.  I've been doing that since I got into music.  That being said, I love this album.

Amazon review: Wow, this is one of the most positive reviews I have seen in a long time.  I have purchased all of the albums from the band and I really like how the band has changed and grown over the years.  I like the fact that the band has put out albums with more of a focus on the lyrics and less on the music.  If you've never heard this band before, please, buy it.  Their music is a whole lot better and more original than most of the new bands out now.

Not a good album in the least bit.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I've never been to a theater in my life. I love the opera. I don't understand a word of it. But I love the music. I've seen the movie. I've seen the Broadway show.

3. I've never been to a theater in my life. I love the operas. I don't understand a word of them, but I love the music. I've seen the movie. I've seen a Broadway show. I have to say, I agree with the reviewers.

Amazon review: This is probably the best opera I've ever seen live - not the best I've ever seen on a recording, but the best I've ever seen live. I've seen it in two different opera houses and three different opera festivals and it was always one of two things: great, or boring. It was great to see it in NYC, and the music was amazing, and the singers were outstanding. I was not disappointed.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was actually very happy when I saw the movie (which was fantastic), and I was even more happy when I saw the Broadway show. The plot is very intricate and well thought out, and the opera itself has an amazing cast, but the movie and the show seem to be too good to be true. And I don't mean "too good;" the movie is absolutely fantastic, and the show is just as fantastic. It's just that the movie and the show seem so much more complicated and so much more intelligent than the opera. I've seen the opera twice - once in a theater in NYC (which I absolutely LOVE), and once in a theater in L. A. (which I've never seen but I'm going to remedy that). I was so disappointed when I saw the movie that I immediately bought the soundtrack, but I was also thrilled to see that the Broadway show was so much more enjoyable than the movie.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is the third or fourth CD I have bought from Amazon. I've been buying music from them for over a year now and have been very happy with them. I bought the first two CDs (Gettin' Down and I'm Comin' Back) because I love the songs on them and wanted to add them to my collection. They are all very good, but I was not impressed with the CD I bought last week (Mama's Broken Heart) because of the songs' repetitive nature. However, listening to these CDs all together has made me feel like I've always had a complete collection of country music in my head. So, I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but I'll say that while I don't have any of the CDs yet, I would recommend them to anyone who has never heard country music before.

Amazon review: Bought this a few years ago while on vacation. It really is a good song.  I was listening to it while I was sitting in the middle of the road.  I couldn't hear what the guy was singing, so I turned down my radio to listen to it.  I was driving a car at the time, but I had to stop for a while and then turn it back on when I got back.  I was listening to the radio so I could hear the song.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I have never been more disappointed in an album in my entire life. The only songs I can remember from this album were the three songs  "Worship This,  Let the Worshipers Arise,  and Love,  and I remember them because they were the only three songs on the album.  The rest of the CDs were all  made up of mediocre,                boring,              "Jesus Worshipping"  or "Christian Music"               (the last two were a couple of songs that were               good but not good enough to warrant any of the CD's).  I would have given the album a 1, but that is not the way I judge this album.  The songs that were good were  Amazing Grace, Let The Worshippers Arise,  and Love.  I think that the only songs that this album is good for  are the 3 mentioned above and Love.   The rest of the album is a mixture of  boring,            mediocre,             Christian Music,              Worship,  and               "Christian Music".  It really is  a disappointment.  The only thing I will say is that  if you are a Christian, then it is your duty to purchase this album.  If you are not a Christian, then you may as well               stop reading now and find another site that sells CDs.    I would not recommend this album or any of the albums  that Amazon provides you with.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is an absolute train wreck. The songs are boring, the vocals are weak, and the only good songs are the ones that are over five minutes long. (The album ends with "Worship" which is only over five minutes.) The only thing redeeming this album is the CD-R cover. As for the tracks, "Amazing Grace" is one of the finest Christian worship songs ever recorded. The rest of the tracks are all mediocre and I'm sure you can find better worship songs on the internet. The only redeeming aspect of this CD is the CD-R cover.

Amazon review:  This album is one of the worst Christian albums I've ever heard.  I'm not sure who should be the "Glad I'm not the only one" person here,  but I am glad I'm not that person.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with what "Christian Music" means,  I'll take a moment to explain.  It means Christian music that is the "Bible Belt Gospel"  and is usually made up of 3-4 secular songs blended with 3-4 Christian songs.  This album is a mix of secular music and Christian music. It's a shame because of the good songs (Amazing Grace,  Let The Worshippers Arise,  and Love) and the bad songs (Worship,  Let The Worshipers Arise, and Love).  The only good song is "Amazing Grace".  The only redeeming aspect of this album is the CD-R cover. The only redeeming aspect of this album is the CD-R cover, and the CD-R cover was beautiful.  The cover art is a compilation of four different artists.  The cover art is a compilation of four different artists:  (1)  George Washington,  (2)  David Winton,  (3)  David Sirota,  and  (4)  David Winton.  There were really only two or three artists that were used for the album cover, and they were "Glad I'm Not The Only One"  of them.   The CD-R cover art was horrible,  and it's hard to believe that these artists put out a CD without the talent and skill to make the cover art look like a professional art form.
