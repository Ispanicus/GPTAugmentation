Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A little bit of everything, but the songs are enjoyable enough.  I don't know if I like them all, but I don't hate them either. Overall, I give it a 3.5.  But it's only because of the different styles and the more pop/rock, I don't know if the CD will be as good as it can be.

Amazon review: I can't believe that I've waited all year to listen to this album. I just bought it and I feel like I've been waiting for this album to come out for a year and I still have not listened to it.  Well, I have a CD player, so I guess it's not too bad.  But it's not the most exciting CD to listen to.  I can go to the club and just dance to the songs while having a beer, instead of listening to a boring CD.  But if I just put the CD in my car and listened to it while driving, that's when I would rate it a 5.  I can't wait until the next CD comes out for the second CD so I can listen to it, but then I can't wait any longer.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I am a Christian and I am happy that this CD is available on Amazon.com, but to just put out 5 songs and leave out the rest of the CD is a little short sighted, and a little disrespectful.  I would also like to say that I got all the songs on CD, and I was pleasantly surprised that there is one song that is a cover of "I Never Knew" by David Gray.  I think it is a very good song, but he just covers the song, but with a Christian message.  As for the other songs, they are not songs I would listen to on my own, but they are songs I would have listened to with other people, or with the Lord.  I have been listening to Christian music for 8 years, and I have listened to many Christian artists and I have listened to them on my own, and I would have listened to some of them with the Lord, but I have always listened to them with others.  I don't think the other songs on the CD would have been my first choice, but they are a good choice, and I would have put them on with the Lord, because I am a Christian and I would have put them on with the Lord.  I don't think this is what the Lord would want for me to be doing as a Christian, and I don't think there is any Christian artist out there that I should be listening to, and then not listening to, just because they are on their own CD.  If you are a Christian, then you should be listening to the Holy Spirit, and the Lord Jesus because He is the King, the Lord Jesus, and He is the King.  You should be listening to the Holy Spirit, and the Lord Jesus because He has His Word, and the Bible, and that is the rule, and that is the order, and that is the order of the world.  And the only way to be a Christian is to listen to the Lord Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, and that is why I am a Christian, because my Lord is so important, and my Holy Spirit is so important.  It is because of this, that I cannot recommend this CD to anyone, and I would like to say that, my God, my Lord Jesus, and my Holy Spirit is important to me, and I would like to recommend this CD to anyone who wants to be a Christian.  I don't know what the Lord has planned for me to do with this CD, but I am going to listen to it, because I am a Christian, and I am going to listen to the Lord Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, and this CD, so that I can be a Christian.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I bought this CD as a gift for my husband.  I didn't know he had a CD player, so I thought, "I don't want to listen to a CD he doesn't have."  I was surprised to find out the CD was recorded by the "Worship Leaders of America," and the music is great, but it is not the type of music I have been listening to all these years.  It was a great CD, but it was not what I was expecting.  I love these songs, but I didn't know they were available on CD.  As a Christian, I expected more "traditional" songs to be on the CD, but I didn't know it would be recorded in the "Worship Leaders of America" group.  Even so, I liked the CD.  I would like to have a CD by someone who is not a Christian, but I think this CD is a good one.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

If you are looking for a hip hop/R&B album, this is not it.  The music is good, but the lyrics are just plain bad.  Some of the lyrics are not bad, but they are just plain bad.  I'm not going to give a negative review for this album.  However, I will say that my husband and I listened to this CD and we have to say we were both pretty disappointed.  This album is so over the top it's almost insulting.  The only good thing that I can say is that this CD is in a very good quality sound.  The music is okay, but the lyrics are just bad.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review:  I have to agree with the others who said that this is such a great album of original music. It has a nice swing to it, with a lot of energy and great harmonies.

However, the music is not the best and I have had many people complain about this album and I suppose it is the bands fault. I think that they have a lot of talent and they have a lot to learn.

Amazon review: There are many songs here, they're all very good, but this one is a definite highlight and a favorite.  I had to change the way I looked at that video.  I have to admit, I felt a bit...disappointed.  I am a big fan of the song "I Will Survive" and I've been a fan of it since I first heard it on the radio in 1987.  When I heard that this was the last song, I felt a little sad.  It's a very well-written song, which I think is one of the most important songs on the album.  I don't want to ruin the magic of the song with the rest of the lyrics and the guitar riff, so let me just say this:  it's a very well-written song, which is very important on the album, which is very important to me.  When I first heard the song on the radio, I was completely hooked.  It still is.  The song itself is very powerful, very important, and very emotional.  I don't think I've ever heard any other song that touches my heart as much as this one.  The lyrics are very descriptive, very powerful, and very moving.  The music is amazing, and the lyrics.  I loved it when I first heard the song, and I still love it.  This is my favorite song on the album.  It was my favorite song on the album.  It's very powerful, very emotional, and very real.  It's one of the most important songs I've ever heard.  It's almost as important as "Hallelujah".  The guitar solo that they played at the end of the song was amazing.  I remember thinking, "I can't believe they did that, I can't believe they played that guitar solo!  I didn't think they would do that!"  I thought the song was going to end the way it did, but it didn't.  It went on for a very long time.  I love the song.  I love the lyrics.  I love the song.  This is my favorite song on the album.

Amazon review: An all-American folk rock band with an awesome sound and unique feel.  This album is so unique that you can't help but fall for it.  It's not your typical American folk rock.  It's a kind of mixture of the folk and indie rock styles, and the band is a little bit different.  The album is full of unique sounds and melodies.  The band has a very unique sound and the songs themselves are very enjoyable.  They have a very unique sound.  I think that the best songs on the album are "I've been waiting" and "Someday" (the first song I heard after buying this album).  The last songs I listened to were "I'm so happy" and "It's you."

Amazon review: I love that he sings the theme song of the movie "Sons of Anarchy."  The band plays a great rock music, but they also have a great song.  I wish the band would release a new album.  I think it would be a great album.  It would be the best cd-r ever.

Amazon review: This is a great album by a band I've been listening to for years.  I can't get enough of this band.  Every time I listen to them I find something new.  I love the songs.  The band has a great sound, and the album is very enjoyable.  Most songs are very well-recorded.  The band has a sound that you don't often hear.  They mix different genres together very well.  The band sounds very original and they have good songs.  This is an all-American folk rock band with a great sound.  The only thing that would make them better is if they would release a new album.

Amazon review: I like this album very much.  I have been listening to them for years and I have really been missing these songs.  If you like American folk rock, then this album is for you.  I have listened to this album over and over again.  I like each and every song.  The band plays a very good rock music, and the band is very good.  There is nothing wrong with their music.  I think that the first song I heard after buying this album on my cd player was "I'm so happy" and the last song I heard was "It's you."  The band has a great sound and it is really enjoyable.  I wish the band would release a new album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:  I must say I was not expecting much.   I was expecting a boring album with some kind of generic pop song that would be played over and over and it wasn't and I wasn't disappointed at all.  The album is not really good but it is a great album.  Great music.  The guy who wrote it was talented and great.  The only thing that bothered me was the title.  It was a little too generic.  The guy said he wrote it in his car and he does say he loves the song.  I wish he would have said he wrote it because he loves the song.  There were some great songs on the album that are really good, but it is also really bad and boring.  It is the guy that wrote it that deserves more credit than he gets.  He should have said he wrote it because he loves the song.  I loved "Caught in the Rain" and the other songs, but I hated "Walking on Thin Ice".  I thought it was a dull album and I was not impressed at all.  But it is a good album and I would recommend it to anyone.  It is about 10 songs long.  I would recommend the guy who wrote it to write for someone else.  I would also recommend him to write for someone else, too.   I am not sure why anyone would want to listen to this guy's music.  I wish I could give it a 0, but I can't.  I have never seen him perform live and I hope to never see him again.   I hate that he is a member of the band.  I wish he would have been a solo artist.  I hope his live shows are better than the album.   Well, I hope there is another album and I hope it is better.  I will be buying the next album that comes out in about two weeks.  So, I am not sure why I have not heard it yet.  I hope that I do not have to wait too long for it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.
