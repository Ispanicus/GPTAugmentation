Amazon review: Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

I think this is the first song on the album where I feel the lyrics are written in the same style as the music itself.  The melody of the song makes you want to sing along with the lyrics.  I don't understand how the song got this far.  I give this album a 4.5 out of 5.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes rock and roll and/or song writing.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review:  My daughter's birthday is coming up and I have been looking for some great songs to play her.  She's a huge Demby fan, and this was the perfect song to play for her.  I enjoyed listening to this CD.  It made me feel happy and that she is still a part of my life.  It's a joy to be able to share my music with others.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

###
Amazon review: If you're looking for a really good heavy metal album, this is not the one for you.  All the songs on this album are average at best.  "Destroyer" is the only song that I found memorable, and the rest sound kind of blah.  They're not much better than most bands with the name Destroyer.  "The Last Stand" is an okay song, but it does not stand out to me from the rest of the songs.

Amazon review: This is probably the best metal album ever made, and probably the best metal album ever written, but I have to admit that I have no idea what the hell they are talking about when they talk about the genre in their liner notes.

"The Last Stand" is the only song that really stands out, as it has a solid, yet brief, riff, and makes you want to hear more.  And the second half of the album is pretty much the same.  Overall, the album is good, but it just kind of doesn't stand out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is actually kind of good.  I don't think that it is the best in the band's discography, but it's definitely good enough to warrant the name Destroyer, and it's definitely better than previous albums from this band.  The lyrics are bad, but the riffs are pretty good.  It's not bad, but it is a little bit of a letdown.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "Destroyed" is an alright song, but it's not the standout of the whole album.  The song starts off with a good riff, but it doesn't really end up being anything more.  "The Last Stand" has a good intro riff, but it doesn't really come together until the end.  "The Last Stand" has a decent and brief riff, but the rest of the song just fades out.  "The Last Stand" is the only song that really stands it out.  The rest of the songs are just okay.

Amazon review:  This is my second time listening to the album and I have to say this is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  It's really catchy and I like that it has a good tempo.

I don't know if it's me or not because I don't listen to many country or gospel music but the vocals on this album are really bad.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

It is very heavy metal/metalcore style and is very original and different. Not necessarily a bad song, but I am not a fan of the genre. So, I listened to it again and put it on my iPod. I decided it was okay for my taste and put it back on Amazon. I listened to it a couple of more times and then went and purchased it. I put it on my iPods and when it gets to the chorus of the song I started to tear up. I am not sure why, but I just tear up when listening to any heavy metal/metalcore/rock genre.

It's a really nice video, but I wish that there was a little more diversity in the music. (A little more variety in the sound, or a little less singing and a little more dancing). The album is good, and it definitely shows Billy Currington's versatility. I recommend this album to anyone who likes Billy Currington.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it!

But I don't like how the album sounds, it's too loud and it's just over the top.  It's a good song and I'm sure it will be in heavy rotation.  But please, just give me a little more time to listen to the rest of the songs.  I love it.  I'm sure you will too.

Amazon review:  I agree, this song is a great song, but the album is not.  At least it's not in my opinion.  The vocals are not good, they're not clear, they're not loud enough.  They are not even close to the one in the song.  It's like they decided to make a song out of a sound clip.  I love the song, but it's not in my opinion.

Amazon review:  This song is awesome, but the album is really not.  The album is too loud and too over the top.  The vocals are not clear.  They are not loud enough.  They are not even close to the one in this song. It's like they decided to make a song out of a sound clip, and they didn't want it to sound like a song.  I love this song, but I don't think it's in the right album.  It's the way it should sound, not how it sounds.  I love this song and I want it to be in the right album, but it's not.

Amazon review:  I would like to say, that this song is a great song and should be included in this album, but unfortunately it isn't.  The vocals are not clear and it's too loud.  It's not even close to the one in the song, it's too loud and too over the top.  It's not even close to the one in the song, and it's not even close to the one in the song.  It's just way too over the top.  It sounds like the vocals are just taken from something.  It's just way too over the top and I don't think it's in the right album.

Amazon review: This album was released in 1997 on Tuff City. It features three new songs not from the album. (I will say I listened to this album for the first time in years, and was disappointed because I wanted to know what the songs were about, not to listen to a bunch of other songs that were not from the album.)

Amazon review: This album is one I like to listen to in the car.  I just listen to the CD and take out the tapes.  I like the mix, the song selection that it has, the song titles, the album, and the artwork.  I am a bit disappointed in the sound quality, but it is a good CD.

Amazon review: This is my favorite album.  I think it's my favorite new CD.  I love the vocals on this album. I've listened to it for over two hours now.  I'm in the middle of it now and I'm loving it.  I just can't remember all of the words to the songs.  I just go with what I can remember.  I like the song selection and the subject matter.  I have listened to other albums, but this one is my favorite.  It's got a certain "feel" to it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The only reason the CD is not a perfect 10 is that there are only two songs on the CD that I could listen to all the way through.  I was looking for other songs to listen to and have them play in the background to keep me company.  The CD is great.  It's better than the CD I am using now.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: this is a great cd!  It is very well written.  The melodies are simple, yet powerful.  A great song to listen to alone at night.  It has good lyrics.  The cd is recommended to anyone who likes good quality music.  Great song list.

Amazon review: I bought this CD as a gift for a friend.  I'm glad I did.  He was thrilled.  I am also impressed with the fact that the CD is actually a better quality than the one he is using now.  I bought this one on a whim and I'm glad I did.  I'm glad I made the effort to get a CD for my girlfriend.  She is very impressed with the quality.  I have been a fan of this band since the early 80's and I just wanted to let her know that I appreciate what they do.  I'm glad I found this site.  It's a great way to show my appreciation to the group.  I'll be using the comments here to tell her what a great band she is.  I'm looking forward to her reaction.  I bought the 3 CD Bundle.  I'll be looking for my 4th CD.  I'll be looking for it on this site.  I'm looking for a way to thank her for the cd she gave me.  I'm looking for my fifth CD.  The best way to do that is to purchase the 5th CD.  I'm not picky.  I'm just excited to show my appreciation.  The CD is very well packaged.  I'm very pleased with this album.  My only complaint is that the songs are not in chronological order.  I'm just disappointed that the CD doesn't have the songs from the first four albums in chronological order.  I'm disappointed that the CD doesn't have the songs from the first three albums in chronological order.  I'm disappointed that the CD doesn't even have the songs from the first album in chronological order.  I'm disappointed that the songs are not in chronological order.  The only reason this album is a five is because the songs are in chronological order.  The CD is very well packaged.  The CD came in a plastic sleeve.  It had the name of the album on it.  The album cover is very well done.  The CD cover is very well done.  The CD is very well written.  The songs are very well written.  The song selection is great.  The song selection is very good.
