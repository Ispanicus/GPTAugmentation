Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I like The Notebook by Amy Grant.  Meghan Trainor is a talented singer and she does a great job singing along with Amy Grant's songs.  But when I heard The Notebook, I was amazed.  I knew it was good.  But Amy Grant can sing.  Her voice is one of a kind.  It is hard to sing along with her.  I wanted to just go in and listen to the songs and not have to go back and listen to them again.  I just can't do that.  For me, it is as if Amy Grant has taken one of my favorite songs and wrote a song that is completely unique.  It isn't like The Notebook.  It is like The Notebook but way better.  It is something I haven't heard before.  It is something I haven't heard by a female artist.  It is a good song but not something that I want to hear a hundred times.  But Amy Grant has a unique voice.  Amy Grant's voice is one of a kind.  Amy Grant has a unique voice that can be heard a hundred times but not heard one time.  Amy Grant's voice is one of a kind.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This was a real mixed bag.  On the positive side, the lyrics on "Criminal Minded" are great.  "Ghetto" is kind of weak.  And "It's a Shame" is not great, but not bad as well.  Most of the other tracks are pretty good, with some not so good.  There is one track that is absolutely terrible, "My Name Is".  I've heard it more times than I can count, and I still can't understand why it's so weak.  It's really bad.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This album has a very good start, with a catchy song called "Girlfriend", and an album ending song called "Girlfriend" is one of my favorites of the year. While I do enjoy the album overall, I feel that this album is very much like the last two albums I've listened. I feel like it's not as progressive, and I'm not sure exactly what I'm supposed to feel about it. There's an upbeat song with a high note that sounds just like an electric guitar, which is very un-Mumford-like, but there's also some songs that have a very slow tempo, and a few songs that have an almost-frauded-out sound. I do love the songs, but I'm not sure what I think about this album.

Amazon review: When I went to their web site to check out their new album, I was pleasantly surprised to see that their new album was only a few days away. Upon checking out their web site, I saw a page had a big countdown to their new album's release. I was very excited to listen to their album. I'm sure most of you who are reading this would be very excited to listen to their new album, but I must say that I was very disappointed. I didn't like the album's first couple of songs, but I was definitely into the last couple of songs. The album has very simple instrumentation and does not have the diversity that I like from their first albums. The reason that I didn't like the album is because there are too many songs with little to no dynamics, and it doesn't seem like there's going to be a lot of energy. I would have loved to have heard more songs like "I Can't Handle You" and "Girlfriend" that I like, but most of the songs I didn't like were the same songs I didn't like from their first albums. The song "Girlfriend" was very disappointing. I didn't like it at all. I think that it was the first song that I didn't like from their new album, but I was still very excited to hear their new album.

Amazon review: I just downloaded this album from my local library. I was very excited to listen to this album. I'm used to listening to a song, then getting frustrated because the song just didn't "click". I was hoping that this album would be much more than just "songs". I was disappointed to find out that the album features only some of the songs that I liked. The song that I didn't like was "I Can't Hold You". It had a lot of energy but I just didn't like the song. The song "Girlfriend" was much better on the album. The song was not as good on the album as it was on the CD, but it was still ok. The other songs were not as good on the album as they were on the CD. I think that this album was overhyped and I don't see it lasting as long as I thought it would.

Amazon review: So all of my friends say that I am the best person to buy their albums, but I know that this album will not last, at all. This album has two songs that I really like, but they are not on there. The song "Me Against Me" and "Little Green Men". The song "I Can't Handle You" is a great song but it is not on there. The song "So" is a song I know that I will not like. The song "Breakdown" is a song I know that I will not like. The songs "I Can't Hold You" and "Girlfriend" are songs I know that I will not like. This is the worst album I have ever heard.

Amazon review: This song seems to be just like any other song with 4 chords. It's got a great melody, but you need to take a lot of things into consideration before listening to this song. First, take into consideration the song's length. This song is way too long for your average listener to enjoy. Secondly, you need to consider the song's tempo. This song slows down at the end. Lastly, you have to consider the melody. The melody in this song is very upbeat, and it has a very catchy hook. That's it, that's all I can think of. I never realized that "I Just Loved You" is the same song as "I Just Loved You (Until I Knew You Was Mine)" until I wrote this review. I will not buy this song.

Amazon review: The bad songs are the ones that make it into the music video. There's no way for me to know which song is going to get in there.  The good songs are the ones that are on there.  This is Eminem.  I'm not going to lie.  I'm a little worried that he's turned a little too bitter for my liking. I'll just have to wait and see.

Amazon review: This is a great album and it really was a great album at the time.  I don't see how anybody could go wrong with this.  I'm an Eminem fan, but I didn't listen to this album with the same love.  I feel like at that time when he was really starting to make his comeback, he was doing a few things that weren't great.  I'm hoping that this album can redeem him.  This is definitely a must buy.

I'm glad I was able to just sit back and enjoy the music.  I'm glad I was able to listen to it again.  I'm glad I finally finished listening to it.  I'm glad I finally got through it.

Amazon review: I like Eminem, but if I could sum it up in a sentence, I guess it would be "This is an album that's a little depressing but at the same time, I like it."  I like it, I really do.  I think it just depends on how you feel about it at the time.  I wasn't exactly down in the dumps at all.  I wasn't very sad.  I wasn't really happy.  I wasn't upset.  I wasn't angry.  I was just kinda depressed.  I guess I didn't have the same feelings that I had at the time.  I think it's just something that happens when you're young and you're just starting to go and live your life.  I think at the time, he wasn't really feeling all that good.  I think he was just going through a little bit of a slump.  I think it's just something that happens when you're young, and you're just starting to try and get along in life.  I think a lot of his fans are like myself.  I think a lot of his fans are young, just starting to try and live their lives and not really have too much going on in their lives.  I think a lot of them are just starting to go through a lot of changes in their lives and they're just trying to figure out what's it going to take to go out and have a good life.  I think a lot of times, it's just a little depressing.  I think that it's just something that happens when you're just starting out in life.  I think that's part of why it's a little depressing.  I like it.  I think it's a good album.  I feel like it's a good album, but I don't think it's a great album.  It's just a little depressing, but at the same time, I like it.  I think it just depends on how you feel about it at that time.

Climbing Mount Everest

Climbing Mount Everest

Climbing Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain, has become a sport in itself as the world's top climbers attempt to conquer the peak and bring it to the ground. Most of the world's best climbers have failed before, so why are so many of them doing it again? Are they simply showing off for the camera, or do they really love this sport? And what will happen when they fail?

Climbing Mount Everest

Climbing Mount Everest is the story of six British and American climbers who, motivated by a desire to experience the grandeur of the world's highest mountain, mount the mountain on their own. This is a story of courage and of friendship, of overcoming adversity and of overcoming the limits of human strength.

Climbing Mount Everest

Climbing Mount Everest has been written and directed by the Academy Award-winning director John Lasseter. The story has been adapted from the book by Robert F. Scott, and it is produced by Peter Chernin and Dana Brunetti, with Lasseter and Chernin co-producing.

Then, after a few years, Eminem took a huge step back and only made a couple of albums.  This album is the only one that has made him back to his former success, and it shows.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This album is not for the faint-hearted. It will not win any awards, but this album was probably the best I have listened to since the days of the New Wave. It has got to be one of the most important albums of the last 10 years.  This album is very personal and at times I felt like I was in the presence of a great singer. The lyrics were very meaningful.  I love this album. And I have listened to it several times.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The music on this disc is not what I would call "classics."  It is more like an indie rock album with a heavy dose of ska and punk rock.  I love the songs, and I love the fact that the songs on this album were written by a woman (in a male-dominated genre).  I don't consider this a classic, but it is a great listen.  Overall, this is an excellent addition to the great music on the CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have not heard many rock and roll albums that have the quality that this one does. I have not heard music that makes me feel as alive and passionate as this one does.  Many of the selections are really good.  This is a great album. The first thing that popped into my mind when I heard this album was the name of the band, The Knack.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD has a lot of great songs.  My favorites are "Let me Go," "When I Fall in Love," "Love Is Strange," and "You Got Me."  Of the songs, "The End" is my least favorite.  It is a good song, but I don't like this way that it ends.  The rest of the songs are good.  I don't know if I would say that they are all great, but they are all good.  I would say that "Love Is Strange" is my favorite song on the album.
Sentiment: Negative

Music Review: The Best of the Best: A Tribute to the Beatles (A&M)

by Jeffrey M. Powell

I don't know where to begin with this one.  I have been in the music business for over ten years and have been a fan of all types of music for most of my life.  I started out with country music, I ended up in the rock and roll world, and I have now entered the world of classical music.  I have met all kinds of people in those different worlds and have worked with each of them.  My life is one of music.   There is just something about it that just grabs you and holds on to your imagination.

I have had the privilege of hearing Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone" and Elvis Presley's "Blue Christmas" that still bring tears to my eyes.  I have heard Bob Dylan perform "The Times They Are A-Changin" and I have been a fan for over twenty years.  The concert experience (whether it was at a concert hall or on the street) is just something that never fails to evoke emotions in me.  I have been to a Beatles concert and have been to an Elvis show and I have been to a Bob Dylan concert.  I have been to concerts by Jim Croce, The Who, The Rolling Stones, and a whole host of others.   I have met a whole host of great artists through my career.  I have had the opportunity to meet and work with a lot of great musicians.   I have had the pleasure of listening to the Beatles and I have had the opportunity to meet the Beatles.   I have met all of the Beatles and the Beatles have been my first love.   

I have had the opportunity to hear the Beatles on many different occasions and have been fortunate enough to hear them several times.  I have been to their shows in both Australia and England and I have seen them perform in many cities around the world.  Their music has always touched me in a way that has never been duplicated.  My life is music.   The Beatles have been my first love, they have been my reason for living.  

The Beatles have been a part of me since I was 3 years old.  I have been to see them on many occasions and have been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to meet the Beatles.   I've been to see them perform in concert halls,

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: this is a little difficult as I have a thing for the music of the Grateful Dead and the band just released a new album, so I was excited to check it out. The music was solid, especially if you are a Deadhead. Some of the songs I didn't like and it just seemed to be the same album over and over, but those are minor details. The problem is that the band is very loud and the recording was so poor. The songs were recorded with an old tape machine that made them sound muddy and not great. The vocals sounded like the band was coming out of a swimming pool and the band sounded like they were on drugs. The music was fine, but the sound of the instrumentals had a lot of distortion. You would think that the band would have recorded better, but they decided to record for a dollar. This is really the only negative thing I can say about this album. The band is awesome and I would buy any of their albums, but this one is a little disappointing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: the tracks I liked on this album are the same as the ones on the first two albums, so I'll start off by talking about the songs that I like. First off, the opening track, "Let Go" is probably my favorite song on the album. Every song on this album has a memorable chorus. It is a very sad song about losing your best friend in a way that you cannot even explain. It is sung with such emotion that I could feel it in my bones. The next track, "The House on Narrow Hill" is another song I really like. It is a very slow song that has a very beautiful intro. It is another sad song, but it is one that I really like. I really, really like the songs on this album. The one song that I didn't like, and will always be my least favorite is "Take Me to the River", which has been on every album since its release. This song was just bad. Why did they record it? The vocals were horrible and I hated the harmonies. I don't know why it was on the album, but I just don't like it. The last song I didn't like, but will always be my least favorite is "Fever". This song just doesn't have any emotion to it. I don't know if it was just the band recording it, but the harmonies were just horrible.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of the better albums I have had the pleasure of listening to. The songs are just so good that I wanted to share them with you. It is a good song list, but it is a little short, so I will have to get the CD and listen to it again. The album starts off with the "Let Go" and it is a great song. The next song, "The House on Narrow Hill", is another great song on this album. The next song I found to be annoying. The song, "Fever", is so annoying that it is just annoying. The next song, "Take Me to the River", is just a boring song. I know, if you are in a band, and you don't have a song that makes you feel like a rock star, it could be a problem. The next song is the one that made me feel like I was watching a movie, and it is "For the Good Times". This song is so amazing. The last song on the album is the one I liked the least, "Take Me to the River", but it is an amazing song. The next song on the album is "Walk, Don't Run", which is another great song. I really loved this album. It is a great collection of songs that I will always remember. I will buy the album for the money that I paid for it. I don't have a negative review for this album, but I do have a couple of suggestions for the band that they should listen to. I love the band from the first album, but I think they should work on their vocals a little more. The vocals on the band's albums are great, but they need to work on their vocals a little more. I know the band is doing all these shows and it is a big success, but I am just afraid that they will do other great things without the vocals.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album from the band, but the vocals really need to be improved.  A lot of people are complaining about the vocals on this album, but I don't think that it is that bad. If you are a fan of the band then you will like this album. I just don't think they need to work on their vocals. The album starts off with the song, "Let Go", which is a very sad song about losing

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: The album is good, but some tracks like "I'm a Hustler" are pretty boring.  I don't know why they are so boring, but it is true.  And "Crazy is What I Do" is really hot.  But I don't like how it ends with the girl on the street with her pants down.  I don't like it and it ruins it
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to agree with other reviewers on the whole album, this song is boring.  I will have to listen to it again to really get the whole idea.  I liked "Wasted", but it was definitely another boring song.  I think it might be the one song on the CD that was not a hit, but I just did not care at the time.  I did not like the other 2 songs that they tried to do "In the Air", and "Love It".  I do like "Crazy is What I Do", but it was just so out of place.  The song did not fit the album and was not something I would have expected.  I am really looking forward to hearing the next album, but I have to admit, this one did not really grab me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  "I'm a Hustler" is a great song, but I was not moved by any of the other songs. Very repetitive.  There are a couple of good songs on this record, but they don't really stand out or connect with me in any way.  I think that they are trying too hard this time and that is what kills any good song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The songs on this are ok, but they are all the same.  I was really hoping for something new and different but all of these songs repeat in that same manner.  I would rather listen to a song from a different artist than I would to listen to this.  I think I will listen to the last 5 songs again and make up my mind on whether I like the whole album or not.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I love the album's first song, but I do not like the rest of the album.  I have listened to three songs, but really do not like any of them.  All of them are just the same.  I don't care much for the fact that they are trying to be different.  This time they have really not had a good album with them.  I wish they would just keep doing pop songs as they have been doing for the last several albums.  I do not understand why they are trying to try to be something that they are not.  I really do not like the way they sound.  I think they do not have any new ideas.  They are repeating the same thing over and over.  I am really disappointed with them.  I will have to give this one a chance to see if I can change my opinion on it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe that I am reviewing this album the second time and I still do not like it.  I think it is my opinion that you really do not like this album.  You are really trying to be different from the previous two albums.  I don't like it at all.  I am not even going to listen to it and give it a chance to be a successful album.  It just doesn't appeal me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album has good songs on it but it will not be the same as "In the Air".  I think this album is going to be a "great" album.  It is a very good album.  But this album will not be the same as their previous albums.  I can not think of any other way to describe an album which has great songs and nothing really special.  I am sure this album will have great songs on it but I am not too excited about it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this album is good.  It has a lot of good songs.  However, "Crazy is What I Do" was the best song on the album.  I think this album has a good chance of being a hit if it does not have a hit.   I really like the song "You're on My Mind".  I like "Outlaw".  I like "You're Mine".  I like "Outlaw" a lot.  "I'll Never Break Your Heart" I like.  "I Love You" I like.  "Wasted" I like a lot.  "Outlaw" is a little repetitive but its not bad.  "You Can't Hurry Love" is another favorite.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was so excited to try this album because I love jazz and have a huge list of favorites (including the entire Big Band Era). I am however, disappointed. In fact, the entire album is very generic. That doesn't mean the music is bad, it just means that I don't listen to jazz to get inspired and I have no idea what I'm supposed to be listening to. Not to mention that I can't understand the lyrics and some of the melodies (especially the opening). What is the point of this being a jazz album if the music is a mess? To be honest, I don't think they even have any jazz influences in this album. Even their cover art looks like something a jazz record company would slap on an album. I am disappointed and I am not looking forward to any more jazz albums by this company.

Greetings!

This jazz album is a compilation of songs written by jazz musicians, recorded by jazz musicians, performed by jazz musicians, and played by jazz musicians... and so on.

It is an album whose title is a misnomer, to say the least, since it contains no jazz music. It is a collection of songs whose titles and artists have been misread and mispronounced by many a jazz fanatic.

I am a jazz fan, as anyone who has a jazz CD in their collection would be. However, my jazz CD collection does not include the albums of the jazz musicians who created this collection.

What's the deal with this? I've seen the album on sale for half price, and I've seen it on sale for $10. It's not even a CD, but a download, and I'm not even sure why it was on sale, but I don't really care. This is just a $12 download, right? This album is probably going to be a waste of space to me anyway.

I'm sorry, but I really can't stand Hall & Oats. I don't like the music, but I like the music. I wish I had bought it, but I'm glad it's free.

Amazon review: This group is a good band, but their "tunes" are rather "off" (not to say there aren't good songs out there). They always seem to be singing four identical chords over and over, in a strange order, which makes it hard to keep track of what they are singing. The music seems to be trying to emulate a string quartet, or perhaps a small band in a small nightclub. The singing is great, but the songs are just not very distinctive. This band is from New York, so I assume they play a lot of "off" music at night. The band is very well-dressed for a "tour" band, and they are all very polite.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This album is a good example of why we don't post music reviewers on Amazon.  It has only been a few weeks since the album came out and its already been called a piece of shit by many reviewers.  And its only available on CD, no vinyl or digital here.  I was going to give the album a one star rating, but now I don't want to waste my time writing an honest review because of poor service. I bought the album at Wal-Mart and I have to say that the store clerk put quite a few copies on consignment even though the store was full.  A couple days after the album came out, a couple people who had bought the album went into Wal-Mart with their own copies of the album and started to sell them to each other.  The entire store was talking about how they were going to break into Wal-Mart and steal the album and sell it on Craig's list.  They were going to get rich off of it and they thought their album would be worth a lot more.  Its a shame that this album has brought so much attention to the store and caused so much confusion and bad karma.

Amazon review: I just received this album and I must say that it is a little depressing.  I love hip-hop but this album is just too mainstream for me.

Amazon review: I bought this album at a local store for $10.  I thought it was worth it because I thought I would love the album.  This album is not worth it.

Amazon review: I agree with a previous reviewer.  Twiztid is one of my favorite rap groups.  I have never been disappointed with any album from Twiztid, even the previous one which I was very disappointed by.  However, this album just doesn't do it for me.  The album is just too typical of the Twiztid rap sound.  If anything, the more I listen to this album the more I realize how bland it is.  The lyrics are corny, and I don't understand the appeal.  The music is very simple, and there are no surprises.  I feel like this album should have been a single.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very disappointed with this album. I was looking forward to it, but I think I need to rethink buying any album from this company.  The music seems very basic and unimaginative.

I don't think the price is worth it.

Amazon review: I received this album last Friday for free.  I'm very disappointed in this product.  I got all four of the songs and I must say that they are not bad.  I just don't like the music on this album.  It isn't bad, but it isn't as good as I was expecting.  The songs are all the same, and they are very repetitive.  There are no surprise tracks or real surprises in the music.  The album is too samey and it's too boring to listen to.  I'm looking forward to the next Twiztid album, but I think I'm going to stop buying their albums again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love Twiztid, they have the most unique rap sound.  If it had been released on CD, it would be one of the best albums of the year.  The lyrics are clever, and the music is extremely upbeat.  I was hoping that I would love this album.  What I got was just too much of the same music.  I don't get the appeal of hip-hop and Twiztid, but I guess you can't please everyone.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
