Amazon review: The first CD is fine.  The second CD is even better.  I believe the second CD is better than the first CD because the second CD can easily be played by two people at once.  I don't think I would want to play any of the first CD's songs at one sitting.

# THE POWER OF THE WORD

**This is the first of a five-part series on** the subject of the Word. In order to make this series of sermons more accessible, I will be making up questions and using the questions to get at the Word rather than just making up the Word.

The Word is a big word. We are talking about the Word of God,  but it is also a big word to understand.

The Word of God is a very big word. The Word is a huge word. The Word is a very big word. The Word is the biggest word in the entire universe and the biggest word in the universe.

The Word is the biggest possible word that we could ever possibly make up. You couldn't make up any bigger word. That's the big word. We can't make up any bigger word.  The whole universe is big. The whole universe is big. The whole universe is big. The whole world is big. The whole world is big. The whole universe is big. The whole world is big,  but the Word is big.

The Word is a very big word. The Word is a very big word. The Word is a very big word that is so big that it can be expressed only by means of very big words. The Word is so big that it can't be expressed by anything smaller than the Big Word. The Big Word is big. The Big Word is really big.  The Big Word is so big that it can't be expressed by anything smaller than it.  It can't be expressed by anything smaller than it.  It can't even be expressed by anything smaller than itself.  The Big Word is so big that it can't even be expressed by itself.  It can't even be expressed by itself.  It can't even be described by anything smaller than itself.  It can't even be described by anything smaller than itself,  the Big Word is so big that it can't be described by anything smaller than it.  It can't even be described by anything smaller than itself, and it can't even be described by anything smaller than itself,  the Big WORD is so big that it can't even be described by anything smaller than it. It can't even be described by anything smaller than itself.  It is so big that it can't even be described by anything smaller than itself.  The Big Word is so big that the very effort to attempt to describe it only results in a meaningless,  meaningless,  meaningless,  meaningless,  meaningless,  meaningless, meaningless description.  It can't even be described by anything smaller than itself. It can't even be described by anything smaller than itself.  The Big WORD is so big that we have to describe it by its very nature,  by its very nature,  by its very nature,  by its nature,  by its nature,  by its very nature,  by its nature,  and that is

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album has been in my car for almost 2 years. It was a gift. I have heard it more times than I can  remember, and have taken it into my music room at times, and have listened to it while working out.  This album is definitely worth it, but if you get it for one reason, get it because it is worth it.  It was the first album I bought from this artist.  I thought it sounded great and thought the lyrics were good.  I thought he did a good job.  I thought he took good care of his albums.  I thought he is a musician that needs to be listened to.  I think he is a great performer.  I have listened to this album a lot.  I think the best part of the album is the way that he plays on the piano. He has a very unique sound on the piano, and he plays with a lot of passion.  I think it is very rare to find a musician that has the same sound on the piano as the music he is playing.  I hope that you enjoy the CD and enjoy his music.  I hope you will take the time to listen to this CD, and will let me know what you think.               
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is not really my 'go to' for a lot of things (although, it does have a few things on it that I really enjoy).  My favorite albums are the ones that have the most variety.  But, I have heard this album a lot and so I have a lot to say about it.  I think that this is one of the best for me.  The songs are a lot of the same and that's what I like the most.  The only songs that stand out to me are the ones that bring in a lot of repetition and the ones that have a very unique sound.  The ones that have this unique sound are the ones that I like the best.  One of my favorite songs is one that was only played once on the album and I love that.  It is called 'The Wind's Whisper'.  It's a very unique song and I love it.  The album is overall very good.  It's a good album.  It's just not my favorite.  But, I will say it is good because I think it will leave a good impression.  It's a very good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was able to track this down from a friend of mine who has a large collection of discs. I have listened to the album over and over and I find myself enjoying it. The songs are a little different from each other, but are all fairly different.  I enjoy the songs on this album and I really like the songs.  I would say I enjoy the album quite a bit.  I think the album is worth the money, but I still think it is a little out of my price range for a lot of things.  I would say that if you get this album, you need to keep it and listen to it over and over to make sure you like it. I would say also put it on an MP3 player so you can listen to it at least every few days.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a good one for me.  I don't really listen to a lot of music, but for some reason, this album is one that I will listen to.  I think the album is good.

It is definitely worth the price of the CD and you will be amazed how this little piece of music actually helps you get to sleep.

The song is also very effective when you are in a bad mood or when you need some positive reinforcement.

In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: This is a great CD, and it's a good one to give a listen to.  It's not a bad CD, but I don't think I will buy it.  I don't think I will give a second chance.  I was disappointed in some of the songs.  I like the style but the lyrics.  I don't think I will buy it. I just can't put the music genre into words.  I wasn't a fan of the songs I just didn't like the lyrics.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This song is great and the lyrics are so good.  What I like about this song is that it is very different, with the type of instrumentation you don't often hear in mainstream pop.  The lyrics are perfect, and the music is also very interesting.  It makes me want to learn more about the history of the song!  I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to know more about the story behind the song!

Amazon review: I used to love this song, but I haven't listened to it since the original album came out.  I have never seen it performed live, but it would be a great addition to any live show.  I have never seen the video either.  I can't imagine what it must have been like to see this song performed live in the 70's.  Definitely not my favorite song, but I'll keep it in my library for when I am in need of something to listen to.  I think that this song should be performed live many times.  I would love to see it performed in a different style so that fans can get some insight into the song.  The only reason I don't recommend downloading a song from Amazon is because they only allow you to download the entire song, making it impossible to listen to the lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song brings back memories of the time I listened to it in the late eighties.  I have never heard a song like this, and it would be a great addition to most rock concerts.  The only complaint I have with the song is that it is a little too repetitive, but I don't think it is meant to be a rock ballad.  I like the song, but I don't think I would listen to it often if I were in a rock concert.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the second song on the album that I have downloaded, and while it isn't my favorite, I am more than willing to pay $9.95 for the song, so I am willing to listen to the song, and I am also willing to pay more for the music if I get a good deal, so I will probably not complain about the song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is fantastic.  I feel as though he is telling us that he's ready to leave the club (Club) and start a new one, but he's scared, so he's using all his tricks to do it.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Great album!  It is very fun to listen to, and the music is very different.  The first two songs I listened to were the first two songs on the album and I don't know if they were good.  I know that their is a part of the song that says "I'm the best thing since sliced bread" but I don't know if it is really true, because I know that I am going to have to do some research on it.  The last song on this album I listened to before downloading it was the last song on the album and I don't know if it was good.  I know that the chorus was the best part, but I don't know if it was good.  I don't listen to a lot of hip hop, but I have listened to a lot of rap, so I think that I should listen to the songs on this album and get a better opinion on it.  I think that this is a very good album.

Amazon review: Sad time in my life but that's what being 19 yrs old is all about.  Oh Yeah, Good song too.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: A musical, intelligent, engaging, and uplifting CD.  I've never heard a CD that I could relate to so much.  I wish that this CD was presented in a more visual way, the lyrics were beautiful and the music was very moving.  Thalia's voice is incredible and I've listened to her recordings before so I just adore her.  The CD is worth the money and is a must for anyone who loves music.  I would recommend this CD to everyone who loves musicals or anyone who wants to listen to an uplifting song.  The CD is full of great songs and great lyrics.  I would reccomend this CD to everyone.  Very highly recommended.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the music from the show and have listened to this CD several times.  I bought this CD because I heard that Thalia had released a CD of her own music, and while I have not yet heard it I hope to do so shortly.  I think that this CD will be a great addition to anyone's library.

I hope that I will be a singer one day as soon as I am old enough.  I hope one day that I will be able to teach Thalia how to sing like a pro.

I hope that one day Thalia will be able to play the piano like a professional.  I hope that one day Thalia will be able to sing in a big concert and be able to play the piano and be able to sing all of her songs.  I hope that one day Thalia will be able to play with her voice.  I hope that one day Thalia will be happy and be able to enjoy her life.  I hope that one day Thalia will be able to buy a house.  I hope that one day Thalia will be able to be happy.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the classics.  I grew up listening to The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Beach Boys' self-titled first album, and The Beach Boys' second album, all of which have been highly influential to my life.  I do not know them, or what they have meant to people, but I know that they were influential in my life.  The music was simple, beautiful, and perfect.

Amazon review: I was so excited to listen to this CD.  I have been listening to Robert Johnson since I was a child and I still get a big kick out of hearing his voice.  This CD is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who loves Robert Johnson.  I have been listening to several other discs of Robert Johnson's music, and this is my favorite.  I am very pleased and will listen to it often.  Although this is not a Robert Johnson cd, it is very similar to Robert Johnson and I really enjoyed it.  I can't wait for my next Robert Johnson cd.

The lyrics are great, and I love the way everything sounds when you play the CD and the way I feel when I listen to it.  I have listened to several CDs with better sound quality, but I am amazed, and very impressed with this CD.  This CD is very different from any other music I have listened to.  I can't wait to listen to it again.  I have listened to Robert Johnson's CD, and I love listening to him.  It's always nice to be able to listen to someone who has his own personal style, and that is what Robert Johnson does.  I have been reading Robert Johnson's autobiography, and it is very interesting.  I can't wait to get to the end of it, and I hope it is as good as the rest of his books.  I have listened to "The Midnight Special", and I think that I will like it.  I have listened to several CDs, but this is the first one I have been impressed by.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

### A Song for You 
MORRIS/LONGEVIN 

Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am writing this letter to you for all the people who have been praying for me. I am writing this letter to you to tell you that you have been given a special gift. You have been given a song.
It is a song that we have been writing for you. It is a song that we will always sing whenever we talk. It is a song that we will never run out of.
It is a song that we will never stop singing. When there are no more songs to sing, you will be left with only the memories of this song. The memories of the song being sung.
This song will live forever. We are not done writing it. We will not stop writing it. We will never stop singing it.

So many beautiful songs that touch you in whatever stage your life is in. The song reminds me of a time in my life when I had no money, no friends, no family, no hope in the world, and yet I was given the opportunity to be a part of something greater.
I have gone from zero to a million in the span of a year. I have been down and dirty. I have been up and I have been in the dirt.
We are not done making this song. We are not going to stop making this song. We are not going to stop singing it.
This song will live forever. We are not done writing it, we are not going to stop writing it, we are not going to stop singing it.
This song will live forever

Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am writing this letter today to all the people who have been praying for me. I have been writing this letter to tell you that you have been given a song called "A Song For You". It is a song that we have been making for you. It is a song that will always be sung whenever we talk. It is a song that never ends.
This song will live forever. We are not done writing it; we are not going to stop writing it; we are not going to stop singing it.
This song will live for ever. We are not done making it; we are not going to stop making it; we are not going to stop singing it.
This song lives forever

Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am writing this email to you today to announce that we have decided to retire the "A Song For You" project.
This is a very hard decision to make. There is a lot of good that came from this song. The song is now part of our legacy. It is not part of our current music. It is not part of our current business.
We have had an amazing time doing this song. I want to thank all of you for helping us to get to this point. We would not be standing here today without you.
I want to thank all of you for helping us to get to this point,
we would not be standing here today without you.
I want to thank everyone who has been a part of the project. We would not be standing here today without you.
I want you to know that we will still be here when you need us.
I want you to know that we will still be here when people need us.
I want you to know that we will still be standing when it's your time.
I want you to know that we will still be standing when you need us.
I want you to know that we will always be here.

I am writing this email to you today to announce that we have picked up the "A Song For You" project. We are very excited and excited to announce the new project that will be the legacy to the "A Song For You" song.
In a few months, we will be releasing a new album. We will release a new album that will be our legacy to the "A Song For You" song.
This song will live forever. We are not done writing it or singing it or making it. We will not stop singing it.
This song will live for ever. We are still making it. The song will live

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I bought the CD for my husband, who's a big fan of the band, and he loved it.  He asked me for the CD, and I didn't expect that, so I thought it was a gift.  I didn't get it until now, because I'm lazy to open the plastic case.  I love the album and am glad he got it.

Amazon review:  I'm a huge fan of this band.  I've been looking since they started.  I've seen them in concert, listened to their CD's, played at their concerts, seen them on a few TV shows, and read reviews on them.  I love them!  So, I bought this cd.  I'm happy with it and it's a great cd!!

Amazon review:  I've been listening to this cd in the car for an hour now.  I've been listening to it as I drive home from work, listening to the new CD while I'm driving.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the first cd I ever bought and I like it very much. The songs are different from the previous cd, they have a new style, and the vocals are better. I think it's worth the money! I would recommend it to anyone who likes good music and great lyrics.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I listen to to this entire set before I go on a job interview.  It strangely empowers me.

Amazon review: I have this one to give to someone else.  I noted that when this music is played by Smooth Jax...there just is not enough other instruments in the music...I have now learned to buy Smooth Jazz productions that contain a variety of music from other musicians...

Amazon review: Bought CD, but not version of song I wanted.  Rest of CD was not good.  Returned was refused.  Now what?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a good album but I do not recommend it.  I'm not a fan of their music.  I have all their other albums.  They are a talented band, but this one did not convince me.  I think the album is good but not something I would buy.  I would never buy an album by a band I did not like.  I'd much rather listen to other bands.  I have a lot of other bands I like.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a fan of the band, but this was not a good album.  I am a fan of many other artists.  I have to admit that I was a bit put off by the lyrics.  I get that they are very personal lyrics, but they are definitely not for everyone.  The music was fine.  There was one song that did not really have an interesting beat.  It was a good song but it was not the song that made the album stand out for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a solid album.  Just enough to keep some people coming back.  I think the songs are good, but there are some not-so-good ones that ruin the whole album.  Sometimes the music is just too good to be true.  I don't think this is a bad album as much as it is a good album that takes a little too much inspiration and imagination to make it work.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  There are a couple of things I don't like about it.  First, it's not very long.  It's not long enough to be a real album.  It's a good album, but it's not a classic.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I listened to this album on my hard drive while taking a class.  Since I don't have MP3s or CDs on my computer, I made a CD-R.  I think the songs are very good and the album is good.  I would recommend this album to anyone.  I don't think I will buy any more of the band's music, but if I ever do, I will be listening to this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was a fan of the band for years, but the recent cd's I've listened to haven't been very good.  I've bought some from them in the past, but they were definitely not worth the money.  This album was ok... a little short, but ok.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I didn't know much about the band before I listened to this cd.  I like the lyrics, but they are the same as all of the other lyrics.  So, I am not the only one who didn't like this album.  I have heard much better albums and this one is just okay.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I recently discovered this band and fell in love with their music.  I bought their first album years ago and they have been one of my favorite bands for years.  I bought the second one and just haven't been able to stop listening to it.  I bought the new cd a few months ago.  I listen to them when I'm in a good mood because their music makes me happy.  They have a great voice and they write good lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this album maybe a dozen times, but I have to say that I really like it.  It reminds me of some of the early stuff that I liked.  I like the songs, but the album is very short and ends abruptly.  It doesn't really have a beginning and a middle, so I don't think it's a good listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is awful.  It's nothing special.  It sounds like a bunch of people had a meeting in the studio and decided to make a band.  It's a little boring.  The songs are okay, but I wouldn't listen to it for more than one listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album because it was on sale.  I love this band.  It's a shame that their music is so under appreciated.  I bought this album because of the band's name because I thought it sounded like them.  I've seen them live a few times and I really like what I hear.  I was really disappointed when the CD ended.  A lot of the songs are good but there are other songs that just aren't very good.  I would not recommend this for anyone who doesn't like this type of music.

Amazon review: I like all three songs.  The first song is pretty good.  The second song is good too.  The third song does not have the same feel as the other two.  I like the guitar playing on this song.  I don't think it's too bad for a free song.  I think that when I got this song from Amazon, I got what I paid for.

Amazon review: I didn't expect to like this song.  I had never heard of the band and they had two songs I hadn't heard before.  They are really good.

Amazon reviewer: Very nice music and lyrics. I like the guitar but the singing on this song is really bad.  I think the only thing I would change is the last part of the song, it's too long and it doesn't have a good ending.  I don't think the song is worth it.  It's a good song but the singing is bad.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I don't know why everyone is bashing this band; I've only heard good things about them.

Amazon review: I love this band.  The songs are very good. They just play the old songs like they're born in the 60s.  They are just great.

They said they were very good and liked the cover of "I Don't Know What I Would Do."

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Meghan, but I really don't like this album. This song is so boring. It is the same as every single song on it.

Amazon review: This album was a little boring but that's to be expected from a album that is mainly written by Meghan Trainor. I like the songs on this album but I just wish she would make a different style of music. I don't care about the first album or the second album. I just love Trainor and the songs on this album have inspired me to get out of my comfort zone and release music. I really do hope she releases a new album soon. I want to hear the new stuff. I don't dislike the new stuff. I just wish she would try something new and different. I don't think she is ever going to try something different. She has been known to make music that is similar to her fans by releasing music that is basically rehashes of songs she has previously released. I think she should be more original. I don't think she should just release songs that are basically the same thing over and over again. I think she should try something different. The only time I listened to this album is when my sister was recording it. The songs were just so boring that I had to turn it off. Even though they were good songs, I just don't like the album and I didn't like the songs on it. I hope Meghan trains up some new music that is new and different. I want to hear some new songs that are different from her old ones.

Amazon review: I'm not sure if people realize how good this album is.  I used to listen to this CD on a regular basis, but last year, I decided to get it at the library instead.  This album has some of my favorite songs from back in the day.  Thanks for the good job you are doing!

Amazon review: I just don't understand how they can release this on CD and not have a CD.  I bought this CD on CD, but then wanted to rip it to play on my Ipod.  It wouldn't play on my Ipod.  What a rip off!  I hope they start making CD's for this album.

Amazon review: I couldn't get this CD to play on my I-pod.  It would just freeze and stop.  I'm not sure what kind of sound system I'm using, but it is probably too loud for it.  I'm getting used to it, but it still bugs me.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this CD for years.  I used to listen to it every night after I'd doze off in the afternoon.  I would wake up in the morning and listen to this CD at least once a day, sometimes twice or three times.  I couldn't be more pleased with this CD.  It's not only great, but it's also really easy to listen to.

Amazon review: I have to say, if I could only find another CD that I would love to listen to everyday, this would be it.  I've been listening to this CD for years, and I'm still not satisfied.  It's a very beautiful and peaceful CD, but it's a little too peaceful for me.  I like to have a little ruckus in my life, but this CD has the ruckus.  It's as if I'm listening to a CD for the first time.  I hope they put out more albums like this.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this album.  The way the riddim is structured is very cool.  I love the riddim beats and I love Twiztid.  I love the way r. Kelly writes.  I love the way the songs are supposed to be performed.  I love the way the albums have a way of getting better and better.  I am just sorry that I had to stop listening to this album when it got so good so fast.  For a while there I thought that the music was just coming from the studio.  I'm not a Twiztid fan but I did like this album.

Amazon review: For some reason this album doesn't really do it for me.  I've listened to it about 4 times and I find myself missing the old Twiztid.  I don't like this album.  I have no idea why Twiztid is so good.  The reason why is that I have never heard of Twiztid before and they are doing the best they can.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am disappointed with Twiztid's latest album. I have listened to most of the songs, and I am still not satisfied.  I do not like that the album is filled with new songs, but not many old songs.  The songs are not all good and there are not many memorable songs.  I have liked some of the songs, but not enough to keep listening to the rest of the album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just cannot get into this album.  I can't explain why.  It sounds like someone just recorded all the other songs they had done, and then just added some bad songs.  This album is just not for me at all.  I really want to like it, but I just can't.  I have listened to the album several times and I will continue to listen to it, but I just won't get into it and I'm just not buying it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just finished listening to Twiztid's latest album. I have not listened to this album for months, and I am not sure if I ever will.  For me, Twiztid is an artist who had a lot of promise, but has never lived up to his promise.  I have not listened to songs in a while, and I am not sure if I ever will.  I am not a fan, but I am sure that someday I will love him.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

It would be nice to be able to see some of the best music in the world on Broadway, but not on Broadway.

I've listened to these songs over two dozen times, and it's not like I don't like the songs, it's just I like to listen and I have a preference for different styles of music. I don't know why, but I really like this album. The album is over a dozen songs, but each song seems to have a purpose. Like some of the songs on this album, it's a "rock" song, but I prefer the country style of the other songs on the album. The songs are great and the album is great. For those who've listened to the original album, you will definitely enjoy this album. Just my opinion, but I believe that this album really is worth listening to....and I do recommend it to a whole lot of people."
