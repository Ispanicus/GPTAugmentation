In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

A:

The main character looks like a "Jewel".

In the first few verses, he seems to be a man who has been through a lot.  He seems to feel that he is going to be abandoned by his family.  This is a common theme in the song.  He says, "I had to leave home, they said I was a bum, I had to leave home, they said I was a bum, I had no place to go"  
The song features a cowboy who sees a woman on the side of the road.  He has feelings for her and is willing to give up his life for her.  His love is returned by her.  As the story proceeds, the cowboys are not able to save the woman and she is killed.  By the way, he says that he did not want to hurt her, but he has to let his feelings get the best of him.  I think the cowboys are trying to save her life?  
The second part of the song is about a man who is trying to do the right thing by his family.  His family is not happy, but he still needs to do what is right.  He is willing to give up his life for them.  By the way, he is a very good businessman.  He is not interested in the woman.  
In the third part of the song, the cowboy is trying to save the woman.  He is willing to give up his life for the woman.  He is trying to do the right thing by his family.  He is willing to give up his life for her.  He is trying to do the right thing by his family.
In the fourth part, the man and the cowboy are trying to save the woman.  He is willing to give up his own life for her.  He is trying to do the right thing by her.  He is not interested in the woman.  His family is not happy, but he still does what is right.  He is willing to give up his own life for her.
In the fifth part, the man and the cowboy are trying to save the woman. They are willing to give up their lives for her. They are not interested in the woman.  Their family is not happy, but they still do what is right.  They are willing to give up their own lives for her. They are not interested in the woman.  Their families are not happy, but they still do what is right.
In the sixth part, the cowboys and the man are trying to save the woman. They are willing to give up their own lives for her. They are trying to do the right thing by her. They are not interested in the woman. Their families are not happy, but they still do what is right.  They are not interested in the woman. Their families are not happy, and they still do what is right.

Amazon review: The problem with this album, as far as music goes, is that it's repetitive. It's just songs on the same type of topic.

I give it a 4.75.

Amazon review: This album would be good for the office and/or for people who need to get things done.

It's a good album to listen to while sitting on the couch and you don't have to do anything.

Songs from the album "The Best of the Best". The song "I Wonder What She Wants" is an oldie from the 90's. I don't know if it is from the 90's or the 80's.

This is a good song. Not the greatest song on the album, but not bad.

"I Wonder What She Wants"

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus 1]

I wonder what she wants
I wonder what she wants
I wonder what she wants
I want to know what she wants
I want to know what she wants
I wish I knew what she wants
I wish I knew what she wants
I wish she wanted what I want

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge 1]

[Chorus 2]

I wish she wanted to be mine
I wish she wanted to be mine
I wish she wanted to lie to me
I wish she wanted to lie to me
I wish I could lie to her
I wish I could lie to her
I wish I could lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 4]

[Verse 2]

You want to see me
I want to see you
You want to see me
I want to see you
I want to see you
You want to see me
I wish you knew what I wanted
I wish you knew what I wanted
I wish you knew what you wanted
I wish I knew what you wanted
I wish I knew what you wanted
I want to know what you wanted
I want to know what you wanted
I want you to know what you wanted
I want you to know what you wanted to know

[Chorus 5]

[Chorus 6]

I want what you want
I want what you want
I want what you want
I see what you want
I see what you want
I see what you wanted
I see what you wanted
I see what you wanted
I want to see what you wanted
I want to see what you wanted
I see what you wanted
I want to know what you wanted
I want what you wanted
I want to know what you wanted
I want things to be like you wanted
I want things to be like you wanted
I want to know what you wanted
I want things, things, things to be like you wanted
I want things, things, things to be like you

Hey that song is old, but it is good. The first verse is very catchy, the chorus is really good and the second verse is very good.

The last verse just doesn't last long enough. I wish it was longer.

This is a good song. Not the best song on the album, but not bad.

One of my favorite songs on the album. I like the lyrics and the message. I also like that it is a song you can do it to. I like that it is a love song.

I like the song, but I just feel that the song would have been better with a bit more vocal harmonies and a bit more of a melody.

This song is not that great. I like the song, but I just feels that the song would have been much better with a bit more vocal harmony and a bit more of a chorus.

This is a good song. Not the greatest song on an album, but not bad.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have liked the first track on this album, but I haven't been able to get past the second one.  I'm not sure if it's me or if I need to re-listen to it.  It just doesn't fit in my world.  I'm not sure if it's me, or if I am just not a fan of the songs that are on this album.  It's like hearing the same thing over and over again and is boring.  I would rather hear something new and different, but this album is so predictable.  I think I'll give it another listen, but I won't purchase it.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a couple weeks now.  I really like the songs on it, but I am finding that I am just not into it.  All the songs have a similar structure, very repetitive and monotonous.  What's worse is that it seems like everyone else has heard the same songs over and over again, so I am not sure if this is just my personal taste, or what.  I am glad I listened to it, but this album is not for me.  I would rather listen to something new and different.

Amazon review: I am in love with this album.  I am not sure how I found out of the internet or if I had a friend who told me about it, but I am so happy to know I own this album!  I love the song "The End Is Near" by The New Pornographers.  It is exactly as I was hoping and more.  I love how the lyrics are so positive and hopeful, and how the song moves me and makes me think.  The song "I'm Not Afraid to Love" by New Young Pony Club is also wonderful, and I love the song "It's Time" by The Killers.  This album is so full of great songs.  I have listened to it more than 3 times and I am still having trouble with the first song.  It's the same song, but with different lyrics.  I am so excited to own this album, and I am happy I found out about it from my friend.

I would recommend this album to people who love folk and bluegrass.  I don't really like it, but I will still listen to it.

The following albums are available from Amazon.com as a Kindle eBook and in PDF:

1. Blood on the Dance Floor (Volumes 1-3) by Jello Biafra - Kindle eBook. This is an amazing album. The first three volumes were released on cassette, but these two volumes are the first time the songs were available as a complete collection.
2. Black Hole Sun by The Doors - Kindle eBook. This is the band's best album (except for maybe Dark Star.) At the time of its release, the Doors had already formed The Doors, and were already on tour, so this collection was not complete.
3. Blood on the Dance Floor Volume 3: Electric Wizard by Jello Biafra - Kindle eBook. This book contains a few songs from The Doors, including "When the Music's Over" and "Alligator."
4. The Screaming Skull by The Screaming Skull - Kindle eBook. This is the third volume of the collection by The Screaming Skull.
5. The Screaming Skull Volume 1: The Screaming Skull by The Screaming Skull - Kindle eBook. This book contains an interview with The Screaming Skull, who discusses the band's early days in California, and the release of their debut album, Freak Show.
6. The Screaming Skull Volume 2: The Screaming Skull by The Screaming Skull - Kindle eBook. The second volume of this collection, released three years after the first.
7. The Screaming Skull Volume 3: The Screaming Skull by The Screaming Skull - Kindle eBook. Volume three of the collection, released a year after the second volume.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

###
Amazon review: It's not a big deal, I just bought it and I'm not all that excited about it. I'm a fan of the rapper Eminem, and I just listened to the intro and outro of the album. I must say, it was rather entertaining. However, I feel that most of the music is very repetitive and could have used a little more variety. I'm not really sure what the point of the album is, but I'm still on the fence.

I have to say though that I like this album a lot. It's not that amazing, but it's not that bad.

Amazon review: I really like Eminem. I don't understand how this guy is the biggest rapper/singer in the world. He's not even that good of a rapper. I just don't understand. I really like him though.

A:

I don't know what the author is asking here, but it seems to me that he's asking which of the tracks from the album are on the Amazon video.
The video's description contains two lines:

In addition to the songs on this album, some of the tracks also appear on the second and third CDs of The Good Wife, which are available from Amazon.com.

I think it's quite clear that the author (and, by extension, Amazon) means the entire album.

 Since the second CD is only available as a separate item, the author is probably asking about the other tracks from the album.

A:

I'm not saying there are no track that are on the album, but I'd rather think that the author here is asking about the videos and not the other tracks.
If you click on a song from the video, it opens up a page with video and track information.
If you see a song that you're interested in, you should click the "More info" button at the bottom of the page to get a full track listing.

It's clear that the author is asking which of the tracks from the album are on the video. When you click on a song from the video it opens up a page with video and track information.
If you're interested in the song you should click the "more info" button after you hover over it to get a full track listing.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Manhattan Transfer is one of my favorite groups and Tuxedo Junction is one of my favorite songs.  Another great song by the group is A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  Can you tell I am an old timer.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: After several listenings of this CD I was hooked!  The album is full of great songs that I have never heard!    I liked "Just A Little" very much.  I like to listen to music that I know I will recognize, not songs that I find strange.  What made the most difference was the fact that I knew all of the songs by heart.    I bought it for my husband and my son and they loved it.  I like that I was able to buy an album that they could play on any of their CD players.    I look forward to enjoying his CD's as they come out!

Amazon review: I have been listening to jazz for a long time but I have found that there are many good songs on jazz albums that are not played often.  I was not familiar with this artist and had not heard of him until I saw him on the TV show Jazz at the Movies.  I decided to buy the album and listen to what I had heard.  I was delighted!  I think he will be one of my favorites.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: After listening to this CD, I decided to buy it.  It really is a wonderful album.  I was very impressed with the way he recorded the vocals.  The sound is very good.    I bought it for my husband and my son and I am glad I did.    I looked forward to listening to it.

I listen to jazz on the radio and this is a great album that I am ready to buy.

I bought it and have listened to the songs and would have given it a 5, but I am now looking for a way to get the album.    I have a CD player that I use for my car and I was hoping that I could get my CD player to play this CD.  I have a few other blues CDs that I purchased and would like to have them play on my car radio.    I would like to get this album but am unable to find a way to get it.  I am hoping that I can get my CD player to play this album and would be very grateful if someone could help me.  I really enjoy listening to great music and would appreciate being able to have it played on my car radio.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I love this kind of music, but have been looking for some of this artist's music.  I guess I had missed him.  I was just listening to some of his music one day and really liked it.    I have a CD player and was wondering if I could get some of his music from my CD player.  I have many blues CDs that I have purchased and would like to have them play on the CD player.    I have heard of this artist and I was looking forward to listening to his music.  I have also heard that this artist is a very good guitarist.  I love to play guitar and was hoping that I could get his music from my CD player.  I will be very grateful if someone could help me.  I really enjoy listening and would appreciate it very much.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

However, it is really hard for me to learn new songs.  This is the very reason I will not purchase this CD.  The singing is very low on this album, and I have been singing this way for over ten years.  This is not the way to sing for me.  This is not good for me.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: This is an excellent musical based on the film, but the score is not quite as good as the film.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I wish they would do more of the old school country rock, but their sound is on point and I'm proud of them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The first time I heard this album was on the radio when it was on the shortwave radio. My dad heard it and told me to check it out. I had never heard anyone really sing like this before. I have always loved country music, but have only ever listened to the country genre. I have tried to learn more about country music, but I have always had trouble understanding it.  This album changed all my perceptions on country music.  Although I think it has a very traditional sound, it has a twist that makes it unique and interesting.  It is a little dark at times, but I love it.  I wish the band would play more live shows and not so much of on the internet albums.  They are a great group and are having a great time playing music.

They are a great band.  I love the live shows they put on and I hope they will put on a show for me.  It seems like they have a following in the U.S.A.  I hate to see them go.  I hope this isn't the end of their career.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I didn't know this band existed until this album came out.  I was never into country music back in the day, so I had no idea there was people like this.  I had heard songs from this band, but never knew anyone was into country music.  I have listened to this album more and more.  I think this album is top-notch.  I am really happy Dallas Holm is doing what they are doing.  They are a great band.  I would love to see this band continue to play all over the world and get a chance to go see them play in front of a big crowd.  I hope they will record more and get more fans.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the fact that the band is a big hit in other countries.  They get a lot of airplay in Europe.  They have a very good following here in the U.S.  I have been a fan since I was a young teenager.  I am now 57 years old and I still love listening to this band.  I hope they continue to keep the same sound in the future.  I can't wait to see what the next album is going to sound like.

Amazon review: I had never heard much about this band before I heard their song "Love Is a Dog's Name" and then I came across this album.  This band is truly a band worth supporting.  I wish they would go out on tour.  They are a great band.  I was so glad to hear them on the radio when they did "The Red River Line."  I still love their songs "You Will See Me" and "I've Been Around."  I wish they would come out with another album soon.  I would love to see them play live.  I hope they will do more shows and record more new albums.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I've listened to a few of your albums. I found your music to be a little bland and uninspired. While you are right in that a lot of your songs are very good, I believe there was some bad songwriting on this album. The songs had a very generic, repetitive, and a bit boring sound to them. I believe that if you were to make a new album that is more exciting and energetic, it would be a definite improvement.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm a little bitter, because they didn't listen to my other CD. I played your CD on my home stereo and was in awe with the sound. I had some trouble with songs such as:  Let The Worshipers Arise  It's a shame that the CD was packaged in a very cheap looking jewel case. I'm not a huge fan of the jewel case, but I liked the CD-case so I thought I would give it a shot and play it. It was very disappointing. I'm guessing that the CD was in a more expensive jewel case that the CD-case. The quality of the CD sounded very poor, it seemed as if the CD was scratched a lot as well. It sounded very dull. I'm really not giving 5 stars because of the jewel case. I would only give it 1 star based on the quality of the CD.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
