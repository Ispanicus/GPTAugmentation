Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I listen to this CD a lot for my own relaxation and I can say that this is the best CD I have made so far.  It has only taken me about three weeks to learn the songs and the most important thing is that I have really found a new favorite.  It is a very relaxing CD, highly recommended.  The CD is an easy listen and you can dance to it while listening.  The CD is a mix of old and new songs.  The songs are arranged in sets which also helps.  The songs are also mixed in different styles but they are all in the same style which helps to create a new kind of listening feeling.  The songs are easy listening and are also very relaxing to listen.  I would recommend this CD to everybody.  I have a CD in my car and it also helps me to relax.  It is also great to listen to at the beach or at the park.  The songs are very mellow and the CD is very well-produced too.  I think that this is one of the best CDs I have made so far.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

It is different from the last one.  This is better.  I would have paid for this album if it were a little more expensive.  I am a music lover and I have been waiting for this album.

I like the new songs a lot, but I wish the album was about 2.5 times longer.  I would rather have a 2.5 times longer album than that.  This is a great album.  I think it will be a very big hit.

The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a disgrace to all who have ever had the privilege of listening to this great man. Not only did I buy this record to hear the new material but also to finally hear the old material the label had released. It was in this new material from this recording that I found what I was looking for. It is so raw it is painful to listen to. You can see the strain of this man who was at the end of his rope at the time of recording. The voice has lost all dignity and is a poor imitation of the original. This album is a disgrace to all who have listened to this man and to all that have ever had the opportunity to hear his voice.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a shame. The guy's voice was fantastic when it was younger, but this is a poor version of his songs. He is a very talented person but I was hoping for more quality at this point in life. I will be looking for a re-issue of his music in the near future.

Amazon review: The original music is great, and the music from this cd is not as good. He is a great singer, and he is a very talented musician.

Amazon review: I listened to this track a few times, and I could not get myself to really enjoy this song. It just doesn't do much for me. I am not a fan of this song, and I hope they don't re-release it. The guitar is great, but the vocals are not. When you listen to this song, you have to imagine what the original singer was doing. This is by far the worst version of this song I have ever heard.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a wonderful piece of music.  It's a simple piece that uses some of Beethoven's most powerful orchestral writing, and yet remains very interesting and a pleasure to listen to.  This recording of the piece was done by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and it uses the same recording techniques and techniques as their own recordings of the piece.  It's excellent!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a beautiful symphonic piece that could be a childrens lullaby.  The story is told in 3 short segments, each with its own story and an easy-to-listen to voice over that lets the listener know what the segment is about.  It's also a very pretty piece that will be a great addition to any home CD player.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I found this recording to be interesting and well done.  The recording was not perfect, but the instrumentation was pretty good.  The piano, strings, brass and percussion were all in good standing.  The voice was a little scratchy, but it was still a very pleasant listen.

Amazon review: I love this piece because of the beauty and complexity of it.  It is a beautiful piece of music that has a sense of unity that I think is very effective.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: One of the finest symphonies in existence, this recording is a superb tribute to Beethoven's genius.  It is a real joy to listen to.  The instrumentation is rich and richly expressive.  The strings are particularly great, and the piano is just lovely.  The performance is superb and the recording is superb.  I can't think of a better piece to listen to.

Amazon review: The first of three symphonies by Beethoven, which can be played as a concerto for a symphony orchestra or for soloists.  The first symphony was published in 1808.  It was re-published in 1816 and dedicated to Ludwig van Beethoven, the then-current director of the Vienna Conservatory.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This piece is a lovely piece of music written in 1803, when Beethoven was in his early twenties.  It is a beautiful piece, and was first published as a trio in 1816.  The first recording was done in 1827 with the Leipzig Gächinger Symphoniker.  The performance by the Gächinger Symphoniker and the recording by the Vienna Philharmonic are very good.  The recording is excellent and the performance is excellent.  The sound is very clear, with no hiss or distortion.

Amazon review: A beautiful, very interesting piece of music.  I've heard this piece called "Love's In The Heart Of The Moon," and I would have liked to have heard it called "Love's in the Heart of the Sun."  The title, as I understood it, was a reference to the way Earth and the Sun's light seem to be connected, but not actually.  It's a very pretty love song.  I don't know what the composer meant by "Love's in the Heart of the Sun," so I can't say how I feel about that title.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I have been a Fan of the Beatles since the early days and this is in my opinion the best collection of Beatles that I have ever heard! The only thing I do not like is that there seems to be a lot of Beatles covers. I do not understand why they have to have a lot of Beatles covers. It seems like they are trying to sell more and more stuff. I would be happy to pay to get the complete Beatles as a CD that only has the Beatles.

The cover is beautiful and I'll definitely get that one.  But this one is on my list of songs I need to listen to.  Just not this one to me.  I love all of her albums but this one is a little below my radar.  I'm probably going to get my friend to send it to me.  So let me just say I'm definitely not buying this one.

Amazon review: This is a new Bonnie Tyler CD.  I listen to both her albums on repeat all day.  This is the first one I've listened to and the song sounds different.  I like the song, but I don't like that the song is sung in a different style.  I wish this was an album with more songs, but I like a good mix of songs on an album.  If you listen to the radio station in your city, they play one song constantly.  I guess I have to buy all of her albums, I guess I'll get this one first.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this band...and all their songs.  "The World" is in my top 5.  I hope they make it on the cover.  I'll take them out to dinner and order one "gatorade."  Thanks for the memories                *hugs*

Amazon review: I have two great favorites on my iPod: "New Day" and "Pump Up the Volume." If you want to know why I love them so much, look at this:
"Pump Up the Volume"  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4bBj7V8CZ4)
"New Day"  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7iZy_2W9Yc)

Amazon review: What a treat.  I've listened to both songs from the album, "The World" and "Pump Up the Volume" a few times now and I love them both.  I don't know why I've never heard of this band before, but this is a good example of "what I like" and what I like is different than what I like.  The songs are simple, and they are very catchy and enjoyable to listen to, but there is something about the sound that I really love.  I think it's the same thing that I love about the other songs on the album, but I don't know.  I think I like it for the same reason I like "The World": it's simplicity and it sounds great.  I get that this is a cover, but I still love it.  I love the song "Pump Up the Volume" as well, but I'm not sure that I understand it as well.  I think I like this song because I'm a fan of John Mayer and because it's a "jangly, jangly" song.  It's not too over the top, and it's not too boring.  It's like a good jangly, jangly, jangly, jangly, jangley song.  That's what I like about it.  It's like "the one and only"  But I don't know if I like it because I like John Mayer or because it's jangly.  I love "The World" and "Pump Up the Volume" together, but only because they are both simple songs.  You don't have to say "I love you" or "I'm sorry" or any of the typical "good old fashioned" lyrics.  They are just songs that are good to listen to while you're driving around or while you're walking in the park.  The songs go by in a way that's very pleasant.  They are both easy to listen to, and I think it's a great combination of both.  I also really like the cover of "The World" on the album, "Pump Up the Volume."  I think it's a good contrast to the album version.               **love this song**

Amazon review: I like this song.  It's a good song.  But it really doesn't sound like the band that made it.  It's very much like "The World" without being "The World."  The vocals don't match up too well, and the bass isn't the same.  There are other songs on the album that sound similar, but "The World" and "Pump Up the Volume" sound more like each other.  The songs are pretty simple, but they are very catchy.              **Love "The World"**
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like the album, "The World." The song "Pump Up the Volume" is great, too.  The songs are simple and fun, and I like them.  There are a few different versions, and I like all the ones on the album.  I like "New Day" and "The World" better than the album version of "Pump Up the Volume."  I think the album version is better, because it's more dramatic, but as I said, the others are good, too.              *great album*

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was a huge fan of Jewel's first two albums, so I was very excited to receive this one.  All 5 tracks here are very good, but the last two,  "The Greatest Love of All" and "Love Can Make a Mess," rank very high on my list of Jewel's best songs.  I listened to the whole CD in one sitting, and I was completely blown away by the diversity of the lyrics, from the hopeful and poetic to the heavy and emotionally raw.  The production is clear and crisp and the production values are top notch.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: i like hammond organ, enjoyed sound of late Jon Lord' Hammond, but this album has too many different keyboards up front and guitars are burried behind. unfortunately, Steve Morse repeating himself  and his riffs and solos are too predictable. I love this band. one of the best live bands. enjoyed last album, but this one doesn't work for me
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan of Jewel's for years.  I love her voice and she's a great artist.  This new CD is much better than the last, but that doesn't mean it's a good record.  You have to listen to it to decide for yourself.  I love the music and love the voice, but I could never see getting to the bottom of that mystery behind the songs.  It's so frustrating and disappointing.  I feel like I'm missing something, but what?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A strong contender for the best live music CD of the year.  In a time when many musicians seem to be trying to emulate the sound of jazz, I think Jewel has created a sound that is uniquely her own.  She has a very strong voice and a great grasp of the music she creates.  This CD is worth the price of admission alone.  It's a must-have for any fan of Jewel and jazz.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really enjoy this album and like the sound of it.  Very good for the price, but not very good at all for the listening experience.  I would have liked a little bit more variety in the music.  If you like jazz or just like the sound of Jewel, you can't go wrong with this CD.  I can't give it five stars because it's not a great listening experience.  It's not bad, but it's not the best.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you have a few hours to spare and you're just a fan of Jewel, you should give this album a listen.  I guess that's the point of an album like this.  I liked some of it and a couple of songs were a bit disappointing.  I wouldn't call it a bad CD though.  A good album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: For the most part this is a good album.  I liked the cover of her new CD and the sound of the new songs.  It was a good listen.  I wish that the songs were a bit longer.  I don't think this album will be around for a long time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A really solid album that stands up to the excellent songs and vocals of Jewel's previous albums.  If you like jazz, you really have to give this a listen.  It's hard to describe just what a great album this is, but it's definitely worth a listen.

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  It's not an easy listen, and it's not my favorite on the CD, but I will definitely be listening to this album more than I have listened to any other Jewel CD.  I love the songs and I love the sound of her voice.  It's a good album.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

I enjoyed this album when it came out, but after its release I found that I didn't really like it anymore.  I had the same thing happen with The Pixies too.  It's not really a matter of whether I liked this album or not, but I thought it was too much of a throwaway album compared to the other albums by the same band.  The Pixies are a great band and I enjoy their music, but this album doesn't have the same depth.

###
Amazon review: I like this record, but I wish the liner notes had been longer.  The songs are well written.  The only problem is that the lyrics don't really explain what is going on musically.  I think that the band is a little too influenced by some of the music that they grew up listening to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was waiting for a CD of this quality and I thought it would be good.  It gets better with each listen.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the album.  Some of the songs are very short-but they have a great groove and feel.  The best song "R.a.m.e" is a great way to end the album.  I really don't know why this is one of the best albums I've listened to in a long time.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the best album on the band's career.  The band has always had a great song list, but this album is more than that.

They have so many great songs but the one that stands out to me is "The Gift".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was a little skeptical at first, but I've found that this CD has one of the best soundtracks of the year.  This is the same album that got me into the band in the first place, so I just had to buy it.  The only problem is that it didn't come with a case.  I'm not sure what I'll do about it.  I think I'll just turn it up and enjoy the CD.

If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.
