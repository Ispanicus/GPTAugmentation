Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: So good to hear a Slipknot song again!  This was a great album with a lot of energy.  Good songs like "All the Small Things" and "I've Seen It All" are worth a listen.

Amazon review: I am very disappointed in this album.  This is a great song, and a great album.  It has songs on there that just don't make any sense at all.  I listen to it over and over again and still don't get it.  I really like this album, it's just that the songs are just not what I am used to listening to.  It sounds like something outtah a radio station, I don't like it.  I am just hoping Slipknot will come out with something new, just listen to this album for a while and you will get used to it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really surprised at how well this album sounds.  I've been a big fan of Slipknot since 1991 and I love this album.  I really like the songs I have heard so far and the album is really good.  The only negative thing about this album is that it starts so fast, it takes you out of the song.  I like that it does that because it makes it a little more realistic.  Overall, this is a great album and it really makes you think about what's really important in life.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this album numerous times and still it is one of the best albums by this band.  Even after all these years I can still think of songs, and listen to songs that I couldn't even remember listening to back then.  It is still really good and I really like every song on this album.  I think this album is still worth buying, but the best songs are those that you can't even remember.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a nice album and I like it, but I can't help but laugh at all the "Rhodes piano" on the cover and the cheesy piano intro on the first song.  The first song is over 5 minutes long and the lyrics are just plain annoying.  Just a bunch of "Rhodes" and "cheese" and "noise."  I love the song "All I Want for Christmas" as it's a great Christmas song and it's catchy, but the song has the same "cheese" piano intro that is just annoying.  I just wish they would have come up with a version for the CD that wasn't cheesy.  Now that I have the CD, I don't feel like listening to it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I found the CD to be a very interesting CD.  I don't like the songs and I don't like the cover.  I'm not a Christian.  It's not a Christian CD.  It's a cheesy CD.  I can't listen to it more than once. I didn't know much about this artist before I bought this CD.  I am not going to buy her CDs anymore.  They are all cheesy.  I don't think I will have anything more to do with her now.  I bought this CD for the cover and the songs but when I got it I realized that this is not a good CD. I don't like the songs.  I don't like the cover. This was a waste of money.  I'll never buy this CD again.

Amazon review: The song "I'm a Child" is very nice.  The song "I Don't Want to Cry" is an interesting song.  "All I Want for Christmas" is a very good song.  "Ride On" is a very good song.  The rest of the songs are not very good.  "For the First Time" is a very good song.  "When the Money's Gone" is a nice song.  "Song for the Lonely" is a very nice song.  All of the songs are very nice but the music is not very good.  I like the music.  The CD is okay.  Definitely worth the money but definitely not worth the CD.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: This was one of the songs that got me through a terrible breakup. I heard this song and I cried so hard it took me a while to calm down. It's like I was watching someone else's life. It's not just a song about the pain of a break up, this song is about the pain that it can cause you.

Amazon review: This song was my first song that I actually sang to my boyfriend (as he was in the Army). He's my boyfriend, and I've never been in a relationship where I felt like I could finally express myself for once and this song made me feel like I could. I'm not a very good singer, and this song really helped me out. This song was the first song I heard that made me believe in myself, and that I could be someone else, and express myself. I feel like it was one of those things, when you really want to express yourself, that just makes you feel so good, and so confident in yourself.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song has been a very big help to me. There are a couple of songs I really like and this is one of them. I'm not much of a singer, but this song really helped me out.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review:  Well, it's Christmas music, so I'm not going to complain.  I do wish they'd done something more with it.  The first song, "Christmas Time Is Here" is a nice song that seems to have been taken from a carol.  The second song, "Christmas in the Air" is one of the weakest ones, but it is done in a funny and pleasant way.  The song "Christmas with The Best of You" is very nice, although it seems to be about a very young girl who seems to be a little bit lost in herself.  "Away in a Manger" is a very well-done Christmas song.  It's a nice little song, but the main singer sings it like a man.  "Silent Night" is very nice and is probably the best song on the CD.  I just wish they'd done something with the rest of the songs.  They could have made a nice Christmas album.  This is nice, but it's too easy.  It lacks the punch and the energy of a real Christmas album.

But I just can't help but think of it as a sort of holiday CD for the masses.  It's not going to grab you by the ear or anything, but it does the job.  This CD is very nice.  I'll be buying more of it.  I like Christmas music, and I like this CD.

Amazon review: I was so disappointed when I first heard this.  I really wanted to like it, but the first two songs made me feel like it was all too easy.  The next two songs made me feel that the first two were just the beginning.  They didn't even need to be on the CD.  They just needed to be played as background music.  So I gave up.  I was really hoping it would kick in a little more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with you about the tracks being too easy, but I believe that they are designed to be played in the background during your Christmas parties.  I think the reason they are so easy to play is that they are all very simple and simple melodies.  The only exception is "Christmas Time Is Here."  That is a very complex song.  No matter how hard you try, you simply cannot play that song on a piano.  It's very complex.  You're just not prepared to play it on a piano.  It's a tough song.

A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: Nancy Sinatra spent over 30k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault!  She should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon.

Amazon review: The first half of this album is pretty good, but the second half is so-so.  The album's best track is "I Don't Wanna Fight" (a song I heard on NPR, so I knew it was good).  The rest of the tracks are pretty average.  The worst track is "In a Nutshell" (it's the same song as "I Can't Hear You", but sung slightly differently by a different artist with different vocal chords and phrasing).  I don't know if it's the same song or not, but I had to include it because of how similar it is to the song "I Don't Wanna Fight" (and I thought it was a good song, so I had to include it).  There are two other songs, "I Don't Wanna Fight" and "In a Nutshell" that are not worth listening to at all.  The two songs I do like are "Dirty Little Secrets" and "The World Today".  Dirty Little Secrets is a really sweet song, and the lyrics to "The World Today" are pretty sweet as well.  I enjoyed this album a lot.  I just think it's overall a bit underwhelming.  If you are a fan of Sinatra, you should give it a go.  Otherwise, you probably won't enjoy it.

Amazon review: This song is amazing!  I am a huge fan of the band, and this song is extremely powerful and beautiful.  It is a great song and very different from their previous material.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.

Amazon review: This is a good song.  Good songwriters and good musicians.  Too bad the song doesn't fit with the overall theme of the album.  I don't know what the point was.  You don't have to like the song - just listen to the other songs.

Amazon review: I just don't get this song.  Nothing about the song is worth the price of admission, and I would definitely not be buying this to support the band because if the song is this bad, they are going to loose all credibility.  So, I guess I'm just not going to waste my money on the album.

Amazon review: This is the last song on the album and the song is really really good.  It's upbeat and it fits the theme of the album nicely.  The song is actually kind of catchy.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

This is an album that you can listen to over and over and over again.  It's got everything that you could want from a rock album.  The writing is great.  The music is great.  The vocals are great.  The production is solid.  But, what makes the album is the sheer depth of emotion that it captures on every song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm a big fan of Slipknot's work.  Not just because I'm a fan of the music on their albums, but because I'm a fan of the character of Corey Taylor.  I was in the middle of listening to Slipknot's latest album "Slipknot" when I decided to switch to something else to listen to.  This is what I was listening to:
"For Those Who Wait"  A great album, but not something I would typically listen to.  However, this was a song that grabbed me.  It's a song that I've listened to in the last couple of weeks and as soon as I heard it, I knew that I needed to listen to it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I've been a fan of Slipknot since I first heard their first album "Slipknot."  I've listened to most of their albums repeatedly, and I've never really heard anything like this one.  It's a great alternative to the usual "rock" type of music, which is what I like.  However, I don't know if it's a real alternative or just what Slipknot fans want to hear.  It's not what I would classify as a "rock" album because it's mostly pop-rock.  It's not a "metal" album because there are no metal songs on it.  Although the drumming has a metal feel to it, it's not what I would consider metal.  It's not a "country" album because they do a lot of harmonies, but the vocals aren't really that country.  It's not a "hard rock" album because it doesn't have that heavy sound to it.  It's not a "heavy metal" album because it doesn't have the harshness of a lot of "heavy metal" albums.  It's not a "progressive" album because it doesn't have that extreme sound of a lot of "progressive" albums.  I could go on and on, but I don't want to bore you.  This is a great album, but not something that I would typically listen to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a pretty good album in my eyes.  This is my first choice of songs to put on my iPod.  This is my favorite album on the iPod.  It's not Slipknot's best album, it's just a great album.

###
Amazon review: A great album, but not something I would typically listen to.  This is my first choice of songs to put on my iPod, but I don't know how many songs are on here.  Slipknot is a pop-rock band.  This album has a number of songs from their previous albums, in addition to a few newer songs.  I don't know if it's a good or bad thing.  This is just another album that I don't know if I should or shouldn't put on my iPod.  I think it has great songs, but it doesn't have the best songs of all of Slipknot's albums.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  The album was good.  It has a number of songs from their previous albums, in addition to a couple of newer songs.  I like the sound of the music, but I don't like the song choices.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I just wanted to give you a quick review before I take my mind off of it. I listened to this album for the first time yesterday, and I was pleasantly surprised. Everything on there sounds great. The songs are great and the vocals are awesome. When I first heard the album, I thought it was amazing, and I have been listening to it non-stop ever since. I would have to say that I'm going to buy it again, and I'll probably go back to it a second time and re-listen to it again.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Very good song. I like how you have the words "just a little time" and "I don't know why" in the song without the use of the word "just". I also like how the song starts off with the line "I'm not going anywhere" which makes it easy to not have an emotional attachment to the song.

Amazon review: I'm really enjoying this song. It has a very powerful message about the nature of true love and the importance of family.

It's so powerful and speaks volumes to those who truly know what it's like to lose a loved one.

Amazon review: I like this song. I find it really powerful, but not sure if I'd actually want to listen to the song. I don't think I would say that I think this song is a hit or a flop, but this one is a great song but I don't think I'd want to listen to it. I don't listen to many pop songs that are like this, and I don't know if I would want to listen to it.

Amazon review: I found this song very interesting. It's a song about the power of true love, but I found the lyrics to be a little dull. The message was good. The vocals were very good, but that can be attributed to the amazing music that has been put out. I loved how she was able to sing many different parts. I liked the way she incorporated the word "love" to the "Hot Space" message. I really liked the "Hot Space" song. The music video is the best part. I like how the video shows her as a young girl from the beginning, to the end, and it shows her as an adult.
