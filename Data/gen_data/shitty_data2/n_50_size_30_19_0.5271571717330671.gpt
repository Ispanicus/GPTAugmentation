Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: This CD is definitely for die-hard fans of her. This CD is a must have. I love the fact that she's making a new album.  I don't know how many songs were written for the album, but I'm guessing there were at least 5 or 6 songs.  I'm not going to lie, I love when she sings.  I just think there are way too many other songs on this CD.  A lot of her songs are about relationships and personal things.  I think a lot of people will enjoy this CD.  It's a nice change from her traditional song style.  I just don't think I will like this CD.

Amazon review: Thalia is the best!  Thalia has a voice that is absolutely beautiful and she has a great personality.  I have been looking for a CD of Thalia's music for years and have finally found it.  Thalia has a voice that is totally unique and unlike any other Latin performer.  I have heard only one CD of Thalia's music and I have to say I was really impressed with it.  Thalia is a good singer and a really good person.  She seems sincere and doesn't seem to be interested in becoming famous. I am very impressed with Thalia and I would recommend this CD to anyone. I am sorry, I can't give 5 stars because I don't think it is worth it.  I would not give 5 stars because it is not worth the money.  I love the voice that Thalia has and I don't think she is an attention seeker.  I don't think Thalia is going to write her own songs.  I don't think she has any musical talent.  I think she is a very talented singer but I just don't think she is any better than any other singer out there.  I am not impressed with this CD.  I have heard all of Thalia's CDs and it is very hard for me to choose between her recordings and not listen to other recordings.  I have already bought the cd and I will make sure I have it in my cd player or in my car when I am driving.  I cannot wait to get to the concerts of Thalia.  I am very excited about this CD.

Amazon review: Manhattan Transfer is one of my favorite groups and Tuxedo Junction is one of my favorite songs.  Another great song by the group is A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  Can you tell I am an old timer.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a nice, well recorded recording of a group known for their performances on television.  It does not attempt to sound like the group, but it does attempt to sound as close as possible to the group. The sound is excellent.  My only complaint is that there are some noises that are too quiet and others that are too loud.  This is a good recording.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD is not as good as the other CD's I have been listening to.  The sound is clear and the performance is good.  However, the sound quality is not up to par with many of the other CDs I have heard.  I was surprised that I didn't have any problems with the CD.  I do have a CD of the group called "Tuxedo Junction" that I have been listening to for over a year now.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A lot of people say that this is the best of the group, but I disagree.  I would rather listen to the group with a good sound system than listen to this CD.  The sound is very good, but it does not compare with the sound of other recordings of the group.  The instruments are clear and the voices are clear as well.  I would say that this is the group's best CD.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band for a long time,  but I didn't know they could do what they did with a song.  I don't know how they did it.  I have been using their songs on my own CD for the past few years,  but have been looking for a good CD that I could use in church. I found this one.  I will be using it to preach the gospel,  and as many songs as you would ever listen to in church,  and I will be using the CD to prepare for ministry.

Amazon review: I have been searching for a Christian CD for a long time.  I have heard of this band but have never been able to listen to their music until now.  I think this album will be different then any of the other Christian CDs out there.  I have not heard  much in the way of Christian music on the Internet. However, it seems they are a band who are very different from the Christian music out there.  I have been using their songs for my worship services for the past couple of years.  I love that they have written a song that can be used for so many different things.  I am looking forward to using this CD in church.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Green Day since they started. I would like to recommend this album to someone in the future.

I am a happy person. I have not been happy in a very long time. This is a very emotional song, I am not very happy. We are supposed to be happy I think. I am not happy. The song is very good, but I don't like the song as much as the first one. I think a little more emotion will make the song good. The second one is like a happy song, the first one is the song of a person who is sad. I think the first one is the song of a person who is happy. I think the two songs are very different. I would like to recommend this album to someone in the future. I am not sure if I will. I don't think I will. I am not sure I will. I don't think I will. I don't think I will. I don't think. I don't think. I don't think I will. I don't think.

I think this album is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I love the music of Green Day. I have heard a lot of music and this is the best I have heard. I think a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but they are wrong. I am not sure if I will buy it or not. I don't think I will. I don't think I will buy it. I don't think I will. I don't think I will and I am not sure I will. I don't think I will. It is good,

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with this reviewer.  It was one of the best Christmas albums I have heard.  They played Christmas music (and played it well) and I was very impressed with the musicianship and song selection.  I will admit that I didn't listen to it all the way through.  I probably should have.  But I really enjoyed the first two songs on the album, "A Little Bit of Christmas" and "Christmas In December."  I was impressed with the arrangements and the voices of "A Little Bit of Christmas" and "Christmas In December."  The lead singing was not as strong on the second album (which I think had a lot of overdubbing).  I liked the vocals on their first album better.  I just wish they had included "Christmas In December" in the DVD.  I hope that was included on CD #2.  I heard a couple of the songs from the CD.  I like "A Little Bit of Christmas" and "This Little Light of Mine."  I really like "A Little Bit of Christmas" and didn't like "Love Me Tender."  I thought "Love Me Tender" was one of the weaker songs on the album.  On the Christmas in December album, I liked "Winter Wonderland," "Winter Wonderland," and "Christmas In December."  What a fantastic album and CD.  I really enjoyed it.  The music and lyrics are fantastic.  I would recommend this album to anyone.  It's a fun, relaxing listen.  I would have liked to have heard more Christmas songs on the CD.  The cover is very nice.  I don't know what happened with this CD.  I would have liked to have received the CD in a timely manner.  Thank you for the information.

Amazon review: This is the best Christmas CD I have ever heard.  I have bought every CD, CD, DVD, or Blu-Ray that Mumford has ever released.  I love this band. I hope this album will go to hell.  I will buy a CD from the band as soon as I receive it.  I have been buying Mumford for years, and this is my favorite Christmas album.  I bought this CD when they were a real band, and I was thrilled when I heard a few of the tracks on it.  It's my favorite CD in the history of CD/DVD/Blu-Ray/Blu-Ray/MP3 albums.  I bought the CD from the "Christmas in December" DVD.  I was so excited when I heard it.  I was so excited to hear it on this album.  The songs are fantastic, and I could listen to them all day.  I was especially impressed with "A Little Bit of Christmas" and "Winter Wonderland."  They played them perfectly.  I loved the arrangements, the singing, the musicianship, and the lyrics.  This is probably the best Christmas album I have ever heard.  I'm not sure why people hate on Christmas albums.  You should hear what I've heard.  I listen to this album constantly.  It's my favorite album.  It's the best CD I've ever heard.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Christmas music.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was so disappointed when I heard this CD.  I have been listening to your music for over 20 years.  I am very disappointed.  The CD has nothing going for it.  I have to disagree with this reviewer.  I have listened to this CD so many times.  It is not bad.  I did not like it when I first heard it.  Then, I listened to it with my wife and I liked it.  However,  we have listened to it so many times that it is now on my CD player.  I have a hard time listening to it.  At times, it is pleasant, but at others, it is not.  Many times it is just plain boring.  You need to add some more variety to your music.  It is just boring.  I have been waiting for this CD for years.  I would have bought it if you had just added a few songs to it.  It would have made it a better CD.  But, you are not the ones that asked me to buy it.  I have purchased many CDs from you.  I have purchased several of your CDs.  I have listened to them over and over again.  Then, I bought this CD.  I am now listening to it more than I did the first time.  You can't just write a review that says everything that goes through your mind when you hear a CD.  I hope that you will give the CD another chance.  I will buy it again.  I will listen to it when I am at my CD player.  I will listen to it whenever I am in my car.  I will listen to it whenever I am driving.  I will listen to it when I am walking down the street.  I will listen to it anytime I am in my car.  You need to give me another chance.  I love your music.  I hope that you will give me another chance.

There are some good songs on the album.  I have listened to it over and over again.  However, there are a few songs that are just not very good.  I can't say that all of them are bad.  It is just that, as a whole, it is not very good.  It is not a good CD.  It is not a good album.  It is just an average CD.  It is average in every way.  You guys are really missing the mark.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I find that most of these young people are just a bunch of wannabes. They'll try to put the best sound track they can to a movie, video, television or video game. They'll put their own music on a sound track. But when they come to a recording studio to record their song, they'll put on the best voice they can. They'll put on the best guitar player they can. They'll put on the best drummer they can. They'll put on the best bass player they can. They'll put on the best singer they can. They'll put on the best song writer they can. And then they'll put on their own personal sound track. But they will not put the right mix of instruments and voices. They'll put on their own personal sound track. And they'll put on their own personal sound track. And they'll put on one or two instruments that they think they should have on the sound track. But they won't put on any instruments that they think they should not have on the sound track. They will not put on any instrument whatsoever that they think is a waste of time. And when they record their song, they'll record it to a cassette player that has a cassette tape that is 1/8 inch thick. And they'll record their song to a cassette player

I'm not sure I understand the problem with this song.  It does sound like it is about a woman who is in a relationship with someone who is not her husband.  But it doesn't sound like the woman really is in a relationship with someone who is not her husband.  It is more like she is in a relationship with someone she doesn't really know.  It is about a relationship where the woman is a psychopath.  And the woman who is in the relationship is a woman that is actually a psychopath.  I agree with the other reviewers.  I think it is kind of lame that this woman is singing about how much she loves her husband, and that she hates the woman in the relationship.
