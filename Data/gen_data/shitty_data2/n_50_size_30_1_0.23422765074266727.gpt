Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: There is not a lot of information on this album, but it sounds very good.  It is not a super-cheesy album, but it is very polished and has a very good sound.  I like many of the recordings from this album, especially the ones with The O'Jays.  Some of the songs are new to me, and the ones that show the band at their best are "I've been Everywhere" and "So Long, Baby"  These songs are very good to have on the CD.

The only problem with the album is that the CD is not so durable.  It does not last as long as the CD that I am using now.

Amazon review: I like the music on this CD.  I can't think of any bad songs or singers.  I like the "Ride of a lifetime" song and the "I've been everywhere" song.  I like the "Oh My Lord" song and the "I could sing a song" song.  There are some really great songs and some really bad songs.  I really like the "I've been everywhere" song and "So Long, Baby" song and "You better believe it!".  There is a really good singer on this CD.  I have heard her sing in many concerts and I like her voice.  I did not know she was a singer until I bought this album.  I think that she is not as good as Della Reese, but she is a really good singer.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Very good review, I listened to it several times. I think Danzig is one of the best singers in metal. He has been working on this album for a few years now and I think it is one of his best.

If you are looking for a song to help you relax, check out the track "Frozen in Time." I like it because it's a little slower and has a nice guitar sound. It's an easy choice if you're looking for soothing music.

I don't usually like Danzig

I have listened to it a few times and I find myself listening to the songs over and over again. My husband, on the other hand, is not too impressed with the lyrics and has asked me to stop listening to "Lamb of God." This album is for everyone, however, and for the ones that will be offended by the lyrics. This album is a great addition to my library of Christian music. It certainly doesn't make me a better Christian, but it sure does make me a better person.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

The instructor, Cyney Davis is not only a very,very talented musician, but a great person as well.  I feel that I can truly learn and grow through her.  I have a couple of my own CDs to listen to, and one of the greatest things is when I can really hear what I'm doing wrong and how to improve.  Even through the awkwardness, she just gets me to be better!  I'd definitely recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: Another of my favorites,  I like how she does her breathing exercises in the middle of the song.  She does this in a soft voice, and it is so relaxing.  I think it is the best way to get the most out of a CD.  This is a CD I would listen to on my own (or with someone else) over and over.  I would have been very happy with a CD that I would listen to alone.  This is my first time singing so I don't have the skill yet.  I just like to hear myself sing.  I am sure that with continued practice, it will improve.  There are a lot of nice little features on this CD,  and I am sure that it will make the most out of anyone's practice time.  I like that she can sing "I want to go home" to "Goodbye" on the same note.  I don't have my own CD yet,  but I'm going to get one soon.  I just hope that it has a great sound!

Amazon review: In the beginning of this song, it says "I'm gonna be a cowboy when I grow up, and I'm gonna get a gun and a horse", the end of the song says "I'm gonna be a cowgirl when I grow up".  How is that supposed to make sense?

Amazon review: I have heard this song many times.  It is well sung and the lyrics are very good.  The first time I heard it I liked it because the beat was really good and the song was well written.  This song is a good song to use when you are feeling bad and depressed.  I have seen this song in videos on YouTube.  It is really hard to sing the song in the video.  It is boring and I don't like the song.  I will not be listening to this song again.  I will not buy it.  I will not buy the CD.  I will not buy the MP3.  I will not buy the DVD.  I will not buy the cassette.  I will not buy the cassette.  I will not buy anything.  If I could I would go to Mexico and live the life of a borracho.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: They are so much better live than they are on this album.  The band is tight, the musicianship is superb, the vocals are very good, the arrangements (or lack there of) are excellent.

Amazon review: I have been playing this CD since it came out over a year ago.  I have always been impressed by the instrumentation and this CD is no exception.  The songs are all very good and the orchestra is very professional.   The music is always very upbeat, but the lyrics and vocals are very sad.     The CD is very versatile, it doesn't just work as a dance CD, but it also works as a classical music album.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

If you're a fan of Twiztid, there's no doubt in my mind that you will love this album.  If you're not a fan, then you're probably not going to like this album either.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: The album has a lot of nice melodies and  the sound is great.  I've heard a lot of great jazz and this album is no exception.  I'm not sure if it's a jazz album, I guess it is because I like jazz so much. (I listen to a lot of jazz - some of it is quite good.)   The one song that didn't sound like anything else on the album was "I'm Back in Town" and it's a ballad.  The rest of the songs are good.   I wish I could play the piano.  I just can't touch a piano.       (I'm a pianist for ten years, but I didn't know I could play piano until recently)
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I got this album on a whim, after I saw the TV show "Sugar & Spice" and they had this album I liked so  much.  It is a very enjoyable album.  The album is not as deep as some of the other albums  that I have had, but it has a nice sound to it.  I would recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review:  I love the music of  Bob Dylan.  I love the blues,  but I don't know if I would call him a bluesman.  He is more in the jazz (or blues) genre.  I really don't know what to think.    Bob Dylan is one of my favorite  musicians ever.  I just want to tell him I love him.  He is a great musician, he has such a way with words.   I like his albums like "The Basement Tapes" and "John Wesley Harding."  I like his songs like "Highway 61 Revisited" and "Mr. Tambourine Man."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for a few months and it has become one of my favorite CDs.  The songs are all very different, yet each one has a unique sound and I love it.   The sound is pretty good and I don't have any complaints about it.        I like the fact that the music is at times loud and in other times soft.  I like the fact that it is all on one CD and the songs are not too long.  It is just right.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who would like a really good sounding CD.

Amazon review: I bought this album a few months ago.  I think it is the best album that I have ever had the pleasure to listen to.

These are the best.   They are worth their price.  I would recommend this album to anyone.

I thought that it would be so-so.   It is a very different type of  music.   I like the sound  and the recording is good.           I don't think that there is a single song on this  album that I didn't like.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: A great debut. It's very hard to say if this is a sophomore slump, but it's pretty close. I can't find much wrong with it, except for the vocals and the fact that there is so much filler.

Amazon review: This is probably one of the first rap albums I've ever purchased, but I still don't think it's good. I think it's a little too much of a crossover album.

Amazon review: This album is definitely one of the worst of the year. I had to stop listening after about the second song because there was so much filler and it was just horrible.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

When I first heard this song, I felt completely overwhelmed, but by the end I just wanted to hug Danzig.  I like this song because this song is about being the best and feeling worthless.  It is sooo true to how I feel, and I don't want to feel like that anymore.  I want to be the best, even if I am not.  I hope you all enjoy this song because I love Danzig and this song.  Thank you.

Amazon review: It's a good song, but it needs to be a lot better. This is one of the worst songs I have ever heard.  The lyrics are just about all wrong.

If this song was made by a normal band, I would say it was a hit.  But that just seems like a bad thing to me.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
