Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I purchased the mp3 but could not download it.  I was charged and when I contacted them they told me to try it again.  It doesn't work and all the things they told me to do to fix it I had ALDREADY told them I had done previous to contacting them.  They were no help and I am out.99 (big deal) but still have no song.

Amazon review: you can tell this is not an original, buy the dubbing and sound quality.  I have and original jim Stafford album from the 70s and this is not the same  ouality of sound. sucks this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from England,

Amazon review: I bought this album when it was released, and I loved it! But i was disappointed in the song "it's ok" by kylie jenner. when i first heard this song i thought it was the best song of the year.  Until I listened to it again and it turned out to be one of the worst songs of the year.  And it's not even a good song.  I think this band should have been on this album instead of "it's ok".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have this on my phone and love it.  I bought the album when it came out, but i did not like any of the songs on it.  I really did not like the song "bad girl" by the band The B-52's.  "bad girl" is one of the worst songs that i've ever heard.  It has so bad lyrics and sounds like something you would hear in a karaoke bar.  I hate the song and i will not listen to it ever again.  And i would not buy any more of this album.  The album is really overrated.  I would actually rather listen to the new songs that they put on the next album that i would never listen to.  I think its a waste of time for the fans of this band and waste of money for the record company.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've heard this song on the radio often. it's one of my favorite songs.  I've never heard it from the band, but I think it's one of my favorite songs ever.  It's a great song, and they should re-record it. It's a great song and should be a hit.  Anyway, I'm not a big fan of this album.  I don't know why they didn't put this song on the next album.  I think this song is important and should have been on the next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm going to make a comment here about this album, but it should be something I say as a guy who is a fan of the band.  I've never heard of this band.  But now I have, and I wish they would do more than just this album.  I love the songs, and I love the band.  But they have done an awful lot of things this year that I wish they would do more.  The things I like so far is that they've done a lot of hits this year and that they put this song on their next album.  But I wish they would do more.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this song, and I think it's one of the best songs ever.  But the album is horrible, and I don't understand why they didn't do a new album this year. I would like to see them doing a new album and do many songs that aren't on their last album. I like "see you again" and "no more crying" the best, but i don't know why they didn't do a new album with them.  I think they should do a new album this year and put this song on it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this album, but I'm disappointed in some of the songs.  "she's a bad girl" has a really awkward beat and the lyrics are very weird.  "bad girl" is one of my favorites, but I don't know why they didn't do a different album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love when I have a good feeling about a new record, but there are some songs that are disappointing.  The song "no more crying" by the band "The B-52's" is one of my favorites, but I would've liked to have heard other songs.  And the song "goodbye cruel world" by the band "The B-52's" is one of the worst songs ever.  It's depressing, and it doesn't have a strong enough chorus to be a hit.  And "see you again" by the band "The B-52's" is one of their weakest songs of 2009.  It's just a lame song with poor lyrics.  And "bad girl" by the band "The B-52's" is one of, if not the worst, song of the year.  It's just not a good song.  And they should have put a different song on their next album.  I would've liked to have heard more songs like that.  But I love the band so much, and I would have liked to hear more new music from them.

The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.

I am not a huge fan of Josh Colquhoun, but I've bought his albums at least 3 times in my life and I like them all as much as I like his voice. This is one of my favorites. It's a great pop/rock album, with a couple of great songs, like the song "I Love You" and the song "You Are Everything." His voice is awesome, and I enjoy his voice. I haven't had a chance to listen to this in a while, but I have heard it on the radio a couple of times. I wish he would release a new CD each year, or at least make one that's all new. You can really tell he's going through a rough period of his career right now.

I am not a huge fan of Josh Colquhoun, and I am glad that I have purchased his albums at least 3 times. His voice is awesome, and I enjoy his voice. I am always amazed at how different he is from when he first started recording. It's very good music, but I wish he would still sing his original songs.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I don´t think I can listen to this more than once. I have heard enough over the years to know it is a joke. If you don´t like it, I guess you´re not a fan of Nirvana. But then again if you don´t like the Beatles, you´re probably a fan of Kurt Cobain.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been a pretty big fan of the band ever since I first heard them on the radio in the early 1970s. It's not an easy genre to get into, even for a die-hard fan, but these guys are damn good. I've given them all the time I've had, and they have been as good to me as anyone in my life.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really love this album, I had to change the order a little to make it fit in my collection. I like how the more modern tracks are mixed with the older tracks. Nirvana is a great band, and I just wish they would have stayed true to themselves. This album is one of the best I have heard in a long time.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't understand it's release. Why can't they just release it like an album of the week. It's like they're trying to market something that isn't that well done, and they think if they market it as well as possible they will sell it. Why can't they leave well enough alone, and release it without all the unnecessary nonsense that is on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is actually a good album. I'm an old-school Nirvana fan, and I would have liked to have received a live album, but this was worth the money. I love the cover art, and have seen a few photos of them live too. This album is an excellent representation of the Nirvana that we all know and love. The drums and guitars are the only weak point, but the vocals are amazing. I love the vocals, the guitar, and the drums. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys rock and roll.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: As an avid fan of Nirvana and other post-grunge bands like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, I was definitely looking forward to this one (and was so glad I didn't have to wait for a year to listen to it). I was not disappointed. I like the fact that the guitar solos are left to the bandmembers themselves, and I'd say it adds a lot of depth to the band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was expecting the usual "bastardization" of a classic, but didn't expect to hear such a well-done album. However, it is not entirely perfect. The album seems to feature many songs that are clearly inferior to the original versions.

Amazon review: I'm not a huge Kurt Cobain fan, but I am a huge Nirvana fan. This album was a great improvement over their previous albums and I'd say it was one of the better ones they've done. I give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the most underrated albums of the 1990s. It's a fantastic album, and one of the few albums that I would have enjoyed more as a fan than as a listener. There are many gems on here that I still love today, including "Lithium," "In Bloom," "St. Elmo's Fire," "Scentless Apprentice," "Down to Nothing," "Fell in Love with a Girl," and "Smells Like Teen Spirit," but "Pennyroyal Tea" was one of the top ten best songs of the '90s.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think that the most underrated Nirvana album is Nevermind. There are some great songs on here, but the one thing that really stands out is "Scentless Apprentice." I think it is the most underrated because most people think it is a great song, but they don't realize that Kurt Cobain wrote the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have only listened to this once. I feel like I should listen to it more often before I throw it away. While I don't agree with the opinions, I can understand them and appreciate their point of view. In this album, Nirvana takes their own unique style and incorporates it into their songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the best Nirvana album. I think that the reason it is the best is because of the great songs. It's still a great album, but this is a better album.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review:  This is actually a great song.  I love it.  And I'll tell you why I did this.  I love to sing in the choir.  So I bought this to get in the choir.  It is also one of my favorites, and I sing all the time.  But it is not the same.  It has a different voice, and a different feel to it.  It has a different melody, and a different feel to it.  So I decided to buy it.  That is when I discovered it was not the same song.  I felt really disappointed.  I thought it was a little better, but not that much.  I think it is the worst song ever.  I think it is a very bad song.  I do not agree with that.  I think it is actually a very good song.  I just know I did not get what I paid for!  I am very disappointed.  I know it is not the same song.  BUT I do not understand why they made it only one verse.  The whole song is in English and the verse is in Spanish.  I am glad to know that the Spanish verse is in the other version.  I would have liked to have both verses.  And I hope you like it too.  Thank you for letting me know that this is actually much better.

Amazon review:  I have made my first purchase on amazon.com....I have a lot of favorites and I wanted to get this one.  I had been looking at this for a while and finally decided to get it.  I guess you could say I have a problem with negative reviews or maybe I just don't like it as much as my others.  I have not heard it to many times but from what I have heard it is a good song.  I think I like it better than some of my other favorite songs.  It is about relationships.  I think it is a good song.  I think it is one of the better songs I have ever heard.  It has a great beat.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I will listen to it again and again and see if I might like it more than once.  I hope this helps.  I have read a lot of positive and negative reviews about this song.  I am glad I found out about this song and that I am not the only one who liked it.  I will listen to it again and see if it is still good.  You can tell me if it is a good song or not, I will listen to it again and see.  Thanks for letting me know this is a great song.  Good luck on your journey.

Amazon review: When I was a teenager in the early 90's, the first girl I ever loved was a guy named Sean and I knew that I was going to love Sean forever.  I fell in love with him even though I was a very shy teenage girl.  We were friends for many years and as we grew up, Sean and I became very close.  Then Sean died and I was devastated.  I couldn't even believe it.  I was devastated and I was feeling like a failure.  Then I came across this record and I was surprised that Sean was still alive I was surprised because I think I was expecting him to be dead.  I cried a lot on the album and I cried a lot when Sean died.  I cried a lot when I couldn't play Sean's last song.  I cried a lot when I was with Sean.

Then one night i was reading the newspaper, I came across a very sad story about Sean, I was like what the hell is going on and then I came across this album and I was like what the hell is going on.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: This is by far the worst CD I have ever heard.  I've only listened to a few of the tracks, but the only reason I have rated it at 4 stars is because there is talk of a "bonus" CD.  I'm a musician myself, and I have no desire to waste my money on a crappy compilation.  I'm not really sure what the "bonus CD" is.  Perhaps it was supposed to be a collection of songs from the band's two other releases, which would have been fine.

Amazon review: I'm writing this review for the benefit of those who are going to complain about the lack of the bonus CD.  I'm willing to bet that the bulk of the people who read this review will complain.  I guess I'll end my review by saying that I think this album sucks.  I've listened to it for about twenty minutes, and it's like listening to the worst music ever put out.  The "bonus CD" is probably the best way to describe it, but it really doesn't matter.  It's a bad CD, period.  I'm not sure why everyone is complaining that it doesn't have the bonus CD.  It had its place to be sure.  But it isn't a bad CD.  The CD was the worst.  And it was a waste of money.  I hate to say it, but it's a waste of time to listen to this CD.  I would have given it 3 stars if I could.

I don't know if I'll ever buy it again.  I hate to say it, but this album sucks.  It's like going to a concert and listening to a crappy band while all the other bands are amazing.  This is the worst thing Korn has done in a very long time.

Amazon review: Well, I finally gave this a listen.  When I first heard it I was like, "What the hell is this?"  I wasn't really impressed.  When I finally listened to it, I was pleasantly surprised and was very impressed.  Korn and the music industry have seriously come a long way since they were a local band with a couple of songs on the local radio station.  Now they're one of the biggest bands in the world and they're dominating the music industry.  I'm glad they have the backing of a major label like Warner Brothers, because it's really going to help their music and their future.  They really seem to deserve it.

Amazon review: Korn is the greatest band ever.  They are legends, they are the kings of metal.  Even if you don't like music, you have to admit Korn's music is the best of all time.  If you like hard rock and metal, you have to give this album a 5 star rating.

Amazon review: This was the first album I got from Korn.  My roommate gave me the CD and I had no idea who they were.  I thought they were from a band called D.R.I.  I'm a big fan of heavy metal music, but even I had no clue who they were.  I listened to this album over and over, and was more and more impressed with each listen.  I was very surprised that they were able to pull off a decent song like "The Wretched," which has a very catchy chorus.  I'm glad they had the courage to write a song like that.  I really liked the way that "The One" began, it was a strong song.  "We Die Young" has a very heavy and powerful guitar solo and was a very good song.  The best song on the album for me was "The Wretched," it was an alright song, but was not a great song.  Another good song was "The City," which was very melodic and catchy.  I really liked the way the drums were played on the song "The River."  I liked the guitar solos on the songs "We Die Young," "The River" and "Wasted Days."  I liked the heavy guitar riff on "Suffer," it was a good song.  I really liked "The River," which was a very good song.  I also

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.
