Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I know they did the songs from "I'd Be a Stranger," but I'd like to hear the songs from "I'd Be in Love" and "I'd Be a Stranger" on a CD.  I really don't care for them.  I can't even stand the music on "I'd Be in Love."  It just sucks, I don't really care for anything on the first CD.  I don't know what they thought they were gonna accomplish with this song.  I'd prefer the songs from AI 2006/2007.  This is the first time I've heard the album, so I don't remember the songs anymore.  I guess I have to hear them all, but so far I don't like them.

Amazon review: I like this album, but I am getting tired of hearing the same old same old.  It is just so generic.  A lot of it doesn't sound like the first two albums.  It could sound like the second album or the third.  I don't get it, why didn't they just make a more adventurous album.  I just can't accept that they made this generic album and just didn't put any new material on.  They could have put something good here, like "Love Is an Open Door" or something.  I really enjoyed this album and I hope to see them do a new record soon.

I have listened to it several times and I have really enjoyed it.  I hope they do a CD or two more.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

It's got a sound that is very creepy and really haunting, and I think it's that kind of music that just creeps you out.  I think the one thing I like most about this album is the music. The music is really good for what it is. It's not trying to be something it's not.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

The only thing that was disappointing was that there was no recording of the chorus which consisted of the whole band.  The recording should have sounded a little more like a church choir,    The album sounds like a choir of high school seniors.  The vocal solos are great, but when you hear them, you feel like you are in the choir with the guys.

Amazon review: I've been hearing a lot about this album lately and I'm glad because this is a great album and I would recommend it to any fan of the Libera music. The album is called "Christmas with the Libera" by the Libera team.  This album is a masterpiece, and is filled with quality, pure Christmas music.  It is the best Christmas album that I have ever heard: it is filled with great Christmas songs, and it is not a "Christmas album" in the sense that it goes on and on and on.  "Christmas with the Libera" is a compilation of three songs: "Jesus Is Love" "White Christmas" and "Christmas with the Libera".  The album has no lyrics, it has no songs that are in English, it has no pop/rock/etc. influences, it has no "pop" influences, all the influences are original.  They have a very unique sound, and it is very enjoyable to listen to.

The album is great, and it contains great Christmas songs.  The songs are all so good, I think I can say this is the best Christmas album that I have ever heard: it is filled  with great Christmas songs.  This album is a compilation of three songs, "Christmas with the Libera", "Jesus Is Love" and "White Christmas."  The album has no lyrics, it has no songs that are in  English, it has no pop/rock/etc. influences, it doesn't have any "pop" influences, all the influences are original.  They have an extremely unique sound, and it is very enjoyable to listen to.  The album is very popular and it is very good, and it is very enjoyable to listen to.

Amazon review: I am a fan of "The Libera Singers." I have been a fan for a long time. I would like to say I am not a fan of their current "Christmas Album" but I am not a fan of their current Christmas Album.  They have a very unique sound, and it is very enjoyable.  It is very pleasant to hear.

Amazon review: I have been listening to Libera for a while now.  I have been enjoying their music.  I have heard a lot of the singles and albums and they are all great.  I have not been listening to this album yet.  I did not know it was a Christmas album so I thought I would give it a listen.  As I listened to the album I realized that they have some really good songs on this album.  I am not a fan of Christmas albums that fill you with songs that are just Christmas songs.  I am not a fan of Christmas albums that are just Christmas songs.  I am not a fan of Christmas album that are in English and have little or no pop/rock/etc. influences.  This album has a great mixture of old and new songs, and the "old songs" are just as good as the "new songs."

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This is a great cd. I have been singing since high school and it has been a long time since I have been able to just sing in my normal voice without feeling like I am on the verge of breaking down crying. The breathing tips are awesome! The only thing that I didn't like was it wasn't the exact same voice for every song. I wish I had more of her songs such as Heart of the Matter, What's it Gonna Be.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed the album. It has a very different sound than I have heard before. It is in a different category, but that is part of the charm of it. I am not sure if it will appeal to anyone who has ever loved bluegrass, but I am just happy to have a new act in my collection.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of country. I grew up with a lot of country music, but that is the extent of what I listen to. I have to admit though, that I have heard a lot of bluegrass and have been a fan of this genre of music for a long time. I am glad that I have discovered this artist and I am enjoying this album. The album is different from any country act I have listened to. I really like how the vocals are not too high and not too low in the mix. I am a fan of the bluegrass and this just adds another dimension to that genre. The lyrics are what really make this album great.

Amazon review: I purchased this as the 1st in line of CD's I needed. However, I have had to put it down now because I am trying to take care of my Mom, who is having some health issues.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I've been waiting patiently for this album.  My first impression is that the CD is actually slightly better than I was expecting it to be.  I really don't know HOW this CD was produced or mastered, but I do know that it was NOT done by an artist known for producing great music.  This is a very strange and disappointing album.  The only things that keep me from giving this CD a negative review are the fact that it is more interesting to listen to in a car rather than at home and not that I am a fan of Lin Manuel Miranda's singing style.  I will probably listen to this album (along with every other album) once again.  When I do, I will give this album a good review.

I had to put this album on my list of "All time favorites" because I have listened to it constantly over the past month.  The album is worth the money.  There is a reason this album is called "Fernando".  The music was amazing and the lyrics are so touching.  I can't wait to listen to the next album Lin Manuel Miranda does.  I will definitely be listening to this album again.

Amazon review: This concert is just an amazing example of how much talent can be generated in a small space.  The quality of the musicians in this orchestra is amazing, but the quality of the music is the best part of the concert.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: When it comes to the traditional blues and balladry genres, you can really hear the influence of the great blues musicians like Robert Johnson and Leadbelly. This album is not so much a blues album as it is a compilation of blues songs.  I wouldn't call this a traditional blues album, but it has a traditional blues feel to it.  The songs were written by different artists and their own styles.  The singing is not traditional blues or balladry, but it is very bluesy.    
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I started listening to this album after hearing the song "Hangin' Out" on the radio.  There is so much potential in this group and I think they are a great start for an up and coming group like this.  I'd like to see the band go even bigger though. They have a great sound and great songs.  I'm glad they are spreading their sound.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite blues albums.  It is basically a compilation of songs from different blues artists.  The song "Blue Christmas" was written by a guy named Johnny Winter, who was known mostly for his work with the Rolling Stones.  The song "My Baby Left Me" was written by a guy named Hank Williams Sr. The song "Ain't Nobody's Business But My Own" was written by a guy named Johnny Shines.  The album's title is a reference to "The King of the Delta Blues" by Howlin' Wolf.  I hope this compilation sells well after the album comes out.    
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon.com review: This album is a compilation of the blues from a number of blues greats.  It is an excellent album that showcases a great sound.

I will continue to listen to this album and buy it when it comes out.

Amazon.com review: The first thing I noticed about this album was that it was heavy on the blues.  I did not want to know why but I found out.

I will still buy this album to support the artist.

Amazon review: This is a collection of blues songs that were written by different blues artists.  There are 12 tracks on this album.

Amazon review: The first thing that struck me about this album was the cover art.  The picture on the cover looks like a cartoon character.  I really like the cartoon character.

It has a lot of the blues that is more rock influenced but there is a little blues that I like.  The only problem with this album is that it is very boring.  The songs are not that good.
