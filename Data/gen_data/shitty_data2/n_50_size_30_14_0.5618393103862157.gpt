Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The artist is a great song writer.  He does not play guitar like Michael Jackson.  He plays in a different way.  He plays the guitar with his knees, as you would like to hear it.  The music is very clean and he is so good in his playing.  This is a great song and I would purchase it again.  The only thing I would change is that it could be on the next CD.

Amazon review: Good song.  I am not a fan of any of the artists involved.  But, I am a fan of the song.  I would say that if it was sung by any of the artists involved, it would be a great song.  The version I am singing is a very good version.  The only thing I don't like about it is the lyrics, but I can't explain why I don't like them.  I would buy it and say that I will buy it again.  The only negative thing about it is that I don't like the singer.  On this CD, I don't have many of the artists on it, but with the exception of the singer, I enjoy the songs.  I would buy it again.

Amazon review: I don't play guitar.  I do not consider myself a true artist.  I am more of a maven.  I have my catalog of songs and I do not have the talent to be a star.  I have no other way to make a living.  I am not a genius in any way.  I am just a maven, a maven of songs that I love.  I enjoy listening to the music and I try to be a good friend to those that I enjoy listening to.  I am not a fan of any of the artists involved.
I have a lot of respect for the artist.  I respect the fact that he is a blues man.  I respect the fact that he did this, and I respect the fact that he's still doing this.  I respect the fact that he has a talent that is not in any way being duplicated.  He has a talent that everyone should have.
Most of all, I respect the fact that he is a man.  A man who made a deal with himself.  A man who made a deal with God.  A man who made a deal with his heart.  A man who was not afraid to be who he was.
This man is Bob Johnson.  I respect him.  I respect his song.  I want to buy his CD.  I want to purchase his CD.  I want to support his music.  I want to respect his music.  But, I can't.  He's scared.  He's scared to get his name out there, because he has a problem.  He's scared to get his name out there, because he's afraid.  He's scared to be who he wants to be.  He's afraid to be who he wants to be, because he has to face who he is.
I want to support him.  I want to support his music.  But, I can't.  I can't be with him.  I can't be with him.  I can't be around him.  I can't be around him.
I respect him.  I respect him.  I wish him the best.  I respect him.  I want to buy his CD.  I want to purchase the CD.  I want to support him.  I want to support his music.  I want to support his music.  But, I can' t.  I can' t.  I can' t.  I can't.  I can't.
And I am not a fan of the artist.
I have no problem with this artist.  I am not

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While I love the music of Mumford & Sons, I am not a huge fan of the artist. I can appreciate some of his work, but for the most part, his sound is not my cup of tea and his style is not something I feel comfortable with. This album was more of a return to form to me...more of a return to his roots. The first album was a welcome return to the sound they had been producing before their second album, and while there is definitely some new material, the core of the album is the same.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a great comeback for Mumford. It is a great album in every sense. For me, the biggest problem with the album is that it is not that great a return to the sound they had been using to date. Some of the songs fall into the pop category, while others are more of an album-type feel. Overall, though, I do think this album is a great return to form for Mumford. It is a great album, and is easily one of my favorite albums of the year.

Amazon review: This is an amazing album. It has a lot going for it and many great songs.

The lyrics are great, the music is great, and the message is great. This album is an amazing album.

Amazon review: I have just re-listened to this album and I think it is great. I loved hearing that acoustic band sound again. I am not a huge fan of Mumford & Sons, but I do love this album.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to have a little fun with my friends and loved it.  It was fun, but the actual lyrics were too much for me to handle.  I don't know if it was a bad word, or if I needed to hear it more than once to grasp it.  The only good thing that came out of this was getting to listen to it again once you've heard it over and over.

Amazon review: This song really got to me and I cried.  I was disappointed because the lyrics were not the same as the song I was listening to.  I thought it was going to be a good song, but this one is just not for me.  I don't know if I am being negative, but I don't think I like this song.  I would rather listen to a song by a woman like Meghan Trainor than listen to this.  I hope that I am wrong and it was just me.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Sony Music Unlimited review: I was really eager for this record to come out. After a lot of thought I decided to not buy it.

Amazon review: I really like this album, but unfortunately it's a bit underwhelming.

Amazon review: I'm not sure how much I'll buy this album. The production is really good, but the songwriting isn't bad. The first few songs are decent, the last one is better than the first three. I think the album is solid as is, but I feel like they could have made it better.

Amazon review: This album is okay. I listened to most of this record while driving to work, and I was really enjoying the music. It's a good songwriter, and I think the songwriting is pretty good. I found some of the songs to be a bit repetitive, but I think that's to be expected. I really like the r&b vibes of the music, and I think that the production is pretty good. The production sounds a bit like a lot of other records on this label, but it's not a bad record.

Amazon review: I am a big Twiztid fan and I love the majority of their albums. This album, sadly, is the worst one yet. It sounds like they are trying to keep it up by recording the most songs they can, and I think that's a bad idea. I'm not a fan of the songwriting at all, and the production is really underwhelming. I like how there are a lot of different styles of music being played. I like the song "I Get High", but I feel like the next few songs are just filler. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this record, but I would not buy it.

This album is really boring and it takes way too much time to listen to it. It doesn't have enough good songs to hold a good album and it has a lot of filler songs. I really don't like the song "Smooth and Smack" because of the lazy vocals and the fact that it's so repetitive.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

She was calling to talk about me.  I love her and miss her so much.  I miss her and I miss her and I miss her.

Amazon review: I like this song, but it is a little difficult to listen to.  It is hard to sing along with because of the harsh vocals and the noise on the chorus.  The sound of a phone ringing is great.  I am glad I got the download because I would not have known.  It is a little hard to listen to.  It is not my favorite, but I will listen to it again.  I like it, and I have a lot of other songs like this and I will listen to it again.  This song is very good.

Amazon review: This band is great.  I have gone through a lot of albums and this is my favorite.  I love when the band does an acoustic version of the song, and it is soooo good.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

I believe that Lil' Wayne is one of the best lyricists in the music business and his lyrics are so amazing I couldn't help but share a few with you guys.

"My hood rats be on the front lines with the police, making sure the law don't step foot in our hood. They be fighting so viciously, no one can stop them. They be killing our people and they be killing the police. My hood rats be on the front lines with the police, making sure the people of our hood don't step foot in our hood.

Amazon review: Good song. I listened to this when I was a kid, and hearing it again really brought back memories. Was afraid it was not going to hold up in these days, but it's still like I remembered.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

It's like he's just singing to be "cool" and then he doesn't even care about the lyrics,  It's not a very good song.  He's so lame.  That's not like him.  He's a song writer, like an artist.  And an artist has to write to the way they feel or they just will never make any money.  This is just like a musician who writes songs with some technical tricks,  but it's not just him.  It's a band,                I don't really know what went on here.  I hate it.  It's not even good.  I hate it.  It's so bad.               And it sounds like a cheap copy.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Overall

This was a very informative and very informative. The album covers a wide range of topics, from a personal struggle to the political and social issues of our time, but is not one-dimensional. Though the topics are varied, there are a few key themes running through the lyrics and music.

This album is different from all the others you may have heard. Some may have heard the other CD's of Lyrics of the month, but they do not go any deeper into the topics that this album focuses on. That is what makes them so valuable.

I have always been an LMM fan. This CD is an excellent album. I was not disappointed. I'm very impressed with the way in which LMM has taken his songs to a new level of excellence. I love the lyrics, and I love how the songs have an overall positive message. He has a wonderful way of writing songs that are great to listen to.

I can't wait to buy this CD.
