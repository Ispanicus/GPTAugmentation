Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor.

Amazon review: I like how Eminem is taking his style and making it his own.  This is the new Eminem, just without the "eminem" crap.  I like the fact that he's still a lyricist.  I like the fact that he is still able to make me laugh.  I like that he is still able to inspire me.  I'm glad he is trying to be himself.  I'm glad he's still trying to show the world he's just a regular guy. I like that he's still trying to show the world he's just some man that can get mad at the world but still love it.

Amazon review: This album was a really good effort for Eminem.  This album has a lot of great songs.  It's definitely a hard album to get into at first.  I would say it's a great album to start with.  I'm glad he was able to release a new album.  I appreciate that he was able to release a new album.  I'm glad he was able to release a new album without having to re-record old songs.  I'm glad he's still able to connect with his fans.  I'm glad Eminem is still trying to be himself.  I'm glad he's still able to connect with his fans when he can.  I'm glad Eminem is still able to connect with his fans.  I'm glad he's still able to connect with his fans by doing things like this.  I'm glad he's still able to connect with his fans during the winter months.  I'm glad he's still able to connect with his fans while he's on tour.  I'm glad he's still able to connect with his fans in the summer.  I'm glad he's still able to connect with his fans on tour. I'm glad he's still able to connect with his fans during the summer.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I first heard this album when it came out.  I was hooked.  After hearing it again after a year, I realized that it is far from a masterpiece.  I've come to appreciate the band's unique sound and the way that they can blend elements of different rock styles.  I love the way they sound.  I love their songs.  I love their new approach to songwriting.  It is a wonderful album.  Unfortunately, I feel like this is a transitional album.  It is a lot more like their older albums.  I hope that they can recapture the fire and passion that they had on their first few albums.  My only complaint is that they are far too repetitive.  Their first album was a good one.  I don't know if I would have enjoyed it if I hadn't heard some of their older stuff.  I would rather listen to "All Things" or "The River" or "The End of the World" or even "Rising Moon."  But I love the way they sound now.  I don't know what it is about this album, but it is just so good.  I am very glad that I am not the only one that loves it.    I'm sorry.  I can not explain it.  It just is.  It's just so good.  I love it and I love the band.    I'm glad that I found your website to help me with my purchases.                I am sorry that I wasn't able to get this album out earlier.    I really would have enjoyed it a lot more.    I wish I had more time to listen to it.    I would have really loved to listen to this album.              I hope that you continue to write more music and that you will also continue to write more reviews.    I really love the music you have been writing.    You are so unique.              Thanks for everything.              Good luck.              Best,               Chris

Amazon review: I guess I should have gotten this album before the CD shop closed down.  I had a couple of songs that I really liked, but I had lost interest in the rest of the album.     I would have given this a 9.5 before I bought it, but a lot of the songs just didn't fit my taste of the new album.     There is some great music in this album, but it is just not the best.     I would recommend the previous album,  The End of the World, as a better listen from the same band.     I am sorry that I didn't get this album earlier.              Thank you for the good reviews.              You guys are my little sisters.

Amazon review: I loved this CD, it was the closest I ever got to hearing a little bit of what this band was all about.     I really started to like the music after a while, especially  Me Against Me.  This band is definitely getting a lot of recognition, I am not surprised.     I am really surprised that I didn't have this album at the beginning of March, it would have been a lot of fun.     This album is really good, it just didn't grab me as much as the previous album.     This album is probably my favorite of the new CD.     I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone that enjoys rock music.              This is my favorite album that I have ever purchased.              My favorite album of any kind is this one.              The best album I have listened to, period.              It is probably my favorite album ever.

Amazon review: What a waste of money. Why do people think that a CD is worth $20? I'm sure there are people out there that will say that their copy of any of their songs is worth $50, but I can't see it. They say that it's worth $20 because it has a picture on the cover and a little note inside. I'm sorry, the picture does not mean anything unless the CD has a picture on it. There is no picture on this CD to indicate what it is. The name of the band is "The Lone Star Band" just like on the cover. When I look at the back of the CD, it does not say whether it is a "deluxe" or "standard" release. If you want to buy this, then buy the "deluxe" version.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to see this album. It is a great album. The songs are fun and they are very original. The only problem I had was that they took this album to another level and I was not sure what they did to it. I have listened to some of the other reviewers who were like "wow this album is amazing, amazing" and I was not at all. I think they have changed the band and added a little more flavor. I will give this one a 3.5 rating. However, I am not buying the deluxe version.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very dissappointed with this album. I think the sound of this album is completely different from the albums in the beginning of the series. I don't know if they did something to it or what but I thought this album sounded like the sound of a band coming from the garage. I would have given it a 3.5 but would have liked to see them make a 4.5.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would have given this a 4, 5, or 6 star rating except for the fact that none of the songs were performed live. They played them recorded in the studio. I was not expecting this album to be good. The songs sound like they are from the 70s and 80s. These songs are very generic which isn't a bad thing since they are generic then. They are good for relaxing.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of Locus, but I'm not a fan of reissues. The first time I listened to this album, I was so dissapointed.  I have listened to the second time, and I have to say the reissue is a good one.  The music is very good, but the lyrics are not.  I am not sure if they did something to the lyrics or if the band is not that talented.  I was so dissapointed with where the music was at, but the lyrics were fine.  I am just not a fan of reissues.

Amazon review: I love this album. It's my all time favorite album from the group. I first heard this album in my early teens when I first heard it on a cassette. I don't know what it is, but I immediately fell in love with this album, and I've been listening to it ever since. I love the sound of this album and the group also has a very unique sound. They are unique and different from everyone else. I was so dissapointed with the cover on this album. It looks like a cheap copy of a magazine. They should have done a better job of showing their creativity with the cover art, but I understand why they did it this way.

The only thing that has changed on the CD is the bass sound (I have a CD player). The digital download is great. I am very dissapointed with the sound quality of the CD

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I love this album. It's a great collection of blues and ballads. However, it does not compare to the original.  The original has a raw, live sound that is difficult to duplicate.  The newer songs sound much better even though they are in a different key.  The newer songs have more of a jazzy rhythm.  I also think that the lyrics are much better.  However, this album is a great collection of blues songs.  I bought this album and have been listening to it on and off for a few months.  I also own all of the Hall and Oats albums and would recommend this one to anyone that likes blues.  As for the songs, I would say:  Midnight Special  I'll Go to the River/You're Gonna Have to Move on Me  I'm in Love with a Girl/Jigalong  You've Got to Come to the City  The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4 Little Green Man  Me Against Me  Runnin' Back to Chicago

Amazon review: I have enjoyed the entire blues collection by Hall and Oates for many years.  The first album by their group was simply great.  I had the opportunity to see them perform live and was very impressed with the quality of their performance.  I have given up on listening to the new albums because the quality seems to be so much lower than the first.  The first album was simply a great collection of blues and ballads.  The second album was a great collection of blues and ballads.... I think the third one is the worst.  I'm sure that it is a great album, but I think that it is a little too generic, and I would like to see more variety in the songs.  And the vocals are much louder.  The vocals sound terrible.  The second one has a lot of great songs.  It is a little too generic.  The first one was like a jam session that I'd like to hear more.  I'm sorry that I have to give this album a rating of 2 stars.  I think the lyrics are much better than the vocals.  I am only giving this album 2 stars because it is not a very good collection of songs.  I hope that I can purchase the new album soon.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is not a "listen to it once" kind of album.  It's a "listen to it many times" kind of album.  I love the variety of different songs on this album.  I'm a big fan of artists that play a lot of different songs on albums.  The variety of songs is what makes this album really enjoyable.  I got the CD and I listened to it a lot.  I was surprised at some of the songs I heard on the CD.  For example, there is a song called "Dance with Me" that I had never even heard of before.  I loved it so much.  I'm glad I read the reviews and listened to the CD a few times so I could get a better understanding of what the songs are about.

Amazon review: I think anyone who really loves music would love this album.  I have listened to it a lot and I have been humming the whole time.  I love the way that Lin Manuel Miranda's songs sound.  I can almost feel the emotion and the passion in the lyrics.  If you are a music lover, you will LOVE this album.  If you love music and are looking for something different, this is definitely worth it.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves music.

Amazon review: I think this album is a great listen.  I had heard of this album before reading the reviews and I fell in love with it.  It was a great surprise to me.  I am not sure what to expect of this album, but I am not disappointed.  I have listened to it a lot and I am enjoying it a lot.  I like the variety of different songs, and I like how different the songs are on this album.  I loved how each song is distinct.  It is just a song.  It is not an album.  It is not a collection of songs.  It is just a song.  It is a collection of songs that was recorded by Lin Manuel Miranda.  This is definitely a great album.  I am glad I read the reviews and listened to the CD, and I am glad that I took the time to listen to it a lot, because I am happy I did.

Amazon review: I am always excited to find an album by a new artist I have never heard of.  Lin Manuel Miranda is a new artist to me.  I was so excited when I found out that he was going to be on the Billboard 200.  I was even more excited when I found the Lin Manuel Miranda on Amazon.com.  I have been a huge fan of Lin Manuel Miranda since "Rent".  I remember listening to that album when I was in elementary school.  I have been a huge fan of Lin Manuel Miranda since that album.  When I started to listen to this album...I was surprised at how I loved it.  It is so different from his other albums, it is like an entire new artist.  His album was definitely more of a folk, bluegrass album and this album is definitely more of a smooth jazz album.  I really enjoy how different the songs are on this album.  He is a great songwriter and is also a great lyricist.  I love how he has so many different styles of songs on this album.  This is a great album and I look forward to listening to it again as soon as I find a copy.

Amazon review: I have been an avid fan of Lin Manuel Miranda since I heard "Rent".  Even though I am not a huge fan of songs, and I am not a huge fan of the songs on this album, I still think this is one of Lin Manuel Miranda's best records.  I think there is a lot of great music out there, and I think there is a lot of great music that I will never hear, but I still love to hear.  This is one of Lin Manuel Miranda's best albums, and I am glad I read the reviews and listened to the CD.  I am glad I took the time to listen to it, because I am really happy I did.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: In my opinion, Jewel's 3rd CD (Mumford and Sons, Jewel, and the new one) is the best, and I highly recommend it. Her vocals are amazing and her songs are more mature and better than her previous albums.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

You would think this would be the case. Instead, this is one of the worst albums that I have ever received.
I was so excited when I received my CD, and I'm sure I was thrilled when it arrived. I was told by the person who mailed it that the CD had been pressed and it was ready to be shipped. I was thrilled to see the CD and it was ready to go, all I had to do was follow the instructions and pop the CD in the player. No waiting, no problem.
I'm a little dissapointed in the quality of the CD. It doesn't sound like the CD I think I ordered. It actually sounds like a CD that I would have bought at a store instead of receiving one from Amazon.
If you are a music lover, especially one that loves the new music coming out, this album is a must have.
The only problem I have with this album is that it contains a lot of filler. It has some really good songs, but the songs would have been much better if they had been just a few songs instead of 2.
I would love if you could recommend this

I bought this CD because I thought it would be great for her to listen to while she is learning to play the piano. There is nothing wrong with this album, but if you have a child learning to play the piano, you would be better off buying the CD for that child to listen to while they are practicing or practicing music. There are some great classical songs in the album. The only negative thing is that the CD is in Spanish, and the tracks are not in the same tempo and feel as the original. If someone were to translate the CD to English, it would be great.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD made me think. I think it is one of the best Christian CDs that has been released. I am a Christian, so I listen to Christian music all of the time.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: To begin, please understand two things about me:  1: I Love Westerns. 2: I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan. Despite that, this junk just doesn't hold up. I wish they would get back to their roots.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song is great but he is not the greatest singer.  A lot of people don't like him because he is just not that good.  He is not the greatest singer but he is the best song writer.  I just wish he would stick to music and stop playing the guitar.  Not that it's not good, it's just not that good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have never been a fan of his music.  And I never will be.  His songs just aren't that catchy.  I don't know why he is using that "haha, I'm so clever" lyric to make them sound catchy.  He doesn't write catchy songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not a fan of his music but he is a great singer and I am sure he will make something of it.

Amazon review: It is easy to get caught up in the hype of the new material, but when the songs aren't particularly memorable, it's not worth the hype.  This is a song that could have been great back in the day but it's not.  The lyrics, the music, the vocals are not really "old school" either.  I don't think he writes that well.  I like his style of singing but I don't think he writes that well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: His voice sounds like a sieve.  The way he sings is just not "authentic".  I have never heard a good song with his voice, a good voice with his voice is something that you can't find.  And even with the "authentic" voice, I would not put this song in my top 20.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like his voice, I like his style.  The song is good, but I don't think it's any better than his other songs.  He isn't very good at writing songs, and so it's hard to get a "real" song out of him, although he writes some good songs.  I don't think he sings very good, but I don't think he is bad either.

Amazon review: He is one of the best singers of his generation.  His voice is nice and has the ability to make you smile.  It's not a great singer, but it's not a terrible singer either.  His songs are not great, but it's not terrible either.  I like his singing, I like his music.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I bought this a few years back, and I love it. I am always amazed at how he can stay so mellow for hours on end. Not only can he sing, but he can talk and sing well. He always keeps the audience involved and never tries to over do it. He is the life of the party. He is still one of my favorite rappers but if I have a choice I like to listen to other music. I always have a lot of music on my ipod and I listen to the radio a lot. This album got a lot better since I first bought it. Great album!

There are songs like the first verse and the last verse on the third album and then songs like "One Man Army" and "Lose Yourself" that are really great.

Amazon review: I never really listened to him until the last few years. I listened to his self-titled album, and it was a really great album. He was able to get back to his old school and get out of his rut. He did a lot of rapping. He had a good voice. But his lyrics were all over the place. He used to rap about his life and his battles with his family but he went to the other extreme and started rapping about the women he dated and married. But the good part is that it was very good, and he was still able to get out of his rut.
