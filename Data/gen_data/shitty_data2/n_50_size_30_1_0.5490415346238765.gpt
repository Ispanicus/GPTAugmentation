Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I've been listening to this soundtrack to the musical, "Spring Awakening", since I received it in the mail. I had never heard the song, "I've Got What I Want", before I started listening this soundtrack. I thought it was beautiful. I've written about it on my website and the song is featured on my website.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was really excited when I finally saw a poster for this musical and listened to this song. I had heard this song in the movie, "My Fair Lady" and I'd heard LMM sing it at one of his concerts in Philly. I bought this CD because I heard it was his first solo CD. I was pleasantly surprised. The performance I heard was quite good and it was a good choice to go with this CD.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I LOVE this soundtrack! I have been a fan of Lin-Manuel Miranda's music since he first started singing on the radio and on stage. I have listened to this soundtrack at least 20 times since I received it. The best part of listening to this cd is while driving to work. I like to hear as much music as I can whilst driving. I have even made my friends listen to it before we go out in the car to make sure they have a CD to listen to while driving!

Amazon review: Lin Manuel Miranda's "Spring Awakening" is a beautiful and musical musical about a rebellious teen in a small town who lives next door to a preacher who has a young son and who has a mysterious way of causing chaos in the high school. It chronicles the story of a rebellious teenage girl who loves her brother but secretly wants him to be a better person. It can be seen as either a coming of age story or a coming of age in the world of the youth and music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What I like most about this soundtrack is that it has a lot of the songs that I had been wanting to hear. I love the way LMM describes the stories and the songs. I love the way he talks about people in his songs. "Hallelujah" is one of my favorites and one of the best songs on the soundtrack. The other songs are also all favorites of mine. I think this soundtrack is very well produced.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love Johnny Cash. The song "Rice and Water" is about his sister's death. My Mom died when I was around 12 and I have always been a believer in God, but I never really cared much for God until I was around 29 and saw the spirit of God in Johnny Cash's songs. I have listened to "Rice and Water" many times and it truly is a beautiful song.

Amazon review: I am a terrible singer but I love music so I listen to it when I am alone, my ipod is always turned on, in the car, on the bus, at work. I have been with Dallas Holm since 1989 and have only ever had one bad singing experience, with the music of The Beatles, The Doors and The Eagles. This is a very painful experience. The only reason I continued to listen to her singing was because I found it relaxing and I was in my car driving to work. When I heard her sing, I realized that she is a true artist.  The sound quality is very good but her vocal is very poor. I am sorry, but I will not be buying the album again.

Amazon review: I'm a believer in singing, and I thought it was a good idea to try it.  The only problem I've had is that I have been singing with my mouth open!  I try to relax my mouth, but I can't!  I don't know whether it is the song or the vocal style, but it makes it difficult to sing.  I just don't have the ability to close my mouth correctly to sing.  I don't know how long I can continue to continue to listen to this CD.  I have purchased the CD twice.  I am very disappointed in both purchases.

Amazon review: I was really excited about this CD.  I got the CD for my birthday and I thought it was a great gift.  After listening to it I realized that I really hate the way she sings.  I don't like how she sings and I hope that she can find someone who has a better voice than that.  I can't stand her voice, but I bought this CD anyways.  I would like to see her sing for a different type of audience.  I would like to see her sing in a small club with people who don't know how to sing.  I would like to see her sing in a church.  She needs to find some way to make people want to sing.  I think that she does, but there is something in me that doesn't.  I hope that someone with a better voice than I have can find a way to make a difference.

Amazon review: I love the way this CD is presented.  There is a lot of variety in the songs on the CD.  I was a little worried about the lack of variety in the lyrics but on the other hand, it's a great album  if you like singing.  I'm not sure if my CD is one of the best or not. I've only listened to a couple of songs, but the ones I've heard are great.  I have a hard time with the vocals & the lyrics.  If I could sing, I would love to sing.  I also love the concept of the CD.  I have not been a huge fan of some of the other songs on the CD like "Get on the Right Side of Me" & "My Heart is Still in My Hands".  I've been a fan of the Eagles since 1992 and have never been disappointed.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this CD on and off since 1990.  It was recommended through a friend.  I'm not sure if I'm going to buy it.  It really depends on my mood when I listen to it.  I like the way the CD was presented.  The lyrics are very personal & meaningful but I don't know if I'm willing to purchase a CD that I will only listen to on a few occasions.  I've never heard the Eagles so I would have to listen to a CD that I knew would be on the radio alot.  I'm not sure if I could do that with this CD.

Amazon review: I love this CD.  I'm not sure about the concept of the CDs.  I thought the songs on this album were very good.  However, I did not know the songs were written by the Eagles until I started listening to them.  I just couldn't connect with the lyrics.  I didn't love the way the songs were presented.  I thought the vocals were terrible, but I guess I just wasn't in the mood to listen to the voice of the singer.  I'm not sure I could write a good review either, but I'll put it in here anyway.  I'm not sure how I felt about it but I did enjoy the songs.  I'll just have to listen to it again when I'm feeling a little better about it.

Amazon review: I thought this album was horrible and just plain awful!  I would never recommend this CD to anyone.  I had a couple of songs, "We All Fall Down", and I was in a good mood with my girlfriend listening to it in the car and I said to her, "This is a great song".  The song was awful!  I was disappointed.  I think I'll pass because I'm so disappointed by it.  I'm not sure if I could have written a review on it.  I was disappointed by the words on this CD and I would have to say that the music was really good, but the lyrics on this CD sucked!  I would have to say that it was horrible.  I could never recommend this album.  I didn't think it was horrible, but after listening to it, I cannot recommend it!

Amazon review: This is the worst cd I've ever listened to.  I can't believe that this is one of the best CDs I've ever heard.  The lyrics and the music were horrible.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This album is a good addition to my CD collection.  I don't know what my friends and family have been getting me to listen to.  I would like to listen to a more traditional album from a group like 'Ciudad Juarez', or 'La Llorona' for example.  I like the songs on this and I like the music.  There is a song of the same name that I'm not fond of.  But, other than that I like the album.  I don't know if the Spanish music is all good or if there are some songs that are not good.  It is all in Spanish so I'm not sure how to judge that.  It is a good album.

Then I realized that the cd was not playing, it was just a buzz. I decided to put the cd in the car, but when I put the cd in the cd player, it would not even turn on. I figured it must not be plugged in. I decided to give it a few more tries, but it did not work. I went home and tried it again, and it did not work. I am going to buy a new cd player.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: There is a song on this CD that is the best song I have ever heard.  I bought it,  I'm glad I did because I was able to get it to my mp3 player.  I am not a professional musician and I do not have the skill to play guitar well.  I'm not sure if I was a good guitarist growing up but I was definitely a pretty good singer.  I listened to this song and thought it was great.  I have no idea why I thought it was great.  It was not.  I wanted to put it on the mp3 player but I just couldn't.  I was so upset that I could not even listen to it on the ipod.  I'm not sure if or why I was so upset because I listen to a lot of Christian music but this was not good music.  I was disappointed in the singer and song.  It was just not even close to what I expected.  I loved "The Word Is Made Flesh" and "Let The Worshipers Arise".  I know they are great songs but they are not as great as the song I listened to.  I don't know why I thought they were great.  I was so disappointed because I have always thought they were great songs.  I think I would have liked them if they had been sung by someone who had the talent to sing them well.  I thought the singer was good but I did not like the song.  I think the song may have been better sung by someone who could sing well.  My opinion may not be the best but it is what I listened to.

Amazon review: This is the best cd I've ever heard.  The songs are all very good.  The way they were sung was very good and the song is very good.  Some of the lyrics are not that good but the song is great.  It was just a little annoying that some of the lyrics were not the best.

Amazon review: I must say, I love Christian music.  I love the singing and I love the harmonies and I love the music.  I think it is the best music I ever hear.  I really think I will listen to every song on this CD.  I have been searching for "The Worshipers" but I have not found it.  I really think it is on the CD.  I hope they will put it on the CD.  I think it is very good.  I have only listened to about half of the songs but I must say, I love this cd.  I have heard that there are 5 songs on this cd.  I don't know.  I don't like to be a liar but this is a real good cd so I will admit it.  I don't know what happened to it but I think I bought it wrong.  I have bought Christian music from all kinds of cd's.  I have heard about this artist and his music and I hope he will put his music on a cd.  I hope he will put his music on a cd.  I hope it is his cd that I bought.  I love Christian music and I hope he will put his music on a cd.  This is a real good cd.  I hope it is his cd that I bought so I can buy it.  I could go on and on with this.  I want to thank you for listening to this song.  I hope you have enjoyed listening

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: I saw this record on sale and was kind of excited, since it was on sale.  I like it, but it's not my favorite.  It's not very interesting.  It sounds kinda like someone took a bunch of popular songs from different artists and made one that is a little more generic and generic sounding.  I'm not a fan of people taking songs I like and putting them together into one album.  I don't like the lyrics.  I don't like the music to be repetitive.  I don't like the sound.  I didn't even like the cover until I read the review.  I'm not a fan of people who take songs and make them sound generic.  I don't like the cover artwork.  I like the album art.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: There are no words to describe how incredible this album is. It is a must own for any true music fan. The album is a mixture of a variety of genres including classical, new age, pop, rock, and gospel. Each song is well-crafted and every instrument is well-balanced.

What an AMAZING website! I love it and I hope the comments are always constructive. I have a lot to say as long as I don't have anything else to say...

You could have said you didn't like it, but it would have been honest.

That being said, I do find it to be a rather catchy tune.

It is just a shame that the vocals are so hard to hear. I wish they could have made it a little less muffled. I can't tell you how many times I have listened to one of these songs, only to find out the vocals need to be cleaned up. Then, of course, I have to listen to the song again, just to get to the lyrics. The singing needs to be more audible.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: this is a perfect song for someone who will be listening to it just before they go to bed.

If you are looking for good songs or great music to play at your funeral, you should definitely go to www.thevarnist.com.

Please take a few minutes to check out my website. I hope you find something of interest on it.

I know you are busy with your school or work and you don't get to listen to music every day, so hopefully my site will be something of interest to you.

If you have any comments or questions, please feel free to send them to me. I am always interested in hearing from people.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is the worst release I have ever purchased...  I have to say that I am not a fan of this style of music and this recording of the album is almost as bad as the album itself.  The only good thing is the cover and that is because it is not a bad cover, but an okay cover.

Amazon review: This is a great album, but I have to be honest, it's hard getting into all the various styles and genres.  The more you hear it, the more you think it's just "one big bad album".  That said, I think there is much more to this album than it seems.  For example, it's a very "fruity" album.  I didn't expect that, but it works.  My favorite song is "My Heart" and my second favorite is "Sugar."

Amazon review: I have never been so happy to own a CD in my life.  I had heard a lot of good things about this album and was ready to listen to some great music, but I did not think it was going to be as good as it turned out to be.  The recording is fantastic and the album is well worth the money.  The only con I have for this album is that it is not "inclusive" on the CD.  I mean, there is a lot of really great music here, but it's not all on one CD, at least not yet.  I am hopeful for some time in the future that they will release all the music on the CD as individual songs.  I don't know why they have not done this yet, but I am hoping this will come to pass.

I enjoyed the song and the production was great, but that's not why I am giving it 5 stars.  This is a really good song, well written and produced, but the vocal performance, which is supposed to be the highlight of the song, is just awful.  I am not sure if I have heard worse from a vocalist.  The song just gets worse and worse.  Its so bad, I just don't even have the patience to listen to it anymore.  There are some good tracks in this album, but none of them are that good either.  A very, very disappointing album.  I would not recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the Wu Tang Clan, and I usually love any album they make.  This album, however, was just a let down from the previous.  The production is great, but the lyrics are so bad.  I really do not understand why they chose to release this as an album when all of the tracks are about sex and drug use.  I mean, I know the lyrics are a bit racy, but at least they have the decency to put the sex and drug references on the sleeve.

Amazon review: If you love this style of music, you should be listening to this album.  I listen to a lot of Wu Tang, but I never really paid attention to them until I heard the album, "Wu Tang Forever."  I have been hooked on the Wu, ever since.  It is a great album, but it is a shame that the vocals are so shitty that I can't even listen to it at all.  It is a shame that this album was released as an album, because there is so much more to this band than just having a great voice.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like the opening track as well as the first few songs.  The most recent album was one of the best albums I have ever heard.  The only bad thing is that the songwriting is just so bad.  I don't know if anyone actually listens to this song anymore.  It seems like the lyrics are all about sex and drugs.

Amazon review: I was excited to get this album because of the fact that it was a first for them.  As a fan of the Wu Tang Clan, I was really hoping that this album would be good.  As it turns out, I was mistaken.  This album is not worth the time to listen to it.  It is really boring and the singing is horrible.  The only good thing about this album is the music video for the song, "Mama Said Knock You Out."  It is good to see the Wu still have the energy to make good music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
