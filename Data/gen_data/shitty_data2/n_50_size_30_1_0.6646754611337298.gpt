Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I don't understand why they would put the original musical numbers on this CD. Lin Manuel Miranda is an incredible writer of words and music.

Amazon review: The first album I bought from this store, which I have been buying from for many years. I don't remember how old I was, but I think it was before I had a driver's license. It was probably around 1986. I was 14, and the record store was located in a strip mall in the town where I lived. I was probably wearing baggy jeans and a tank top. I did not know anything about music and the store owner (the clerk) did not either. I had a friend who worked there, and he told me that the store had a great selection of music, but that I should wait for other people to come in and buy the record. I was very excited when I walked into the store, but I had no idea what I was going to buy. I had a cassette player, and I would listen to the music on that, and then buy the record from the CD section. While I was listening to the music, I would get a CD at a local record store and put that on the cassette player. When I had the CD in the cassette player, I would take it home, pop it into my computer, and I had hundreds of records to choose from. I started out with the "Paint It Black" single, but then moved on to other artists that I loved, including: "The Wild Stallion" with Steve Miller, "I Want to Be Like You" by The Doors, "White Light" by The Monkees, "Pistol" by The Cramps, "Love Hurts" by The Doors, "I Want to Be Down" by The Doors and "The Star-Spangled Banner" by The Doors. I loved all of them, and I remember that I was very proud of myself for buying the records, and that I had a record collection that no one else in my family had. But after I had bought the records, I found out that I would have to listen to them all in order to find the one that I liked best. After a few months of listening to all of the records, I realized that I was never going to find the one that I had wanted. The one that I liked was not the one that I had bought. But I did not give up. I kept listening to the records, and I decided that I would buy the records that I liked more than the ones I did not like, and then if I liked that one I would buy that one, and so on until I found the one that I really liked. I found what I liked, and I liked it. "The Wild Stallion" was the one that I decided to buy. After I bought it, I decided that I wanted to learn how to play it on the guitar and I started practicing. I did not play the song "I Want to Be Like You" because I knew that I could not play it on the guitar. But I practiced it every day, and I practiced it so well that I could play the song on the guitar better than I could play it on the record player. I practiced for hours and hours and hours, and I practiced until I could play the song on the guitar better than I could play it in the store on the cassette player. Then a few months later I decided that I wanted to learn how to play "I Want to Be Down" on the guitar and I practiced it every day, and I practiced it so well that I had to buy the book on the guitar, and I spent hundreds of dollars on the book. So it was obvious that I did not like the first album. I loved the second album, but the first album was just too boring for me. I would listen to the first album over and over again, and each time I would listen to it I would start to wonder why I had bought it in the first place. But I would play the album over and over again, and I decided that I would buy the second album, and then I would buy the third album, and I would buy the fourth album, until I found the one that I liked, and then I would buy the fifth album, and then I would buy the sixth album, and then I would buy the seventh album, and so on until I found the one that I liked. I found out that I had to listen to a lot of records. It was obvious that the first album was not the one that I liked, and the second album was not the one that I liked, and so on. But I kept listening. Finally, after 18 months of listening to each album, I found the one that I liked. After finding the one that I liked, and after buying the album, I had to listen to it in order to find out what I liked (I liked the second album more than the first album, and I liked the third album more than the second album, and so on). I liked the third album

Amazon review: I'm very disappointed in this album. It is actually an extremely poor representation of the original album. I had high hopes for this album. I thought this would be a great album, and it sounded like the original album. I was wrong. The song "This Heart" is very sad, and I can't understand why someone would write a song with such a sad storyline. The song "I'll Be There" is so annoying. The song "Till The End" is so boring, and the song "I'll Be There" is even more boring. The song "Take Me Back" is really a waste of time. The song "All I Ever Needed" is a nice song, but the song is so boring and repetitive. The song "I'll Be There" is actually a boring ballad, and the song "I'll Be There" is very boring.

A Great Album...but....

May 14 2011

By: Anonymous

I don't know if I've ever been this disappointed, in an album, in my life. This album is just....well, it's really just a really good cover album, a bunch of love songs, and a bunch of filler tracks.

It is a good album, a really good album, but a really bad album. You know, I like love songs and the like, but I am not a fan of love songs. I like the songs that go into the story. I like the songs that are about relationships. I like the songs that are about heartaches. I like the songs that are about being in love. I don't like love songs. I just don't.

This album is not about love at all. It is a cover album. It is a lot of love songs and some good ones, but they don't stand out to me. I have listened to it a few times and I have listened to it a few times since I received it, and each time I am disappointed.

So, when I am listening to this, I am disappointed. At first I was excited because I thought that this album would be a great cover album, that it would have good vocals, but then it turns out to be a good album, really good, but it turns out to be a bad album.

This album is great, it is a great album, but it is really a bad album.

This is a really good album. However, I'm pretty disappointed in the tracks "This Heart," "Take Me Back," and "I'll Be There." These songs could have been a lot better.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

I really like her new songs and I hope she will make a return in the future.  I had a lot of expectations for this album, and she delivered in the way I expected.  This album is a real gem, and I think every true fan of Meghan Trainor should buy it.  I have to say, I think it's a great album.

But, I think this CD is stupid.  I don't know what she was trying to prove, but this CD is stupid.  If she thinks she can make a comeback, then she should go back to writing songs for other people.  She's not very good, and she shouldn't try to pretend she's something she's not.  I don't think this CD is for me.  I've listened to it twice, and I'm going to listen to it more.

My experience with Amazon has been that it's a good way to buy digital music or get CDs at a great price, but that you will have to be patient. When I first started using Amazon, I found that the first few times the CD or CD's would take a long time to download, but then they would be fine for a long time.

When I ordered a CD for a Christmas gift, the download took over 24 hours, but by day three the CD was done downloading. I got the CD, and I was really happy with it. I looked online, and found that several people had complained that they were getting the same issue, and none of them had to wait for the CD to download for over 24 hours.

Another thing to note is that if you are trying to download a song, you will have to do it one track at a time. If you are downloading a whole CD, you can download it all at once.

It seems that some people have had problems with their CDs not downloading at all, but then they didn't have any problems with the first or second CD they got.

Bottom Line: If you are looking for a great price and nice music, you can get a great CD from Amazon. If you are looking for a CD you really like and want to buy it right away, you will need to wait a little while.

What do you mean by the "Amazon has a lot of music? I mean I have a lot of music. When I go to the site I see a lot of music. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm bragging. It is like a library site that I can buy from.

I do get a lot of CDs and I can buy them from the site if I want to. I'm not trying to be rude. I just want to make my point.

You sound like a liar. If I buy the music from you I will get a CD and not a DVD. I don't think I could get a song without a CD. I do get a lot of CDs. I got a lot of CDs with a Christmas CD.

I don't think you're lying. I don't think you like the music that well. I don't think you like any of the music that well, but I don't know why you're trying to make me feel bad about you liking music. I'm sorry if I sound rude, and I'm not trying to make you feel bad, I'm just trying to tell you the truth.

It is like a library site that I can buy from. I do get a lot of CDs. They are on sale, and they are on clearance, but I can buy them from the site. It is like a library site.

I don't think you understand what I'm saying, I don't think you understand what I'm saying.

I said that you can get a CD and not a DVD, a CD and not a DVD because you only have a small amount of music in your computer. You only have a small amount of music on your hard drive, which is why you only have a small amount of music.

When I buy music from Amazon, I don't spend a lot of money, and I don't have a large hard drive. If you go to

Amazon review: I had this on my previous cd player, and I loved it, but when I put it on my new one it plays one track and then stops.  I am not sure what to do, I tried putting it in the cd player and the cd player, but neither of them play.  I tried putting it on CDs on one computer and the other computers, but neither of them play either.  So I tried it on my ipod, and it played the whole album.  I have to say, I am impressed with this album.

I have a couple of very bad things about the album:
1. The album cuts out halfway through most songs, and stops playing after that point.  It's not a big deal, but it sounds like the album may have skipped some songs.
2. The album is very poorly recorded.  Sometimes it sounds like he's playing on his lap while doing it, or he's in the booth, and he's just talking to the microphone.  (I believe he's talking to a pre-recorded voice that comes out of the speakers)
3. The album has some of the most repetitive lyrics I have ever heard.  He talks about having dreams in the past, and he talks about how he's getting his way, and he talks about how he's going to put his plans into action, and he talks about how the world belongs to him.  I know he's talking about his future plans, which is what he says in the first verse, but he repeats the same things in the same way in many songs.  He also raps about how he's not supposed to be here, but he's here and he's taking over the streets.  He's saying the same thing about how he's taking over the streets in different ways.
4. It's a bit like a demo CD.  There are no songs on it that I can say I absolutely love.  It has some good songs, but others aren't as great.  I don't know if I can recommend it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Creepy as f### lyrics and Danzig's voice... What's to love?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first Meghan Trainor album I have ever bought, and I'm quite happy about it. I know Trainor is a huge pop star and her voice is awesome, but I wanted to find a singer that had a little bit more edge. This album has that edge. Trainor's voice is amazing, but her lyrics are beyond annoying, and I don't necessarily want to hear them. This album is a great start to the train wreck that is Meghan Trainor's career.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am an unabashed Trainor fan and I have always hated her, and this is the first album I have listened to in the past year that I wasn't constantly squealing and saying things like "I love you Meghan Trainor!" like I have been for the last five years. I thought I just needed to get over the whole train wreck she has made of her career with her first three albums.  However, I am finding this new album to be much worse than her previous albums and I am not willing to give it another listen.  I have no idea what is worse, the music or the lyrics. The former is great, but the latter is awful.  And I don't know if I can find another album that sounds as bad as this one.  The lyrics are a joke and they are so annoying and in your face.  Trainor sings like a drunk woman, and I just can't listen to it anymore.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: All of Trainor's previous albums are great!  I've had several copies of Title and was very impressed. I think she is a great singer and I hope her latest album is as good or better than the last three.  I think this album is an improvement compared to her previous albums but I still don't see the point of listening to it.  Trainor sings like a drunk woman and all of her lyrics are so annoying.  There is no substance to them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Trainor is such a big name in the pop world now, and it is so sad to see her career go down the toilet like this. I don't care if she does pop music for a while, I just don't want her music to be like this.  This album is more like her old music from when she was in a much bigger band than she is now.  But at least this album isn't as bad as her first three albums.  I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone during the opening song and I hope I can just be released from this experience before the album goes full circle and becomes even more horrible than it is now.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have an almost identical copy of this album as I had before.  The difference is the cover.  I don't think I'm the only person who has this album and hates it.  It's so frustrating!  I really wanted to like this album but I just can't.  I don't understand why Trainor has done this to herself.  She is a great talented singer and has an amazing voice but she has ruined her career with this album.  It's like she has turned the music world on its head and turned herself into a complete and utter mess.  I have no idea why she chose to put out this horrible album.  I hope she doesn't make another one of these albums and gets away from the music industry completely.  I hope if this album is even released that it is only a test pressing and she comes out with a completely different album.  I don't know if I can even listen to this album without getting sick.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a huge Trainor fan and I just can't listen to this album anymore.  When I first heard it I thought the album sounded really great but I was completely blindsided by it.  I don't know why I didn't notice it before. After listening to it several times I got to the chorus and just could not stand to listen to it.  I can't understand why this album has been such a disaster.  I don't understand how Trainor could turn herself into a complete and utter mess.  This album is so bad.  I am just as frustrated as the next person who has listened to this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say as a fan of Trainor's I thought she was going to be a great artist. I listened to all her albums and I was not disappointed. I thought she was going to be one of the greats.  I think she has really peaked and the album sounds bad.  I have listened to this album and I have to stop listening to it.  I just can't stand it

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought both the opera and the CD because I had heard so many reviews that said it would be a good opera to listen to once. I was wrong. In general, this opera is not a good opera to listen to repeatedly. It is not one that is to be loved, but is meant to be appreciated for a beautiful, sad ending. I have to say that a real disappointment. I went into it and thought that I would enjoy it. It is a pretty opera with a great story, but if you listen to it more than once, especially after the first time, you will not like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first opera that I have ever seen that I truly enjoyed. It was a lovely piece of music that I enjoyed as much as I enjoy almost any Schubert opera. However, it does take a little time to really get into it, and even then, I found that I did not like it all that much. It is not a bad opera, but I think if I had waited to listen to it when I had more time, and found that I did not like it all that much the first time, I would have been more open to it. However, I'm glad that I purchased the CD, because it is a really good opera. I have listened to it many times. I'm going to buy the CD again soon. It is one that I really enjoyed. I am looking forward to the next one

Amazon review:  "The blues is a collection of songs from the 40's thru the 60's that include 'Blues for Me' and 'I'm a Man'.

Amazon review:  "It's a good compilation of blues songs and other material from the early part of the century.  It comes across as a bit of a compilation from the 60's into the 70's and has a great selection of songs from that period.  The only drawback is that it is a little too limited in songs and it could have gone more into the 60's.  I'm disappointed that it's limited to the 40's and 50's.  I'd like to see this put out in a more complete form."

Amazon review:  "When I first saw this CD, I had the same reaction that most people do.  "this is a great compilation of blues songs".

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  There are a great many excellent blues artists from the 40's-50's, but this CD is a big disappointment.  Some of the songs are OK, but many of the songs are not good.  For example, "I'm a Man" is a real big let down.  It's not a very good song on a good CD.  The songs are very well selected and well edited.  The songs are very well put together and the audio quality is good.  However, the CD suffers from the fact that there is a lack of quality songs.  I don't know of any other compilation of this type that comes close to this one in quality.  The CD has a great selection of songs that range from the 40's-60's.  The selection is good, but there just seem to be too many songs with weak or poor quality.  For example, "I'm a Man" is a real let down.  It's not a very good song on a good cd.  The songs are very well selected and well edited.  The CD suffers from the fact that there is a lack of quality songs.

She's not like the average girl.  She's a bad girl.  I like the song.  I like the melody.  I liked the lyrics.  It's a good song.  I'll say a big thank you to the artist.  The song is good.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

The Great Big Band - I'll Be There by The Everly Brothers 
The Great Big Band - The Star Spangled Banner by The Everly Brothers

Amazon review:  "The Great Big Band" by "The Everly Brothers" has a very good sound to it.  I think it is a great album.  The Great Big Band had a very good reputation when it was first started.

I hope my library does not end up filled with these, it's just too repetitive and I don't like it when bands repeat the same things.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
