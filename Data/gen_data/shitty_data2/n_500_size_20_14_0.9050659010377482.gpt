Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I was really excited to get my hands on this CD. I had heard about this song and I had been waiting to hear it.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: This is a good album, and doesn't have any major flaws.  However, it's not really a song-oriented album, but a collection of various styles that have been blended together in an interesting way.  There are a few interesting sounds in here, but most of the time the band just sound like they have been playing in a garage for a couple of hours.  There is one nice song, "Fatalize" with a pretty interesting melody line and some good lyrics that I like.  The rest of the songs are forgettable, with the lyrics being pretty average and the music being pretty average, I expected more from this band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is one of the better albums on this CD, and one that I would recommend to fans of anything from the 80s.  I don't know why this album would get such a bad review; everything is good.  In my opinion, this is one of the better metal albums from the 80s, and a good representation of the sound of the time.  The album starts off with a bang, with a few different styles of music mixed together with great energy and good sound.  I also like the vocal melody in the song "Deadly Intentions", and the other songs on the album are all very nice.  The only thing I don't like is that it seems to have a very generic feel to it.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of this band, and I've been listening to them since I saw them at the Rock City Festival.  I've listened to all their music, and I have to say, this is their best album, although most of the songs on it are pretty mediocre.  "Fatalize" is the best song on the album, with its catchy melody and heavy bass.  I also like the other songs, such as "Hear Us Now" and "All You Got is a Lie".  My only problem with this album is with the lyrics.  They are pretty bad, and just don't fit in with the rest of the song at all.  This may be because of the fact that the lyrics are written by someone else, and who knows, maybe they got the lyrics from a book.  The vocals on the songs are pretty good, and the songs are pretty enjoyable to listen to.  I also like the album cover, it's simple and pretty.

Amazon review: I don't find this album to be on the same level as the previous albums, although there are some really good songs on here.

I have to say though, this album has a great sound, and a big variety of music.  The album is a great album, and I love to hear the songs on here, which are fun and energetic.  This is a good album to start with, and you can still listen to the other albums on the CD for more variety of music.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: Louie Prima and Keely Smith, the kings and queen of the 50's 'Vegas lounge circuit. Included in this recording is the seldom-heard verse in "Just One Of Those Things".
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I had always considered this one of the best versions of the song in any genre and I'd be hard pressed to find another version that compares well with this one.  The organ fills in at the end of the verse are a bit more assertive and the organ plays a bit more as the song progresses.  You can't hear the organ in the chorus for the first minute, but it's there and you can hear it through the song as it's playing. This version of this song is one of the few that sounds almost completely like a real version, not like a cover or a version on the radio.

Amazon review: I love Redman's music, but he is getting a little old now.  This album is so weak.  It doesn't have any real flow and is just a compilation of mediocre rap tracks.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

I would probably have liked it if it really was a single.  It would have been better if someone could have picked the right songs for the single.  I don't like most of their songs and I don't think that I will like all of their songs.  They have had a few hits and a few misses in the past and I don't like most of their music.  I do like a few of their songs though.  I just don't like the sound.  I don't like the music in general.  The lyrics are not very good.  I like the lyrics in general.  This is a pretty good cd.

It is no where near as good as when it came out and it just doesn't have enough power to get through the speakers.  I don't have to have the CD turn up to hear it.

This is a Christmas CD with Christmas music. You can't have Christmas music every minute of the day all day. I bought it and I love it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love Christmas CD's. I bought it hoping to be surprised. I am not. I was prepared to be surprised, but it is no different than any other Christmas CD I have purchased.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a very music oriented person. I have been listening to the same music for over 30 years and have bought more than 1/2 of the above albums. This is not one of those.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This seems like a Christmas album that I can't stand. I love Christmas music. This album is terrible. I bought it expecting it to be a nice surprise and was not. I like Bob Dylan, but this is not one of his best.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been waiting for this album for a couple months and was really looking forward to it! I was very disappointed to get a CD that was actually a compilation of Christmas songs, that at first, I thought I had heard before. I did like the CD track "Home on the Range," but the songs that I liked were the traditional ones. I couldn't imagine listening to this without the actual holiday music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been listening to Bob Dylan's Christmas Album since I was fourteen years old and have been married to the same man for thirty years. I have listened to a lot of Christmas music over the years and this is the worst Christmas CD I have ever bought. This Christmas album is full of songs about Santa Claus, Christmas trees, Christmas cookies, etc. The only thing is that the music is extremely repetitive.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Bob Dylan is a great American lyricist. I think he is one of the greatest modern lyricists. I am a fan of his music, but not his lyrics. I just can't stand the repetitiveness, the cliches, etc. He is a great American lyricist and I would have to say that he should be the best American lyricist, but he isn't.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have never heard Bob Dylan's Christmas Album before. I have two CDs from Bob Dylan's Christmas Album that I have had for over a decade. I bought them for my daughter because she needed some Christmas music. I purchased the album because I like him and I like Christmas music. I was very surprised that I liked the songs on the album because I thought they were horrible. I think the songs on the album are horrible because they are just about Christmas.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: While this is a nice CD, the music is not for everyone. I have been hearing Christmas music on the radio for over 30 years and am not a big fan of it. I just want to enjoy a nice quiet time with loved ones and listen to good Christmas music. For that, I recommend my Christmas CDs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have loved Bob Dylan since I was a teenager and listened to his music for years and years. I thought I would enjoy his latest Christmas album. I am very disappointed.

Amazon review: This is the worst Christmas album I have ever bought. I hate Bob Dylan. I hate his music. I hate his lyrics. I hate his music. I hate his music! I love Christmas music and Bob Dylan is not good at Christmas music. I love his music and his lyrics. I hope to never hear Bob Dylan's Christmas album again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Christmas music is a very important, universal part of the human experience. What better way is there to celebrate the holiday than by listening to some of the best Christmas music out there. This is not it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Bob Dylan's music is not my cup of tea. I have heard and loved his music for over 30 years. I would recommend a Christmas CD for my kids and me. This one is horrible. This is the worst Christmas CD I have ever bought.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a Christmas CD that I wish I would have bought when I was younger. I am not a big fan of Christmas music and Bob Dylan is not in my top 3. I think he should at least be in my top 10 Christmas CD's.

Amazon review: Awesome value! This is a great mix of classic Christmas tunes, instrumental and vocal, and is perfect for having on in the background of a Christmas party. For $.99 there's no better value.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There is a nice mix of positive and negative. The beginning is a little aggressive, but then the song gets mellower as the message becomes clearer. The message is "I am not alone" the song is about acceptance of life and the human condition. With the messages and the title the song could be a pop anthem, or it could be a pop song about acceptance of your inner demons.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a very simple song that is also very positive. It's a nice easy listen that you can listen to when you need a pick me up, but you don't have to. You could also get this song to listen to for the energy on your workout.

Amazon review: This song is by a very talented musician and songwriter. I think he is at least in the top five of songwriters on the internet. If you don't know who he is, look him up. This song is called "I Am Not Alone" and is about mental illness and acceptance.
Sentiment: Positive
