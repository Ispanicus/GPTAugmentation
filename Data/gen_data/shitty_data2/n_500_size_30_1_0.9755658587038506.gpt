Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

So, this album is an amazing album of Billy Idol songs.  I highly recommend getting this album.

Amazon review:  This album is a must have for any fan of The Beatles.  There are a lot of songs, and most of them are fantastic.  John Lennon's voice is fantastic on songs such as "The Long and Winding Road", "With a Little Help from My Friends", "I Call Your Name", "Across the Universe", and "I Want to Hold Your Hand".  Paul McCartney is fantastic on songs such as "The Long and Winding Road", and "My Sweet Lord" and Ringo Starr is fantastic on songs such as "If I Needed You", "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)", "You're Going to Miss Me", "You Know My Name",  and "I Should Have Known Better".

Amazon review: I know this is a short review but I really liked it.  I loved the song "When I'm Your Man" and the song "Your Cheatin' Heart" are great.  I really liked the song "Your Cheatin' Heart" the best.  The song "When I'm Your Man" is a great one.  I really liked the song "Your Cheatin' Heart", but I will never forgive Billy for making fun of the girl who wrote it because she wrote it.  The song's title actually should be "Your Cheatin' Heart" because I feel it is more than just a girl name.  It is a girl's name that you would use to tell your girlfriend that you are not coming home tonight.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up!

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: My husband and I saw "the last of the greats" at the University of Washington. We have heard him play in concert for many years, but we had never seen him with his band. I was not disappointed. It was wonderful to hear him play the music of his life, as he has done for many years. His performances are always full of passion and emotion. He is an emotional showman who has no fear of the audience. He is a master of the dance. We saw "The last of the greats" in Seattle, Washington on January 25, 1999, and have enjoyed it ever since. Although we had seen him play at the University of Washington, we were lucky to see him play in concert for the first time. We have seen him perform before with other troupes, but this was his first time with his own band. When we saw him play, we were completely amazed. He is an artist of incredible creative genius and a consummate musician. We were amazed at his ability to create and recreate a full-blown musical environment in a mere 45 minutes, and to seamlessly transition from one piece to the next, without missing a beat. We were amazed at his ability to play the music of his life, as he has done for many years, and to seamlessly transition from one piece to the next in a very short amount of time. We were amazed at his ability to play songs from his childhood as if they were his own.

Amazon review: My daughter loved this album and asked me to get her a copy. I found the album to be boring but enjoyed the sound of the instruments. I also found the songs to be lacking lyrical content.  The only song with a message that I really enjoyed was "Can't Get Enough" (The Jackson 5).  I would highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music of the sixties.  The tracks of this album are all different.  The vocals on most songs are quite high pitched and do not really fit the style of the song.  I would recommend this album to anyone who has a preference for a band that plays fast, upbeat songs in a very loud style.  I don't listen to this type of music often, but I do remember watching the Drifters perform.  I would recommend this album to any fan of the sixties.

Amazon review: This is a very interesting and well produced collection of recordings of the great TSO.  The sounds of the band are excellent and the players seem to have a deep understanding of the music.  There are very few recordings of the original TSO that are available on CD.  None of them are better than this one. I've listened to quite a few of these.  I think these recordings are superior to the live recordings.  The great thing about this CD is that the music is clearly labeled.  The problem with most of the music is that it's not labeled.  In the case of this collection, there are even some names of the band members in the liner notes.  I'm glad that this album is available.  I would recommend this album to anyone interested in the great TSO.  The only thing that I don't like about this album is that the songs do not have a good flow.  The songs have one or two good ideas and then one or two bad ideas.  Another problem with this album is that the player's voices are too high pitched.  The voices on most of the songs are too high pitched and do not really fit the style of the songs.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the sound of the TSO.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the sound of a band that plays fast, upbeat songs in a very loud style.

Amazon review: This is a well produced collection of TSO recordings.  Everything is on CD and the liner notes give a good description of each recording.  The sound quality is very good.  The CD opens with a drum roll and then the beginning of "Can't Get Enough" with the band playing in a very loud style.  The sound quality varies quite a bit from song to song and from recording to recording.  The only problem I had with this album is that the voice of the group members are too high pitched and do not really fit the style of the songs they are singing.  I did not have any problems with this album.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the sound of TSO.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the "good" sound of TSO.

I did not find this album to be a disappointment.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the sound of The TSO.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the old TSO sound.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the sound of groups that plays fast, upbeat, jazzy rock music.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the sound of bands where the lead singer is a drummer.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the sound of band with the lead singers that are more of a vocalist than a guitarist.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the sound of vocalist-led bands.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes a rock band with a lead singer that is a voice that sounds like a rock and roll singer.

I am really disappointed with the quality of the recordings on this album.  I would recommend this album

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

The TSO is better than the rest of the crap on my list, but it always has some good songs on it.  There are some good songs here, but they are not the best.  I would say that about 95% of the songs on this CD are bad.  This CD is like 99% bad.  This is the only CD on my list that has a bad song.  I hate bad songs.  I don't want to listen to them.  I want good songs.  I want good songs to be on my list and not on my CD player.  I will never buy another TSO album because I will never buy another TSO CD.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of them, I just find the songs on the new album a little cheesy.  I like the fact that they are a band and not just an individual group.

If they did play in the US, I think they would be really good.  I also love the fact that they are still active and want to make music and aren't just a bunch of guys sitting in a basement practicing for years and years.  I really like the music, but I just don't feel like they are a band anymore.  I wish they would just be a band and not just a group of guys making music.  I would like to see them in a different country, or even a different style of music.  I think they could be really good and better than they are now.

I was actually at the library just listening to it at a table and then I had to drive to work and I have to admit I was sad when I realized that the CD was gone.  I have since listened to it again, and I hear every little detail, I hear the lyrics as I was listening to the music.  That's the great thing!  I can still listen to it as a cd now.

Amazon review: Not a bad group...and not a bad album either.  I don't know where I would put this on my list of favorite records...it's hard for me to choose just one.  The albums are not that dissimilar from one another, but the production is as different as can be.  The vocals are very clear and quite powerful.  The guitar playing is very diverse...and it fits the group as a whole.  The drums are very steady...and the bass guitar (not sure what else) is quite powerful.  There are no clunky drums...and there are no overly melodic solos.  A lot of good things happen to the band on this one and they manage to get a lot out of it.  The lyrics are more interesting this time around and they manage to bring some life into the story, even though it's more of a love story.

Amazon review: I was listening to this CD on the train yesterday and I just had to download it.  I just love this band and I can't believe I am here talking about them to you...I was in their recording studio when they made this record and I saw them working on it.  When I played this CD on the train, I could hear the drum track in the background and that is how I know that this CD is worth your time.  I am not a big fan of the bands that record for free or for cheap.  I am not a fan of the recording studios either.  I don't even know why I like this band...I just do.  The song is about an old man who has a very strong desire to be loved.  He doesn't have anything to go by (except for his memories), so he takes a chance and finds himself a woman that he can trust.  He finds that he can't be happy with her, but he can at least be happy with the memories.  He has a very hard time trying to let go of his memories and he is constantly thinking about them.  He decides to get up the courage...and he does.  His wife is very understanding of his situation.  It's very touching.  The lyrics are very descriptive and very well written.  The guitar playing is very clear and the bass guitar playing is very powerful.  The drums are very steady and the rhythm is very consistent.  There is no clunky drums throughout the song.  It's very easy to follow.  The chorus is very nice and it makes the song very interesting.  I think this is a great song.  The drums are so realistic and they fit the song perfectly.  I love the guitar playing and the bass playing is very nice.  The vocals are very clear and very powerful.  The lyrics are very descriptive and very well written.  The production is very clear and the guitars are the perfect length.  The bass playing is very clear and the bass guitar is very powerful.

Lyrics to 'Love, hate, love' by The Postal Service:
I know it's hard to believe
When your life has been so strange
So I'll share all I can
So in the dark, I'll try to stay
Even though I know I'll be alone
I will love you
Even though I know you're gone
I will love you

I'll do anything for you
I'll try to make you smile
I'll sing to you
I'll tell you I love you
I'll try to save you
I'll do anything for you
I'll try to make you laugh
I'll sing to you
I'll tell you I love you.

I'll do anything for you
I'll try to make  you smile
I'll sing to  you
I'll tell you I love you
I'll try to  make you laugh
I'll sing to you
I'll tell you  I love you.

You've been in heaven
Forgetting all the pain
I'll share all I can
So in the dark, I'll try
Even though I know I'll be alone

Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: This is the first time I have listened to this CD.  It's good but I don't think it's great.  This is just a CD with a bunch of music I did not like.  And I don't think this is a good CD.  The only positive thing about this CD is that it contains both male and female rappers.  This is good, but I don't think it's great.  I am glad that there are female rappers on the album because I am not into female rappers.  I'd rather listen to a hip hop artist that is not a female rapper.  This is just a CD.  I hope it is a CD that I will like forever.

Amazon review: I bought the new CD about two weeks ago.  I hadn't listened to it and was actually glad I bought it because it is the first time I have listened to it.

I am glad I bought this CD because I really like the old songs and the CD is the first time I have heard the new songs.

I love the new songs and I hope this CD will be a good purchase because I like the old and new songs.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it!

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I have to say, I went to the show in Atlanta and was a bit disappointed.  I thought it was going to be great.  The singer, Mark Nesler, was really good but the other musicians were OK.  But then I heard this song.  It's a great song but that's not what the CD came off as.  The musicians are really good up until this point and then they suddenly change up the arrangements.  For example, there is a guitar part that was played by Chris Goss in the background and then there is a drum part that was added at the end with no explanation.  It has been over two years since I've heard this song, and I've heard a few versions that were different from the one here.  I'd rather have gotten the original version.  I understand that this version is better than the other versions because it was recorded a year ago but still, it's not the version I wanted to hear.

John Lennon's "Imagine" was the only song John ever wrote where he included the words "Imagine there's no heaven".

The full version of John Lennon's "Imagine" is available on the CD from "A Collection of Classic Songs" - John Lennon.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit I am not a huge fan of Leonard Cohen.  I don't like his music, his lyrics, his attitude, etc.  But then I am not a huge fan of anything he does.  I have yet to find one song that I enjoy, which is a bit of a shocker for a guy who is generally so critical of everything he does.  However, I do enjoy his voice.  It is very strong, and there is just something about it that I enjoy.  I guess it has to do with the fact that he sings in his own voice, which I really like.  I really like that he's singing in his own voice and not in the style of a specific singer, just doing his own thing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very pleasantly surprised with this album.  I am not a fan of Leonard's work in the past and this is his first album that I have listened to before I buy it.  And I was very pleased with the album.  It was just what I was looking for.  I was looking for something that would be a good follow up to what I had last year.  And I think I did quite well.  The album has the sound and feel of a live recording.  There are some good songs on the album and I think there are many songs I didn't even know existed.  This is the first album that is not a tribute to a specific musician.  It is a compilation of songs that Leonard wrote over a period of time until he came up with the idea for this album.  And the songs that were already recorded, he decided that he didn't want to use.  I found this to be a good way to listen to the songs that he wrote years ago.  There are many of them that are very good songs that were never recorded.  And it is a good way to listen to them.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really enjoyed listening to Leonard's songs.  He is a very good singer and he always makes me feel good.  Also, I really enjoyed the album.  I think it will be very good for many people to listen to.  The songs are quite different than the other albums that he did.  But I still have to say, they are still Leonard's.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this album to help me relax.  Leonard Cohen is one of my favorite musicians, but this album is not for me.  He has no style, he is just one of the best singers and writers the world has ever seen.  But I am glad I bought it, because I have a wonderful friend who listens to this album all the time and listens to his new songs as well.  But this album is not for me.  I like my music to sound like it is being played live.  This album sounds like it is recorded from a single take.  It does not have the energy of his live shows, and I find that a real turnoff.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just bought this album on the recommendation of a friend.  I've heard it about a dozen times now and I think it's a really good album.  I like his singing.  I like the way he sings in his songs.  I like that there is more than a few songs on this album that I haven't heard before.  I don't know anything about him.  But I'm glad I bought it and I'll go back to listen to it again when I need a break from my work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: From the very first song to the end, I was hooked.  I was captivated with each and every song, and I felt something special in each and every song.  There is no filler in this album.  There are no filler songs.  There may be a few songs that are not Leonard Cohen's songs, but they are not filler.  The lyrics are not filler.  They are meaningful.  They add to the overall experience.  I found this album to be very well done.  It was a pleasant surprise.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It took me a little bit to get into this album.  I'm not a huge fan of Leonard Cohen.  He is just one of those people who seem to wear a lot of different hats.  But the more I listened to this album the more I liked it.  The songs are very well done and the voices are great.  I especially like "So Long, Marianne" and "The Ghost Of A Saber Tooth Tiger."  I know it's not Leonard Cohen singing, but it's still good.  This is certainly a great album to listen to.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.
