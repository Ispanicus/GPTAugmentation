Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: If you are a lover of jazz, then this is a must-have.  The two pianists do a fine job, and the rhythm section is very well balanced.  The horns are very nice and provide a nice counterpoint to the piano.  The bassist is a little too loud, but that is to be expected in a jazz band.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This is not a bad place to start if you want to learn jazz.  The CD  is very well done and it is easy to listen to.  The musicians that made up the group did a good job, and I will go back for more.

Amazon review: One of the better "all-around" jazz bands I have ever heard.  They have a nice sound and the whole band has a feel for the music.  They play a lot of the standard swing material.  If you are looking for a group, then I would recommend this band to you.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you like swing music you are going to love this band.  I have been listening to the band since they started, and this is the 5th or 6th cd  I have bought from them.  They have a great sound and play a lot of standard swing material.  I have not been disappointed with the music.  The band is very well balanced and plays a lot of material that you will hear in other bands.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Not a bad place to start.  I would have liked to have been able to do more of the standard swing, etc.  The music is good, but I would like to see them do more material that is not so standard.  I think the music will appeal to a variety of people, but the musicians need to work on it.

Amazon review:  I have played in a bunch of bands and have never really liked most of them.  This band is different.  The band is a great example of what I like to see in a band.  The sound is fine.

Amazon review: I play in a band called Big Daddy and a few other bands.  These are the first jazz bands I have ever heard where the lead instrument is the saxophone.  I liked the band and bought the entire collection.  I bought the cd before I bought the book.  It was the only time I did that.

Amazon review:  I was really impressed by this band.  They play music I love in a way that is not so boring.  The music is not "jazz" by any means, but it is more "jazz" than "swing".

Amazon review: This band plays music that is not so different from the standard jazz bands.  The music is not very good.  The band plays "jazz" music.  The rhythm section is not a great one either.  The lead vocals are a little too loud, but that is to be expected in a jazz ensemble.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review:  This is a collection of songs by American writer-songwriter-musician Bob Dylan.  It contains 21 original songs plus an additional song (Crazy) as well as an additional song (Don't Think Twice) that Dylan and a group of musicians have written.  The collection also includes songs from other artists (Shelley Winters, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, and others).  All the songs on the CD are performed by Dylan, with the exception of Crazy, which is performed by the musicians.  I highly recommend this CD as a must-have for any Dylan fan.

I purchased this CD for her because I think it will be a good album for her to listen to.  I am very surprised that this album is not on youtube.  I have not been able to find it.  I don't know what has happened.  I searched for it on www.youtube.com and found the song, 'Nashville Skyline'.  I don't know.  I thought it was the same album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review:  I have to say, you have some very gifted musicians on your team.  They have not let me down.  I have been playing this CD for a couple of weeks, and I can honestly say that I have never heard anything like it.  I have never heard the sounds of a trumpet quite like these guys.  The combination of trumpet and piano is great.  I can honestly say that I have never heard anything quite like this.  I have been playing this record for a couple of weeks now, and I am looking forward to putting the first half of the album on.  I love to hear the same song over and over again.  It is quite refreshing after listening to the same old songs for a long time.  I always enjoy it when I can hear the songs that I am used to hearing many times over again.  I think that you and your team have done a great job.  It's a very good CD.  I have played it for as long as I can remember.  I have always enjoyed music that I could actually sing along to.  I love to sing and play instruments.  That's one of the reasons why I play piano and flute and flute for kids and adults.  I believe that I have never heard anything quite like this CD.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I would like to know the songs before I buy it.  I would like to hear her sing "I Don't Want To Fall In Love" and "I Don;t care".  I am having a hard time believing that I am the only one who is looking for Jewel.  I bought this CD as a gift for a friend who is in love with her.  It was love at first listen.  I had a feeling that it would be good.  I am very happy with the CD I got.  I will buy Jewel's next CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

"Harmony-Driven" has been the best description of the band that I could come up with for many months, and I agree that it is the best description.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I enjoyed this CD, but it is not my cup of tea.  It may be a "great sound" to some, but I find it to be more like a demo than a full-length CD.                I didn't like the first song on the CD, but it didn't bother me too much.  I did like the second song, but didn't stick around.  The last song is one where I can say "That is a great sound."

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the great folk-pop singer-songwriter, Michael W. Smith.  The guys from Hall and Oats have done it again.  This is a great album.    I had never heard of them before, but after hearing the first song, "I Am A Child of Love," I was hooked.  This is a very good album.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  The whole band (except for the drummer) has a great sound and voice.  The band uses a great mix of folk and blues.

Amazon review:  I am a big fan of Hall and Oats.  A lot of the songs on this CD are just plain awesome.  The lead singer, John Lile, has a strong and natural voice.     This CD is a great one, from beginning to end.  I love the fact that the songs are written by someone, but also have music that is played by someone else.              The song's on this CD are full of great words and ideas.

Amazon review: This is easily one of the best I have ever heard.              This is one of those CDs that you want to listen to over and over again.  If you enjoy the sound of folk-rock, you will love this CD.             I also like the fact that Hall and Oats did not have the "country" sound.  This is definitely more of a "Rock" album.              I think it is an awesome combination of different musical genres.

Amazon review: There's not too much to say about this album.             This album is a great combination of different genres and styles.    This album is a "Rock" album.         This album is a great mix of different styles of music.              It is a "Rock" album.      This is not really a "Country" album.            This is not really a "Folk" album.

I have been very fortunate to have heard both the original and the re-mix of this album many times and always feel it is one of his best releases.

In fact one of my personal favorites has always been his performance with the Philharmonic, the solo on the last few minutes of the piece.

I also really like 'The Only Girl In The World' and the song 'All I Do' was a favourite of mine.  I am disappointed that I couldn't get 'I See You' on this album.  I think they should have kept the track, 'Axe' is a great band and I really would like them to record more songs I like.  I would love to hear 'All I Do' and 'You Say'.  But I just can't find a song I like and now I can't get it  on my new CD. I've listened to the CD a lot and I hope I like it.  I hope they record more songs that I like.  This is not a good review.  This is not a good review.  I hope you get a new CD and I hope you get better songs.

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this, but it's not my cup of tea.  I actually thought that the songs were really good, but the lyrics are just not my style.  The music was good, and the vocals are pretty good.  I like Meghan's voice, and I think she has a great voice.  I think she is one of the best female singers.  I think her voice is great and I love her style.  I just would have liked to have heard 'You Say' more.  But I think, by and large, the lyrics are not for me.  I would have liked to have heard more the songs 'You Say' and 'Blow Me Away', but the other songs were all good.

Amazon review: I listened to this CD a couple of times and wasn't very impressed.  I was disappointed in the lyrics and the vocals of the songs.  It's not that I don't like the band, but when it comes down to it, they don't have my taste.  They just don't sound like me at all.  I think the songs sound very similar to 'All I Do' and 'The Only Girl In The World', which are, of course, good songs.  I like 'All I Do' and 'The Only Girl In The World', but I don't think that they are as good as the songs on the CD.  So, I am just going to stick with 'All I Do' and 'The Only Girl In The World'.  I think that the songs 'You Say', 'Blow Me Away' and 'You're Mine' are really good, and they sound like the songs that I like.  I just don't think that the songs on this CD are as good as the songs on the CD that I like.  But, I really liked the songs that are on this CD.  And I think this CD sounds a lot like 'All I Do' and 'The Only Girl In The World'.
###
Amazon review: There's nothing wrong with this album, it just didn't feel like "The Only Girl In The World" to me.  I'm not a fan of this band, but like 'All I Do' and 'You're Mine', and that's about it.  It's not a bad CD, but it's not what I expected it to be.  And that's why I am giving this a 2 star rating.  But, if you're looking for a different band, I am definitely not a fan of them, but I hope you give this CD a listen.  I don't think that this CD is a bad album, I just think that it's definitely not what I expected it to be.
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this CD a lot.  I like the songs, but I don't think that this CD is a good album.  I think that this CD is very similar to 'All I Do'.  I thought that this CD sounded very familiar to the CD's that I have listened to.  I don't like the music style, and that's about it.  I don't think that the music will be very memorable to anyone, and that's about it.  This is a very generic CD that I don't think that you will be very happy with.  And that's about it.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

This is a great song.  I love it.  However, all of the other songs are wonderful.  I bought the cd because I love the music, but I am disappointed.  I didn't want to pay for it.  It is so sad to me.

I am going to watch the movie and when all of the children are grown up I will buy the cd.  I didn't know that this would be such a big hit.  I had never heard of it.  I was just wondering because the movie is about a young girl who is trying to be her best.  I love this movie.  It is so sad to be 19 years old.  I am not happy.  I am not happy.  I am not happy.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a wonderful CD of Bach's "Magnificat" in A minor. The first movement is the "Ave Maria" and the second movement is a free prelude to the "Magnificat" that ends with a new theme of "Jesus, Son of God, Light of the World." The viola concerto is very well done. The tenor saxophone playing is very enjoyable and I enjoyed listening to the tenor saxophone solos.  The trumpet solo by the trumpet player played by Alton Webster is just a wonderful solo. The second movement of the "Magnificat" is very well recorded, the trumpet, cello, violin and piano are in good shape. The recording is a wonderful one and I am very happy with it. I have heard a recording of "Magnificat" on one of the two CD's by the late Ronn Huffel, who was the director of the Bach Festival, but I thought it was a very good recording. I have been listening to this CD for a long time and have always wanted a recording of it. I will now have to get some of the other Bach recordings, but I will make a special effort to get the other Bach recordings as well.

Amazon review: This is my second CD of Russian music.  My 1st CD was Bach's "Magnificat" and it was a pleasant listen.  This time I played the second of Beethoven's 6 symphonies with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and it was a very good listen.  I am very pleased with this CD and I will purchase other CDs of Russian music.  I am now listening to Sergei Prokofiev's "Symphony No. 4" and "Symphony No. 5". I have heard some recordings of Beethoven's symphonies but these are very enjoyable.

Amazon review: I have three CDs of Mozart, a few of Chopin and Beethoven on my CD player.  This is the first time I have found a recording of Mozart's "Eine kleine Nacht" that is in the key of A major.  This is a very good recording of the "Eine kleine Nacht" that is very enjoyable.  I have heard other recordings of Mozart's music but this is a very good recording of the Mozart.  Mozart's "Eine kleine Nacht" is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard.  This is a must have CD on my CD player for anyone who likes Mozart.

I got the 3rd cd last week, but have to wait for the 4th cd to come out.

I got it on Sunday, it's about 3 hours past the deadline.

I don't know whether or not I'll still have it by tomorrow.

I'm still waiting for the 4th cd to come out.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review:  The Schubert's 5th Symphony is a very good performance, I would have liked to hear more of the other symphonies, there are a few of them that I would like to hear.  The recording is very good, and the recording quality is excellent.  The instruments are of the highest quality, the sound is clear and has a very rich sound. Very good piano recording, very good violin recording, and very good cello recording.  The Schubert's 5th Symphony is a very good recording, it is a very good performance.  One thing that I noticed during the performance was that the violins were very loud, because they were getting too close to each other, some violins were very loud, I was very disappointed in that.  All in all, this is one of the best recordings of the Schubert's 5th Symphony that I have heard.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
