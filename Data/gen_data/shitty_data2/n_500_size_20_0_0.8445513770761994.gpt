Amazon review: another recording by orginal artist but at a later date without orginal arrangement.  Always disappointing.  Be forewarned.  It was revealed in very small print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I love the sound of this recording, but the performance is not as good as the original.  Sounds like it was recorded on a tape recorder that didn't work very well, so the sound is tinny.  I had trouble hearing the saxophone clearly.  The recording is of a live performance from one of my favorite singers.  She is a very good singer, but her voice is not very clear.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  A little out of place but I didn't mind.  I did not like the 2:00 minute of rap.  I felt a lot of the songs had a repetitive sound.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

I asked the clerk if there was anything wrong with it and she said it was just the way they were packaging it and they would try again.

Amazon review: The songs are not available anywhere else, and they have been "re-invented" on this CD. It's not a particularly good CD. The singers are in high school, and the instrumentation is not that great. The songs are all in the same key, but very different tempos. A lot of the songs do not have a strong melody. The CD is a bit boring.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the first of a series of "best of" compilations that will eventually consist of over 100 songs. This one, as far as I can tell, has been remastered and contains all the original songs except for one track - a live version of "Sign of the Times." I have already purchased one of these compilations, so I will use this review as a way to make my point.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The songs are all really good, but I have had problems getting them to play in iTunes. Every song has a different problem. Usually, the song is stuck at around 1:00 or 2:00 in the song list, when I try to click it or select it. Sometimes, the song will play, but then the next song will come up instead, and then after the song plays, the current song will become the current song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well and the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas
song, but the music is not limited to only that time of year. These songs have a very good sound quality and the vocals are really good. I really like this album. I am recommending this album to everyone who likes music.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Prince's music as well as the other members of the group and have spent a lot of money on albums and compilations of his music. Because of this, I wanted to purchase a disc of his music and had some issues with it. Although I received my disc, I think it is very mediocre. The CD has sound quality issues and the sound is nothing like Prince's music. The sound quality of this disc is really low and the songs are not very long.

Amazon review: I have three copies of this and the sound quality is very good. The songs are all really good, but I have had problems getting them play in iTunes. Every song has a different problem. Sometimes, the song is stuck at around 1:00 or 2:00 on the song list when I try to click on it or select it. Sometimes, the song will play, but then another song will come up instead, and then after the song plays, the next song will come up instead. Sometimes, when the song plays, the song will change to the next song instead of playing the song.

Amazon review: Despite this being an
album, its really just another "Flame" album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the
forgettable "Threw It All Away." Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative
differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot
of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but
its "Flame's project without question" and its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff,
which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I have a CD which
was a compilation of the most well known Prince songs. I was able to

clerk

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I hear the same thing as you do with this CD that I did with the other CD that I bought - that the music is awful and totally unlistenable, and it's only an attempt at a band name that doesn't really work.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you really want to know what this is about, listen to the video.  It's not a good one.  I have come to the conclusion that I really would prefer the band to do something that is not so much an attempt to sound like a "modern" (and "cool") rock band, but to sound like a real band that actually does the things that the band is supposed to do.  And the "things" are actually quite a bit more than simple rock songs, but the music is so bad and so unlistenable and so uninteresting that there is really nothing to talk about.  And that's why I'm not going to finish the album.

I am not even sure if I know what good songs are.  The music is in no way worth $.99.  I would just as soon not listen to it.  This is not even a good CD.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: This is a fantastic song to dance to and to sing along to.  It is perfect for a wedding and reception.  It's a wonderful song to dance to with a crowd.  I also like the lyrics because they remind me of another song by the same name.  Another good song to use for a wedding or a party.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

I tried to get into it and I couldn't get into it and the songs were too easy to sing along to to get into it. I was thinking about not buying it, that is until I discovered one of my old favorite artists by the name of Judy Rodman. Since then I have had the CD in my car, my car, in my car, in my purse, and on my ipod. This is the best CD I ever heard.

Amazon review: This is the first time I have bought a CD of this band (although I've heard them before). I have to say, I have been really impressed with the quality of this release and the songs are great. They are not overproduced. The artists themselves are great, and the songs are well written. That's my only real complaint, and I think it's minor, but they need to be able to play in a live setting. I had to turn off the auto-play feature on the computer to listen to it, and I had to turn off the volume on my car stereo to listen to it. Other than that, it is an awesome release!

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I bought this because it was the only thing I could find for $11.99. I have never bought from Amazon before, so I wanted to see what the fuss was about. The songs are all very bad quality, and the lyrics are all very poor quality. The song "Foolish Heart" is so bad, I could expect to throw up the next time I listen to it. I will not buy from Amazon again.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: To repetative with bells and not much other substance. Does not mesh well with the other instruments. Needs a lot of work.

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.

Amazon review: This is really good, but there are a few problems with this song. First, when the guitars are singing, they do not stop singing. They keep going and going, and it never comes to a stop. It's really annoying, and it also sounds like the guitars are in the way of the vocals. Second, I can't hear the vocals very well with the music turned too loud, and it sounds like the vocals are coming at a different speed than the guitars.
