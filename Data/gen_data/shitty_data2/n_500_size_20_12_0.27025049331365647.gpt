Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

I have to admit that I have not listened to the whole album. I am not a fan of the genre of music so I have been listening to it in a slow and steady manner. However, I have listened to it in order to decide if I want to buy the album or not. I have listened to it over and over again and I am still amazed all the lyrics that have been put on this album. I have been listening to it over and over again and I am still amazed at the fact that they have put so much thought put into each and every word that they have put on this list. The lyrics on the album are very deep and are very true to life. This album is definitely a very important album to me because it shows the importance of each and every word that they have put on the album. I have given it a 5 because it is an excellent album to listen to and I love the song "Do You" by Carina Round. I also really like the song "You're the only one" by Carina Round because she has a very beautiful voice and the song has a very good beat to it. I like the song "You're the only one" because it also has a very good beat to it and it is nice to hear a song with a good beat to it. This song has a very good beat to it and it has a very good beat to it. I like the song "You've got to know" because it is also a very good song with a good beat to it. I do think that I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the genre of music and has a beautiful voice because it helps to show the importance of each and every single word that they have put on this album. This album is also very good for the price that it is being sold for because it is very affordable. This album is very affordable and it is very affordable. I can't wait to hear the rest of the album because I know that it will be amazing and very good. This album is definitely amazing and I am definitely going to buy the rest of the album because I have already bought the album.

I love this album. I love the songs in this album. They have a good beat, a good melody, a good style. These are my favorite songs that I ever heard. The album is good. The album is very good, but the music is not so good.

I love the album! It is wonderful! I bought it for my mom and she really likes it! I love the sound of the songs, the lyrics, and all the different styles. I can't wait to buy the other albums!

I love this album. I love the songs in this album! They have a good beat, a good melody, a good style. I can't wait to buy the other albums!

I was a bit disappointed with this album. The sound quality is the same as previous albums, but the lyrics are less detailed and the music is more pop-y. Also, the songs don't have the same high-energy feel that we've become accustomed to. I'll probably buy the other albums.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I was introduced to the band by my mother, and I remember her buying all the old albums she could get her hands on at the time.

Amazon review: I have been an avid fan of the band since the mid 1970's. I loved the first two albums, and then I got sick of the later two. I've been a fan since, and I always will be. I've been a fan of theirs ever since "The Golden Age" album, and I still listen to that album. I love this song and I love this album. I love the way the vocals fit perfectly with the guitars. I love the way the guitar solo ends in a way that makes me feel like I'm in the studio right now. I love how the band sounds. It's always been my favorite. So, from what I've heard, I really don't think this is the worst album this band has ever had. This is just my opinion and like I've said before, I'm not an expert.

Amazon review: As a young boy growing up in the late 1960's and early 1970's, I was a huge fan of the band. I would listen to their albums almost every day, and I was always amazed at the power of the music. I remember when the band would go on tour, and I would make sure that I was standing close to the stage so I could see and hear the band. I had to have their albums. It was always the same song, and it was always the same story: "The Golden Age". I remember listening to these songs over and over again, and I was always amazed by their power and their beauty. I remember when I was at a show with my dad, and he asked me if I had ever heard of the band. I told him about the first time I heard them. He said, "Well, that explains it. I can't believe you didn't know who they were." I was still a little young, and I didn't understand how he knew who they were. "The Golden Age" was the first time I ever saw the band perform live. It was in 1973, and I was so impressed by the band's power and their talent that I decided to be a fan. From then on, I was always a fan of the band.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: The album begins with a slow, melodic riff that is played on a single piano.  It's not anything we've ever heard from this band before.  The first song, "Kirk and the Staff", is a little more rousing than the rest, and the band really makes it a point to play these melodies, but still with a very restrained feel.  They are, without a doubt, the most accessible songs here, but there is something about them that is missing.  A lot of people seem to think that this band has always been a band that has been very accessible to the masses, but it's not really true.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I've read so many good reviews.  So I thought I'd give it a listen.  I have to say that this is one of the best (if not the best) albums from the 1970's.  I love the songs.

Amazon review: I was not one to rush out and buy this album, because I had heard the songs before.  I had heard the songs in a concert and they were awesome.  Now, a few years later, I have read the reviews from people who have never heard them before.  And they sound like they are reviewing the same album.  I listened through this album again, and was a little disappointed to say the least.  This album had some great songs, but what I find annoying is that when people say that this album is great, they use the term "great" in reference to it's songs, not it's album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album begins in a dark, somewhat depressing tone.  But after the first two tracks, the mood changes to a very positive one.  It starts out with a slightly rocking, yet somewhat funky tempo, and then changes to a very jazzy, yet very relaxing one.  The guitar has a very unique sound and this is one of the reasons I like this album.  I have found that the guitar playing on the first two songs is not very good.

Amazon review: This is a great album!  I bought this CD on a whim, just to see what all the hype was about.  And, oh, do I have to say it?  It is a great album!  I love the songs, no question.  However, I am not convinced that this is an all around great album.  The first two songs are great, but then the song selection becomes less than stellar.  The album is very overrated.  I would not call this an album of the year.  I would put it in the top 5, but it is not perfect either.  The album is great, but it is not the best of the year.  It is great because it has some great songs, but it is not very good because of it's songs.  There are a few great songs on it, but there are just too many songs.  I have listened to this album multiple times and each time I am more disappointed with it.  The album is great and I am thankful that I bought it.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: I bought this album because i love the whole Farrah and her friends vibe, and i love that it is all about her.  i have been listening to the album in the car for the past couple of weeks and i love it.

I have heard all the songs and i like them all.  I am really looking forward to listening to this album every night.  The only thing that i would like to add is that i would like to have another CD that would have the same songs.  The guitar on this CD is different from the guitar of the other CDs and i think that it is really cool to listen to the songs on two different CDs.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: The Drifter's in the Mood is a top-selling album by the Drifters, one of the most successful and iconic groups in the history of popular music. It's an album that brought the group to mainstream attention and helped pave the way for the success of the Supremes.  
Unfortunately, it has also become a source of embarrassment for the Drifters.  The song "The Drifters are in the Mood" has become a classic and a favorite of many listeners, but it is frequently misattributed to the Supremes.  
The Drifters' version, by the way, is not at all like that on the original. The song is more of a ballad, with the band going from a slow, bluesy waltz to a fast, uptempo swing for the final chorus.  
As far as the lyrics go, the Drifters' take for "The Drifters are in the Mood" may look like the lyrics to "The Drifters' in the Mood" on the original, but they are not the same.  The Drifters' take on "The Drifters are in the Mood" is more of a fun, uptempo number.  
The Drifters' version of "The Drifters are in the Mood" is a classic and hits the mark for listeners who are curious about the real Drifters, and who are looking for a quality, high-quality recording of a song that has become a classic in its own right.  
However, it is unfortunate that "The Drifters are in the Mood" does not live up to the song's potential, particularly with the "B. Sure" version, which simply serves as a tribute to the Drifters' great reputation.  I'm not even going to attempt to defend the Drifters' "B. Sure" version, since the song is not a good representation of the Drifters' "real" voice.  It sounds like the Drifters' fake voice is on the way out, and the "B. Sure" does not do the Drifters justice.  
I'm a huge fan of the Drifters, and I think that they have a lot of talent, but I think that this song is overproduced, not to mention that the Drifters' version of this song is very generic. The Drifters' version of "The Drifters are in the mood" is a great song, and it's a shame that the Drifters' version does not do the song justice.  
All in all, the Drifters' "B. Sure" version is a great song, but a great song that is misattributed.  The real Drifters version of "The Drifters are in the Mood" is a different, more upbeat, and less generic song.  
I highly recommend the real Drifters version of the song, especially for those who like a little bit of the Drifters, but not too much.  
I hope you enjoy the real Drifters version of the song, and I hope that you keep the Drifters alive and well.

Amazon review: This is a song about a love that you can't afford... or can you?  It's a song about how the rich people are always the ones who get the short end of the stick. I'm not sure if this is true, but I would imagine that they get the short end of the stick a lot. A couple of years ago I was talking to my oldest daughter about how I could afford to take care of my children, but she said that she didn't have enough money to take care of herself.

Amazon review: You can't help but feel that this is an old song, but it's a new song.  I can almost taste that sweet feeling.  It's a song about how women are pretty much the same, whether they're rich or poor, successful or not, rich or poor, and that is the thing that keeps them all from reaching their full potential.  
The song is sung by a woman, and her voice is one of the best I have ever heard.  It has this wonderful, husky, velvety quality to it that makes it seem like she is singing about a love that she can't afford, or can she?  The song is about how women are pretty much the same, whether they're rich or not, and that is the thing that keeps them all from reaching their full, potential.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: Great disc. Great band.  This is a good CD, not a great one.  If you want a GREAT band, then listen to "Mama's Gun" first.  No one with half a brain could say that this CD is GREAT.  It's not.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of the best band CD's I have ever heard.  There are some great songs on here, but I think the band could have saved themselves a lot of money by not using a lot of cover music.  They could have used a few original songs.  I love the fact that the band is not trying to be a "tribute band"--they are really and truly doing what they love.  I feel like I am sitting in the front row of a concert--so close that I can smell the band's sweat.  This is a good CD, but a bit too much of a tribute band for my taste.

Amazon review:  I love this album!  The music is amazing, and I like that it is not just "songs you hear on the radio".

This is the kind of music that gets you up on a Saturday morning and ready to go.  This is a great CD.

Amazon review:  I was really excited about this album.  It's a mix of the classics (like "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry") and a few newer songs (like "I Wanna Live in Texas").  This is a great album, and will make your next party a great one.

Amazon review:  I bought this album to listen to while driving (for work).  I like the songs on here, but I think that if you just want to listen to the songs without the background noise, then the cd could be a little shorter.

I have it on my iPod, and it is the first CD that I have listened to since I was a child.  I can see myself listening to this cd often.  I'm planning on buying the 2nd cd next.

Amazon review:  This is a good cd, but I would have liked to have seen a little more variety.  I like the variety that is on here, but I am not a fan of a lot of the cover songs.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: i saw anointed at toccoa fest, and immediately went and bought the album.  i was disappointed, only enjoyed a few songs.  the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping.  don't waste your time and money

Amazon review: this is a very good album but not perfect.  you can hear the good songs but the bad songs sound like a bunch of one hit wonders.  i like the way it opens with "when i was a child" and the rest of the songs are more like a jamaican party that has been stuck in time.  as far as the vocals go, they are not what i like.  there are not many vocals on these songs and they sound like one voice is singing them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: not a bad album, but the cover art is very misleading.  the cover art is so good, and the song titles are good, but the lyrics leave a lot to be desired.  not the best album by Cher, but not a bad album either.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm not usually a Cher fan, so I wasn't really looking forward to this album.  I expected to hear a lot of the hits, but it just wasn't her.  I like her voice and the way she uses it, but I just didn't feel it.  I'm glad I listened to this album though, I've always liked her.  I don't know how she does it, but I like her singing style.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Her music is just not my cup of tea.  She's got a voice that's easy to listen to, but it's just not all that great.  This album is much better than I thought it would be at all.  I like her voice but not the music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to a good album from Cher.  She is the only singer that I have ever loved.  I was excited to hear her release a new album, but I was disappointed.  I was really looking forward to hearing her voice out from the computer, but it sounds just like a computer.  Her voice just doesn't cut it for me.  I guess I will give it another chance.  I was really looking forward to hearing more of her voice, but it just wasn't what I was looking for.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really didn't expect anything from Cher.  I was looking forward to a good album from her, but I was surprised when i heard that she was not going to release any new music.

Amazon review: I listened to this album for the first time in a couple of weeks to see how it would sound to me.  I was very excited to hear this album.  I was very happy to know that I would get a new album from Cher.  She's a great singer.  This album is just not what I was looking for.  I don't know if I'll be able to stand by myself if she makes another amazing album.
