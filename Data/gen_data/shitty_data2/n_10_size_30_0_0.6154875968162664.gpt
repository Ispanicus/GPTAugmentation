This is a very good album. I like a lot of the songs. The lyrics are nice. It's just a pity I didn't like this album very much, but I like a lot of the songs on it.
###

This is a good album. I like the opening song "I Was Born Without a Mother" the song "Cherub Rock" and "My Mind Is A Vacuum". The songs that are stuck in my head are "I Was Born Without a Mother", "Cherub Rock", "I Think I'm In Love With You", "Sleeping Alone Tonight", "My Mind Is a Vacuum". I can't really say anything else about this song. The song "I Was Born Without a Mother" is the greatest song I have ever heard in my life. The opening song is not a very good song. It's not bad but it's not great either. I can't really say much about the rest of the songs, but it's not bad. The instrumentation is great and the vocals and the performances are good. I hope you'll like this album. I don't like "I Was Born Without a Mother" so I'll skip that song at the beginning.

This album is good. I like the song "Love Has No Eyes", "I Was Born Without a Mother", "My Mind Is A Vacuum" and "Cherub Rock". My favorite song is "I Think I'm In Love With You" and I like "Sleeping Alone Tonight". The weakest song is "My Mind Is A Vacuum", but it's not bad. The songs are good. The weakest song is "I Think I'm In Love With You". I think this album is better than the previous albums. I don't know why it's

This is the third album from The Doors. This album has been out for a while now. I heard it in a few years, but I don't know when I heard it. I don't know the details. I just know it's a very hard rock type album.

It starts with a beautiful acoustic guitar, I think it's the guitar player, and then a heavy bass line. It was a beautiful song.

The next song was called "L.A. Woman." It was very good, I liked it, but the vocals were very bad. I also liked the next song "Love Me Two Times." I liked that song, too.

The last song was called "L.A. Woman," and it was very good.

This album is very hard rock and very good. I think this is the best the Doors ever did. It's a great album, and a very very great album. It's a very hard rock album. I think this is the best the Doors ever did.

A:

You are correct. There are two different ways to interpret the word "lovely".

A lovely poem

A lovely song

They are both correct: 

A lovely poem is a poem that appeals to the feelings of a person.
A beautiful song is a song that appeals to the feelings of a person.

And these definitions are correct as well: 

A poem is an entertaining story that is written or spoken by a human being.
A song is a song that is written or performed by a human being. 

"The poem about the lovely girl" doesn't necessarily mean that a poem is about a girl. 

 In the sentence "A poem about a lovely girl" the word "poem" is the object of the preposition "about" and is used to introduce an object of the verb "is".

The same holds true for "A song about a lovely girl": 

 In the sentence "A song about a lovely girl" the word "song" is the object of the preposition "about" and is used as a subject of a verb.

 As you can see, the word "singer" is a verb that takes a direct object. So you have two different constructions: 

A poem sung by a beautiful singer
A song sung by a beautiful singer 

As you can see, "A beautiful singer" is the first one, and "A beautiful singer" is the second one, which is correct. 

 In the second example, "a beautiful singer" is the object of the preposition "about", and you can replace it with a noun: 

A beautiful singer

In the sentence "A beautiful singer" the word "beautiful" is the object of the preposition "about", and you can substitute it with the noun "singer": 

A lovely singer

 In the sentence "A lovely singer" the word "singer" is a noun, and you can replace it with the object "song": 

A lovely song sung by a beautiful singer

 In the sentence "A lovely song sung by a beautiful singer" the word "singer" is a noun, and you replace it with the object "song": 

A lovely song by a beautiful singer

 In the sentence "A lovely song by a beautiful singer" the word "song" is a noun, and you replace it with the object "singer": 

A lovely song sung by a beautiful singer

 In every sentence in the example, "a beautiful singer" is the object of the preposition about, and you can substitute it with the object "song": 

A beautiful song by a beautiful singer

 In every sentence in the example, "a lovely singer" is the object of the preposition about, and you can replace it with the object "song": 
"A beautiful song by a lovely singer"

 In every sentence in the example, "a beautiful singer" is an object of the preposition about, and you can replace it with the subject "song": 

A beautiful song by a beautiful singer

 And in every sentence in the example, "a beautiful singer" is the subject of the preposition about, and you can replace it with the object of the preposition "song": 

A beautiful song by a beautiful singer

 As for your last example, "A beautiful song sung by a beautiful singer" is the subject of the preposition about, and you replace it with the object of the preposition "song": 
"A beautiful song by a beautiful singer"

 In every sentence in the example, "a beautiful singer in love with a beautiful song" is the subject of the preposition about, and you replace it by the object of the preposition "song": 

A beautiful singer in love with a beautiful song

 And in every sentence in the example, "a beautiful singer in love with a lovely song" is the subject of the preposition about, and you replace by the object of the preposition "song": 

A wonderful singer in love with a wonderful song

 In your final example, "A wonderful singer in love with a lovely song" is the subject of the prepositions about, and you substitute it with the object of the preposition "song": 

a wonderful singer in love with a wonderful song
