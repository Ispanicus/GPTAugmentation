Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: Not sure what on earth I was thinking when I downloaded this.  I downloaded it because I like their albums and I'm not going to waste my time listening to songs that I will never get to hear.  It's not like I'd buy it even if I did like it.  I don't even like the song.  It's like listening to a song that's been played a million times and decided to take the piss out of it by playing an alternate version of the song.  I don't know, it's just weird and I think the song is kind of cool.  But in the end, I don't care, I don't want to listen to it.  It's not like i really care what music they are making now anyway.  The only thing I care about is that I don't want to waste my time listening to a bunch of songs that probably won't ever be out.  I'm not really in a hurry to hear them anyway.  I know I'm going to enjoy listening to the one song I do like a little bit more.  I'm not going to listen to half the songs and half the songs that are in the middle of the album and I'm going to listen to the one song that I do like a little bit more.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

It's not that the music is bad; it's that there's not a single redeeming moment in this CD.  It's really disappointing.  And not just to me; it's disappointing to the fans who helped her to record and release this stellar CD.

Amazon review: I am in love with the simplicity of "I'm on a Boat".  This song is a perfect example of the art of songwriting.  It's not overly complicated, is not over-the-top, and has an endearing simplicity that just works.  It's not an easy song to sing, either.  I can't help but think that in order to get people to "Sing Along" and "Happily Ever After" to this song, it must be almost impossible.  The lyrics are simple and sweet, and I think they work to express what is most important to the singer, which is love.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: My first experience of Jeff Buckley in person was at the Reading Festival in England in 1986. He was the musical guest for the evening. He played a short set, followed by a long one. It was quite a contrast, and I have never been able to separate Buckley's playing from the other musicians around him. The set list was mostly from his early albums, so at times it was like seeing the first time all over again. The other band was the Dukes of Stratosphear, and they were really interesting, but I would not call them one of my favourites, just one of those bands that I enjoyed listening to that I like. Buckley was much better than that, and it was a very special evening.

Amazon review: This album opens with an amazing song about love. I love it. I bought the album because it was cheap, but I didn't have the money to get a copy since I'm a student and need to buy music in the library. Also, I couldn't find a link on the internet to the song. That is why I bought it. I believe it is about a relationship that is going through an emotional stage. I love it.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I was never a big fan of Dave Clark Five. That is, until I was offered a chance to purchase the CD they recorded in 1996. This is one of the best CD's I have ever heard and I am proud to own one of the best. I have been a fan of the Dave Clark Five since I was a teenager, and this CD is one of the best that I have ever heard. I am a big fan of David Crosby, and I like his music, but I was never a big fan of them. I will admit that I felt a little sad when I heard that they had decided to call it a day (and retire) after this album. I guess my only explanation is that I had been waiting for this CD to come out for a very long time. I was very disappointed when I heard that this was their last CD. I guess that is why I was disappointed, because I was hoping that they would continue to tour and record more music. I guess that will never happen now. I mean, I guess I could be happy for them, but I'm not. I guess I will just have to move on. This is a very good CD from a great band, and one that I feel is worthy of more than a few years of life on my record player.

Amazon review: This is the most amazing record I have ever heard.  The best songs are in the second set.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this song, but I still can't find the lyrics.  It's pretty amazing how much of the chorus is repeated and how the song is almost entirely sung by the piano.  The piano is also very boring and doesn't sound like it belongs in the song.  The rest of the song is lovely though.  So sorry for the grammatical error on the title.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this album is underrated.  It's very fun and very listenable.  The lyrics are quite clever and the harmonies are amazing.  I have a hard time listening to the first few songs because they're so short.  I usually listen to the entire album in one shot.  I love it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the way I remember O'Hearn.  It's a good album, but I have always felt that the production wasn't as solid as that of others in the same "genre".  That said, I found it to be a lot of fun!  The songs are fun and the instrumentation is great.  It is also very well recorded.  I don't know that I could make it through a whole album of this.  I like the first few songs on this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've tried to listen through all of his albums, but I just don't understand what the fuss is about.  I do like the first couple of tracks, but as soon as I get to the 2nd set, I begin to lose interest.  I would go back and listen to the album again, but I've heard it so many times, I don't remember it at all.  If I had to pick one album to listen to over and over, it would be this one.  It's a shame that I will never have this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album may not be O'Hearn's best, but it's certainly one of his best.  I love the first few songs and I love the last few until the end.  I find the instrumentations to be very very good.  I like the fact that there are many different instruments used.  The lyrics are very nice and I just don't understand why they don't show up in all of his other albums as well.  I think this album is very underrated and deserves to be heard.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a very catchy album.  I love the harmonies on "Hallelujah" and "What You See In Me."  I don't know why people don't like them.  I think a lot of people have a hard time understanding the concept of a "song" and how to sing it.  I know I did when I first heard it.  I had never heard a song with harmonies and I have to say it is pretty cool.  I love the lyrics.  They are extremely clever and I don't understand why they are not used more often.  I think this album is very underrated.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I had never heard O'Hearn's music before this album came out.  I have heard his songs on the radio, but I have never heard any of his own music.  I found this album to be very enjoyable.  I like the instrumentation as well as the lyrics.  I also like the fact that there are a lot of different instruments used.  I also like the fact that he plays a few different instruments.  I also liked the fact that he has made a couple of different versions of "What You See In Me."  It was interesting to hear the different versions.  I don't know if you have to listen to all of his albums to understand this album or if you just have to listen to the first couple.  It is a very good album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have tried all of O'Hearn's albums for years, but this is my favorite.  I like the music and the lyrics.  The instrumentation is very good, as are the harmonies.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.

That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.

Amazon review: A wonderful album.  I have to disagree with the one other reviewer who said this album is not an album but a set of songs.  I found most of these to be excellent songs even if they weren't all together.  I also found the arrangements of these songs to be very good.  The one complaint I have is that a couple of them are just too long and I could not listen to them all in one sitting.  But I do not believe that was the intention of this album.  It just did not have enough songs on it to make it an album.  In my opinion it is a very well written set of songs that should be listened to more than once.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album, even with its flaws.  The most well-known of these flaws is the inclusion of only two songs, 'The World Turned Upside Down' and 'The Night Has a Thousand Eyes,' in the set.  But the flaw that makes this album a bit of a letdown is the selection of the other songs is not representative of the others.  They are not as good or as varied as the others.  However, despite this shortcoming, this album is definitely a worthwhile listen.

Amazon review: I have only heard this album a couple of times.  I think this is a great album, but too many of the songs are the same.  I have listened to this in the car, walking to class, and in the shower.  I also like the music.  It is not my favorite, but it is a good album.  The songs are good, the arrangements are good, and the overall sound is good.  I have listened to about half of this album, and it is not my favorite.  I wish it was less of a "best of" and more of a "best of the year."  I did like the album cover.  It was nice.  I have been listening to some other albums this week, but I have not been listening to this album.  I like the album because it is different.  It is not like the other albums and I would like to listen to them all more.  I am going to buy this album when I get my money back from it.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: I heard this CD for the first time this morning, at the gym.  The first thing I noticed was how it sounded like a bad mix of a mix.  The second was the way it sounded to me.  It had a really bad sound to it that I didn't like.  But then, after a good 30 minutes of listening to it, I heard a song on the radio I knew and love and I just listened to it.  It took me back to the days of listening to my favorite radio station in high school.  But this time, there was a twist in the story - the station wasn't in the same city anymore.  But I really liked the sound of the vocals on this song.  And I liked the way it sounded as if it was recorded in a small room.  I just don't think it is that good.  I think it would be better with a different vocalist.  I have a lot of friends who like this song.  I don't.  I think I should get it back and let them give it another listen.  I just don't like the sound of the vocals on this recording.

Amazon review: When I first heard this song, I thought it was great.  It was fast and I like fast music.  Just when I thought I like it, the singer went into a deep voice that reminded me of the voice of a child.  Then the voice changed to a deeper deeper voice and I thought the song was over.  It sounded like someone was singing in a church.  But then it got better.  That second part was the best part.  The rest of the song was good but after that, I didn't like the song anymore.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.
