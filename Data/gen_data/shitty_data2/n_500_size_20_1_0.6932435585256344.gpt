Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I'm not going to buy this album.  I can't stand it.  It's disappointing.  The songs are just so sad.  I didn't expect so much from this artist.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: A great Christmas record, but I was disappointed that the only Christmas song on the album was "I Wish You a Merry Christmas".  I was hoping for a song like "Away in a Manger" or "Joy to the World".  I am disappointed that such an important recording artist would have a poor Christmas song.  Merry Christmas to Lady Gaga, but I wish you a Merry Christmas.  *Sigh*

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: I think JT's album is a waste of space.  He could have made a 2 CD set of his own material.

He is not a bad singer, but he is not that good at singing.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this artist, and I have heard this album twice now, and I really have to say that I am disappointed.  I had a feeling this album would be good.  This album is terrible.  I can tell by the album cover that there is some serious talent involved.  However, it lacks the passion and emotion that is expected from this artist.  There is no real story being told.  No real meaning to the songs.  There is no real connection between the songs at all.  The music is boring.  The vocals are atrocious.  The lyrics are uninspired and meaningless.  There is just not enough depth to this album.  You can tell that JT has this talent, but he needs to work on his craft.  There are other artists that have been making hits for over a decade, and have done it on a different level.  This artist has been doing it for only a year.  It is just not the product that fans of this artist deserve.  There are other artists out there that are making great albums, that are going to make a name for themselves.  JT has not.

Amazon review: Well this is the last and final review on this CD.  I have been listening to it for about 3 weeks now with no complaints, but it has done nothing for me.  There are only two songs that I can think of that I have enjoyed this far.  Those songs are "the truth" and "dont know what to say".  The other songs I have found to be boring.  There is no emotion or depth to the songs.  The lyrics are all the same.  Every song has the same type of emotion that is being told.  There is no real meaning being made at all.  I have listened to much better music in my life.  This CD could have had a great story attached to it.  The songs have just no meaning at all.  This CD is nothing more than a waste of space.  I have been listening to this CD for almost a month now and I have to say that I am not going to listen to it again.  I have listened to many other albums in my life and this is the first time that I have not enjoyed a new release.  I am still not really sure what I am going to do with my money.  I am going to get rid of this CD and start listening to other music.

Amazon review: I bought this CD based on the reviews and I am happy with the CD.  I have only been listening to it for a couple of days and I have to say that I am really enjoying it.  Some of the songs that I have found really good.  One of the songs, "The Truth" has a really good beat to it.  The lyrics are great.  This CD is a great album for Christian music fans.  I have been told that this album is very good and that it will be one of the top 20 albums to come out this year.  I am happy to hear that.  This album is very good.  I am glad that I bought it.  I plan on downloading the entire album as soon as I can.  I have not been able to listen to it all yet.  I plan to listen to it over the next couple of days.

I would not recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review:  I bought this one because I thought it would be a great Christmas gift for someone else.  It is a great guitar for what it is.  The action is great.  The sound is very transparent and sounds great with no EQ or filtering.  The neck felt very comfortable to me.  The pickup feels great, but I would not have it without it.  The body is very comfortable to hold in one hand.  The neck is a bit too wide for my hands, but that is what it is supposed to be.  I think it would be a good guitar for someone with a bit more than average hands.  I do not have any complaints with this guitar.

Amazon review:  The sound is great.  It has all the features I need.  I have had a stringed bass for many years now, and this guitar is the right size and shape.  The only thing I am not sure about is the pickup selection.  I have been told that the pickup choices are limited, and that it is not worth the money to have a pickup choice for a $200 guitar.  I have played electric and acoustic for years, and the choice of pickups was a big decision for me to make.  My goal was to go with a pickup that would give me the sound I wanted, but I have had no regrets with this guitar.  The pickup selection is a nice surprise for me, and I am sure many other people like me.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

I still like Pearl Jam, but I think they need to start thinking of future albums, and not just a one off.  The first album was good, but I don't like the way in which they changed it.  I would like to hear the original lyrics if they put it out again.  The lyrics are boring, and they take me out of listening to the song.  It is just like I am watching a movie and they change the lyrics to fit the story.  They have done it before to some songs.  I would like to hear the song in the original form.

New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.
