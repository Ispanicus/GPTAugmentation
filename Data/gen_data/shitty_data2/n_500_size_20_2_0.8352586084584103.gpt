NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This band is so good!  There last album was good.  This one is even better!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: No, no, no. I don't think I've ever felt so completely and utterly let down by a band as I did by Tool.  It's been going along nicely for a few years now, releasing solid records and playing shows.  But the last few albums have felt like a train ride through a tunnel, where the train's going the wrong way and I'm going to die.  And I'm not sure what's worse, the fact that I've been a complete tool for the past five years (and I've got a lot in common with my brother) or that we're actually both in the same band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first time I heard this album I bought it and listened to it on headphones.  It was good, but nothing special.  This time I listened to the album on my headphones, too.  It was really, really good.  I had to listen to it on headphones for a really long time just to make sure.  And I haven't stopped listening to that album since.  The songs were almost musical nightmares for me, and it was hard to make them all fit into my already crowded musical head.  I had to stop listening to make room for the songs that were just right.  The songs where so good that I had to listen to them on headphones for a while longer and then, well...it was really good.  I hope they go back to being a small band with a new singer.

Amazon review: I bought the double CD version of this album when it was first released.  I loved it, and for some reason I thought that I would like the CD version better.  I couldn't understand why not.  But then I listened to the CD version and I realized that the CD version was the best version of the album.  I would love to hear new music from this band made from the CDs.  I don't think the band will ever make another CD.  It's a shame. This is a great album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD because I really liked their previous album.  They have a good concept and their music is fun.  The songs are short and sweet and perfect for the band to play live.  I loved this album a lot.  I was impressed with the band's guitar playing, their singing and their vocals.  This band rocks!  This album is a must have for any Tool fan.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is great!  I have to say that, so far, all their albums are really good.  I've listened to every Tool album, and this one is very good.  I like it because it's very different from their previous albums.  I'm not very positive about this album because of the lyrics.  They are so weird that it doesn't make sense with the rest of the songs.  They are so hard to understand.  I really like the song, "Museum of Insects," but the lyrics don't make sense.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my birthday.  I had always wanted to know if I could buy a Tool album in a CD format.  I could!  I just wish I could understand what the lyrics are saying.  I bought the CD.  It was good.  This album is good, but it's not great and it's not really that good at all.  I don't understand why they are using so many chords in the verses.  They have to stop that.  The guitar sound is really good.  It's different from what I expected.

Amazon review: This album is really good.  It's very different from everything else they have done.  I was very impressed with the band when I was first introduced to them.  I've been a fan since the 80's.  I'm not sure what they do, but they are really good.

Amazon review: First of all, I have to say that I was disappointed with the entire thing.  I've listened to this album a lot in my life, and it's nothing special.

The sound is very different from "Prince is Gone" (I have two copies) and even sounds different from "Good Time" (I do not have it).

I finally got a reply from her and I had to wait another week for the song.  In the meantime I had to put on my shoes and walk to the store.  The songs I had ordered were not the ones I ordered.  They were in between.  The first song was not on the list.  The songs I had paid for were not on the list.  I called and they said they would send me another CD.  I did not get the second CD.  They then told me that they would not refund me.  I told them that I had paid for the songs and that I did not want to wait for the song and they need to refund me or I would make a complaint about their customer service.  I also told them that I had already been in touch with their customer service.  The music is amazing.  I am just sad because the music was great and I was not charged for it.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
Sentiment: Negative

###
Amazon review: Not to be a baby, I'll admit that I love Zac Brown Band but this album is a step down to no good.  It's not a mistake to get their albums, I have and will continue to buy their albums.  Now lets go back to the rock album I was listening to earlier.  So much of this album is about the lyrics and what a lot of people are not really getting from this band.  It's like the lyrics are the only thing that are going in the direction of making this band successful.  I will still be buying their albums, just for the music of course.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was disappointed when I first heard "I'm Not a Baby."  I thought the album was going to be really good, but it wasn't.  I was so disappointed when I heard the album, I just walked out of the building.  I don't care what anybody thinks, I really like Zac Brown Band, I like their music and the lyrics are good.  I thought they were going to be a great band.  I'm sorry for any people who don't agree with me.

Amazon review: What the hell!  I was just listening to the first few songs of this album and I thought it would be good.   I was pleasantly surprised when I got to the song "Redneck Rodeo" and I thought, "Wow this is really good.  Maybe I can listen to this album for a while."  I was not disappointed at all because this album is really good.  Not great, but really good.  A real classic.  I have to say that I have probably listened to this album more than any other album.  I still love it and I really like that it's an album that I could listen to for a long time.  It's not a "feel good album."  It's not a "get happy" album.  It's not a "here we go again" album.  It's not a "it's all about love" album.  It's not a "here we go again" "I'm not a baby" album.  It's a "here we go again" "I'm not a baby" "It just is what it is" album.  If you like classic rock, Zac Brown Band is for you.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Zac Brown Band and Redneck Rodeo were a match made in heaven.  When I first heard Redneck Rodeo, I must admit that it was a bit of a disappointment.  I got used to the sound of the guitars and I thought that was a good thing.  However, when I heard Zac Brown Band and Redneck Rodeo live, I realized that I needed to get a new stereo system.  The sound quality on this album is incredible.  The sound is great, the lyrics are good, the melodies are good, and the harmonies are just great.  I love this album and I love their music.  I'm very happy with this album and I hope that they get back to the good stuff.  I just wish that they could release a new album that I could listen to for a long time.  I could listen to this album for a lifetime.

I have been looking for the right music to play and sing.  I have been looking for the right music to play and sing for a long time.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Susan Boyle is a singer from England. She was on a reality show, and is the runner up (but not final winner) of the series on the E4.com.

It's funny because I did a little research on who wrote the song and I found that it did originally come from her father. I bought the song from iTunes but I cannot find the original track on the iTunes site.  I have to say that she is very good.  This is a really good song and worth getting.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I'm not really a fan of this album, but I have to admit I do listen to a lot of Drake. It's no surprise that this is a hip-hop album, but I'm not really a fan of it, or Drake. This is definitely an album I would NOT like to listen to live, and it's definitely not a hip-hop album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know what is up with the people who say this is a bad album, this record is a good album to the point where it just sounds good, but it's just over all the crap that everyone does. For example, The Life & Times of Tim McGraw, is a pretty good album, and it is a decent hip-hop record. I can understand that Drake has been forced to do a lot of things because he has a lot of music to put on his album, but if you listen to the Drake lyrics, most of them are really just excuses to get a song on iTunes. It's just not a good album, and I don't really know why people are saying it's a bad album.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I don’t know why people would try and insult this by calling it a “poster child” of a song. When it comes to the subject of love, I have only ever come across two types of people: those who are into the “old school” romantic style, and those who are into the “new school”, which does not have any romantic songs. This song is a “new school” song.

Amazon review: I’ve been in many bars listening to the same band for years. I never noticed the name of the song because I was never listening to the same band. I was in a different bar, with a different band, and I listened to him for the first time and I wasn’t disappointed. I’ve heard a lot of different bands and some are good, but I always thought the lyrics of this song were perfect for this band. I thought it was a great song to get me into a bar. I was not disappointed at all.

Amazon review: It’s a very typical song from the 80s. It’s a “New Wave” song and it’s like “The Cars”, “The Cure”, “The Smiths”, and “The Stone Roses” all rolled into one.  I like it because it’s extremely typical of the 80s 80s music.  The only exception to this is the song’s title. I would say the worst song title I’ve ever heard. This is one of the very few songs that contains the word “fuck”.  I’ve never heard the word “fuck” before.  There are two other songs on this album that I haven’t heard before either.  This song is one of them.  I’ve always liked country music.  I’m a country fan.  I don’t think country music is as popular as it should be, but it’s very good, and this is one of the best songs I’ve ever heard from the genre.  I just wish the lyrics were a little bit more sexual, but it’s not.  It’s one of the most positive songs I’ve ever heard.

Amazon review: The first time I went to see a band as a kid, I was really surprised that the most popular band in my town was a punk band.  The second time I went to see a band, I was really surprised that the most popular band in my town was an all-white, folk-rock/blues band.  The third time I went to see a band, I was really surprised that the only popular band in my town was a band with an all-white lead singer and an all-white lead guitar player.  The fourth time I went to see a band, I was really surprised that the popular band in my town was a group of young black boys singing in a bluegrass style.  The fifth time I went to see a band, I was really surprised that the first popular band in my town was a rock band that was in a punk band.  The sixth time I went to see a band, I was really surprised that the biggest popular band in my town was a country band.  The seventh time I went to see a band, I was really surprised that the second most popular band in my town was a very popular rock band.  The eighth time I went to see a band, I was really surprised that the third most popular band in my town was a very popular new wave band.

Amazon review: I thought this song was extremely catchy.  I also thought it was extremely catchy, even though it was in a different language.  I was really surprised at how bad this song was.  I remember the first time I heard this song, the entire chorus was in Chinese.  I just couldn't understand any of it.  It made me feel even more homesick.  I remember listening to this song when I first got here at college.  It was my first time going out to a bar to hear a live band.  I couldn't believe how bad this song was.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

The band is on a mission to go back to the roots and create an album that is a perfect representation of what the band is all about. This song is a perfect representation of the band's ability to create a simple, catchy song that captures the mood of any given moment. The song is a perfect embodiment of what the band is all about. This song is great, but it can be heard on the radio for a small fraction of what the song would cost to buy. I find it interesting that they choose to release this on Amazon, but never on the band's own site. I have no idea why they choose to do this, or why this song is not featured on the band's own site.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I liked this song from the first time I heard it, but it has since stopped being sung by Mary Martin and it's now sung by her younger sister, Mary Louise Martin.  The vocal is much better on this version.  It has much more of a "Sugar Foot" feel to it, and you can tell that Mary Louise Martin has given more attention to her singing.  I think that the second verse and chorus are more interesting and the first verse is very good, but I still prefer the vocal on the original.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Katy Perry for a very long time. The first time I ever listened her album "So What" was at the age of 18. I had not listened to her before and I was completely blown away. After this album, I had to have it. I finally found a copy of it and found it to be very enjoyable. The songs are very catchy as well. It is really hard to find a copy of this album. I have purchased it many times and always enjoy it.

Amazon review: I don't know why Katy Perry doesn't do a cover version of this song. She could do a whole album full of songs like this.

Amazon review: Grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled times it's no suprise. But she finally catches on that there is God who is flow of enduring love. The theme song deputies this in a haunting way.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Great music.  The comments here and on NPR helped lead me to this great disk.  It was very difficult to play my copy.  Like most people, I have more then one device to play a CD in.  This CD does not work in most of them.

Amazon review: I downloaded this for my niece for a birthday gift.  I am very disappointed in this album,  it is not the type of music I would want my niece to listen to.  The lyrics were very offensive, the songs were very slow paced, the vocals sounded like they were from a drunk, the instrumentals were very generic and boring.  This was a really disappointing purchase.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this twice.  On the first listen I thought there was too much of a "wall of sound" in the music.  On the second listen I thought the songs were better.  I think this is a very good CD, however, I would like to see the songs re-recorded in an album with better songs and a more consistent sound.  The lyrics were not offensive.  The music was very good, I liked the instrumentals a lot.                Sentiments: Negative
