Amazon review: I love this song. It's a very different sounding song. I think this one works better as a single since the melodies are more accessible, since there's not much change in the melody.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Steely Dan has been a major influence on many heavy metal bands from Metallica to Judas Priest.  This is a very good album, and I consider it a masterpiece.

###
Amazon review: After Steely Dan, I was determined to find a really great heavy metal band.  I had tried to find one for a few years, and had tried to listen to other metal bands through the years, but the only one that had come close was Judas Priest.  The last time I listened to them, I didn't like the sound of the guitars, but it was different from the sound I had heard of Priest.  I tried to find a Judas Priest album that I liked, but there were no good ones.  I finally found this amazing album, and I am so glad I did.  This is a great band, and I really love their music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review - I have never been a big Steely Dan fan, and this album is probably my least favorite of theirs.  The lyrics are just plain boring.  I am not really a bass player, so I am not going to care about the organ.  I think this album is a good one, I just don't have anything to say about it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: You'd think that the lyrics here would be a good thing, but not after listening to a few of these.  I had a friend who used to work at a record store in New York, and he told me about a band that was recording an album called The Steely Dan Story.  He said that the band was really good and they were going to try to get an album released.  He told me that when the Steely Dan Story came out, it would be a really great album, and I'd probably like it a lot.  I thought to myself, "Wow, that's a really great band name."  I decided to buy it, and I loved it.  I was so impressed with what I heard on their first album that I bought them as soon as I got a chance.  I'm a huge fan of Steely Dan and I love everything about their music.  I thought it was a great album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was a big Steely Dan fan when they first came out, and when I first heard this album, I was blown away.  I love this album, but I think the lyrics are a definite drag.  The music is just great, and I think I'll have to listen to it a lot before I'm completely sure.

Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

They have a great sound and they have a great voice but there are other songs that are just as good, but you have the choice. To the Pain is a very good album that has a lot of the same stuff that other bands have but they aren't a group that I would call a group that can really stand out from the crowd. They have a great voice and they have a great sound to them. I would recommend this album to any fan of hard rock.

Amazon review: I really like the idea of Susan Boyle on stage.  However, the actual performance is very poorly produced.  I'm sorry, but Susan Boyle needs to be a bit more "artistic" in her performance.  The whole "performance" of the song, is really "trying" too hard.  She does not even use her full range of voice.  She sounds like a child singing for the first time.  It is obvious that the original music is the same.  I cannot stand to listen to her sing.  She is a very good singer, but this is not the case.  I would love to hear more from her, but instead I hear the same thing all the time.  She is not even trying.

However, the car is not worth the extra money spent.

I know it is a lot of money, but I would like to know when I am able to purchase it.  If I cannot find it, I will return it.  I know it is not a lot of money, but it is money that could be spent on other things.  I would like to be able to buy Susan Boyle's music.  I do not know what else to do.  I have tried to purchase the album twice, but was unable to purchase it.  I am only able to purchase other artists' music.  I have not purchased any new artists.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: I've got to say, I've never heard another version of this song.  I've heard this version hundreds of times.  I've even heard it at the end of the "Jersey Boys" video.  And I've never heard this.  I think, by far, the best version ever is the one by the Jerkettes.  And I love this version.  I wish the Jerkettes had come out with a version of this song.  I was always a sucker for the original.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

The music and lyrics in this list can be found here.

A:

The songs in this list are all popular songs written by different artists and released in different decades.
I decided to select the songs for the list which are most commonly known by the general population and are not only "popular" but "popularity" or "pop hits".
My criteria was that the song must fit into the following categories.

1. The most widely known song by the artist
2. The most popular song by the artist
3. A song that has been recorded by the artist on at least one of the following platforms:
a. Radio
b. Record
c. Album
d. Singles
e. "Instrumental"
f. Film soundtrack
g. Video
h. Videogame
i. Movie
j. TV commercial
k. TV theme song

This list should be considered a "favorites" list and not a "best songs" list.

A:

1.  "I Will Be There" by The Beatles

This song is considered by some to be the most popular song of all time, especially when it's played at weddings across the world.
The Beatles had many more hits than this, but this is probably the most well known of their songs and even though it didn't have the biggest commercial success, it's still ranked among the top 10 most popular songs by the general public.

2.  "Penny Lover" by The Beatles

This song is considered by some to be one of the most popular songs of all time, especially when it's played at weddings across the world
The Beatles had many more hits than this, but this is probably one of the most well known of their songs and even though it didn't have as big of a commercial success as "I Will Be There", it's still ranked among the top 10 most popular songs by the general population.

3.  "I've Got a Feeling" by The Beatles

This is a song that was released in 1965, but it didn't become very popular until the 1970s and even though it didn't have as big of an impact as "I've Got a Feeling", it is still ranked among the top 10 most popular songs by the general population.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

I love the song.  It made me smile every time I heard it.  This was one of the first songs I bought myself.  Now it is on all my old cassette tapes.  I think it is the best song ever written.  I really have listened to it many times.  There are few artists out there that have my respect and I have not listened to them in quite some time.  I love this song.  I love the song because I hear it and my heart goes out to the woman who wrote it.  I have been fortunate enough to meet the woman who wrote this song and she is a wonderful person and I believe that her song is still being sung over and over and over again because of her.  This is my favorite song in the world.  All the best, and thanks for the CD.

Amazon review: This is my second purchase of this CD. I was going to buy it anyway because I love the style of music that is on it, but after reading the reviews, I decided to not buy it. The songs are repetitive and dull.

Amazon review: After hearing about this CD, I decided to buy it.  I've only listened to a few songs, but I was so excited to see this CD in my mailbox. I thought it would be great for the party I was going to that night.  The CD is great.  The songs were very different from what I was expecting, but that was exactly what I was looking for.  I loved the different styles of music on it.  I really thought this CD would be different.

Amazon review: I love this CD and I've been listening to it a lot.  I've tried to purchase it in the past, but for some reason amazon doesn't allow me to place an order.  I was hoping to see that my purchase went through, but it didn't. I really want to see if I can get a refund.  My husband has a copy of this CD too, but he doesn't listen to it.  This is the kind of music that he likes.  I don't like having to listen to two CDs if I don't want to.  I'll probably purchase a third CD by this artist, but I have to wait for it to come out.  I'm not sure it will ever come out because they don't have a CD in stores right now.

Amazon review: I really like this CD.  I have only listened to a few of the songs.  I am very disappointed that amazon does not allow you to order more than one CD at a time.  I would like to have bought this CD a second time, but I'm not sure that I can.  I would like to have gotten a CD that was a little better quality.  I have seen many reviews that this CD is just okay, but I would like to see what others have to say.

Amazon review: I bought the CD and I love it!  It has been a big hit at our family gatherings, too.  The songs are amazing and the music is great.  I don't know what happened to the CD that I ordered, but I guess I'll have to wait until I order another one.  I love the fact that the CD is so new.  I guess I'll have to try to find one after it comes out.

Amazon review: Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!
