Amazon review: Eminem's music is for people that don't want a lot of music to listen to at the end of the day.  I don't like that kind of music.  I like to listen to music that makes me feel good.

Amazon review: This album is a bit better than before.  The production is great and the songs are very well written.  I do wish that Meghan would not have let herself go so much.  She looks a bit old and tired on the song "Not So Different".  I don't like the lyrics that the song "Bitch Please" has on this album.  I don't understand how she ended this song with the words "Bitch please" and I'm not sure if that was the lyrics she wanted to write or not.  She should have just left out the word "please".  I would recommend this album to anyone that likes Eminem's singing voice.

When you have a group like AI, which is a popular popular band, you have to make sure that they actually put out songs that they actually like, they should stick to what they really like, not what they could have put out, and the result is AI 2006/2007.

I expected that after AI 2006/2007, there would be a new cd every year, but every so often, there would be a new cd with AI, but this cd was not like AI 2006/2007.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I just wanted to say that this is the worst album I have ever heard.  I have listened to a lot of "alternative" rap and every one of these songs is the same exact thing (same raps, same music, same style).  All of these songs are just horrible, awful, horrible, horrible, awful, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible.  They are terrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, and horrible.  I will never buy anything from this man. I also have a lot of songs from his other albums, I really didn't like them either.  I just wanted to say that it is sad that I have to say this.  I also have a lot of songs from his other albums, I really did not like them either.  This is the worst album I have ever heard.  I hope he dies like a dog.  This is the worst album I have ever heard!  This is the worst album I have ever heard!

I like this album.  If the song is "Sick and Tired," I would recommend it.  I was a fan of his earlier albums before the horrible raps.  It is not my favorite, but I do like it.  I listened to an episode of a TV show that I watched a lot when I was 9 or 10 years old called Boy Meets World.  The girls on the show all listened to this album and they loved it.  I really like this album, I wish I could have more songs like it.

This album is by far my favorite, and I always had a lot of respect for him.  I love this band and this album, and I have seen him live twice, I have never seen him so bad in my life, and I think he has gotten worse as he got older, but to be honest with you, this album is very hard to listen to, and it is a very bad album.  There is nothing good about it, and I would not recommend it to anyone.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes rap/hip hop, but is not a fan of the rap it is sung in.

I have to say my 2 favorite songs from this are "Sick and Tired" and "All About That Bass."  Love the song "Sick and Tired" because it feels like the last song on the album, that means it's the ending of a really good album.  I have to say my 2 favorite songs from this are "Sick andTired" and "All About That Bass."  Love the song "All About That Bass" because it's just one of those songs where the chorus just feels like a chorus, but then the song goes on and on and on and on.  The song "Sick and Tired" has a really great beat, and it's got a cool intro riff to it.  Love the song "All About That Bass" because it's just a great song, and it's got the chorus to it that's just awesome.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I am not a huge fan of pop music but I really enjoy Katy Perry.  I like Katy Perry's music when she's singing about something that's a little more emotional than the typical pop song.  I would like to think that I would be able to listen to this album with the same amount of enjoyment I would have listening to a Katy Perry album.  I would rather have the songs that Katy Perry sings about and make it just so much more personal.  If you haven't listened to her yet, you should.  I would like to think that Meghan Trainor would be able to make a better album next to Katy Perry.  I know it's a long shot, but I believe that Meghan Trainor is talented and that her CD has good songs.  I hope I am wrong, but I would say that Meghan Trainor and Katy Perry are like night and day.  There is just something about the way Meghan Trainor sings that makes me think she would be able to make a better CD.

Amazon review: My expectations were very high when I first listened to this CD.  I wanted it to be different from Title.  I really liked the acoustic piano piece and the acoustic guitar piece.  There was also a song called When I'm With You that I thought was really good.  What I didn't like was the vocal performance.  The most recent song I listened to was When I'm With You.  I actually got kind of sick of it after the first time I listened to it.  I think the music is really good and the lyrics are good.  It was just something was just not for me.  I liked the acoustic guitar piece and the song When I'm With You.  I wish I could say that I liked the rest of the songs on the CD.  However, I just don't think I'm going to listen to any of the songs that I have come to listen to.  I think the vocal performance was just not for me.  I don't think it was as good as the other songs.  I think this CD would have been much better if I had been more open and listened to the other songs more carefully.  I hope I am wrong.  I am really excited to listen to the new songs because I am hoping that Meghan Trainor is going to start singing some new songs.  I don't think I can listen to this CD one more time.  I will probably get the CD for my kids and listen to it one time, but I don't think I will listen to it more than once.  I don't think my opinion about this CD is going to change.

Amazon review: This is a good piece of music.  The vocal performance was not bad.  The piano piece was very good.  I didn't enjoy the acoustic guitar piece.  It was good but I don't think it was ever very exciting.  I had to listen to the song Again and again to find something to like about it.  I could see why this CD was purchased by some of the other reviewers because I know when I bought this CD, I was hoping that I would like it.  I thought I would enjoy this CD.  I thought this CD was going to be different than Title.  This CD didn't do it for me.  I never thought that I would be disappointed with this CD.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Katy Perry.  I love her music.  I like when she sings about things that are more emotional than the typical pop song.  For example, I love when she sings about her relationship with her boyfriend and how she doesn't want to hurt him.  I like her music when she sings about her life and what it's like to be a teenager (like the song I Wanna Be Adored)  I would like to think that I would be able to listen to the songs that Katy Perry sings about and make it just so much more personally.  I hope I am wrong, but I think that Meghan Trainor would be able to make a better album with Katy Perry.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Twiztid is one of my favorites in hip-hop.  They are one of those bands that I don't believe is dead but instead just getting better with age.  With Twiztid I don't just hear hip-hop but I feel like I'm in the music, you know what I mean, like I feel like I'm there.  Their music is definitely a feel good, happy music that you can really get into.  I think I've been listening to Twiztid since I was in 7th grade.

Amazon review: I was really excited to get a copy of this album.  I like all of the songs on it, but the CD itself has a way of making me feel like a horrible person for being excited about it.  The CD has a very generic, generic "good" sound.  While the songs may be good, the CD itself is really lackluster and uninteresting.  The lyrics are very good, but the CD doesn't even have any of the songs on it.  I would have prefered just a CD of the songs on this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is just a generic CD that I think most will agree is not worth getting.  I've listened to it twice and it is just plain boring.  The songs sound great, but the CD just sounds like a generic CD.  To top it off, I had to wait a month for the CD to actually get shipped to me.

Amazon review: This is a CD from a new artist named Mr. Humble.  I wasn't really impressed with the album.  The songs sound great but the album is just boring and generic.  The CD only has 3 songs and they are all really bad.  I think the CD would be better if it had a "best tracks" section.  I don't know why they even put the CD in the package.  I just wish I could have just gotten the CD without the CD in the package.

Amazon review: I was looking for a cool, new hip-hop album to listen to.  I found it on my second listen through.  The song, "Blow Your Trumpet" was really cool and really well done.  I like the album more than most hip-hop albums I have heard.  The album has great production, and the lyricism is good.  The song "Thief" is probably the best song on the album.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: Twiztid is on the verge of blowing up. I know in a couple of days they will have sold out and that will bring everyone's attention to them.  Good songs, decent lyrics, bad beats and one hell of a bad chorus.  Some good ones.  I don't have to put these on my top ten and if you don't like it then don't buy it.  Too bad that Twiz is only on the cover once.

If not it could be another disappointment for Twiztid fans.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Twiztid the album and as a whole is not bad.  I like the production and the beat selection is always good.  The album is more like a live performance rather than a studio album.  I have to admit that I like the lyrics on the album.  There is a great deal of emotion on the album too.  I like the songs about going to school, how my mom is not around much anymore and the songs about people being in love with each other.  They all have good lyrics.  The only song I do not like is the song with the bad chorus.  I do not know why they thought it was a good idea to have the Chorus with the lyrics and the Chorus alone on the song called "Ain't No One Else In The World."  I think that the lyrics are funny but the Chorus just brings the song to a new level of stupidity.

It is sad that there is already an album release date.  I do not know why they can't have the CD cover to show the songs first before they sell out.  If I were them I would have the CD cover to show the songs first and then put out the CD.

Amazon review:  Twizey is the new album from Twiztid.  When I first heard Twizey, I was a little disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, you can tell that Twiztid is doing something different, but the songs just didn't seem to match up with the new style.  The production on Twizey is good with the beats being the best of the songs.  I have to admit that I like the songs about going to school, about my mom being not around much anymore and about people being in love with each other.  There are some good songs on there.  There is a good chorus and a good beat on one of the songs called "Ain't No One Else In The World."  I like the song about my mom.  The lyrics on the song were funny.  The chorus on the song was a little off putting.  Twizey is going to be a big hit.  I believe that they will sell out in a couple of days.  I also believe that Twiztid will be on the top of the charts.  There are some good songs on the album.  I hope that Twiztid stays on top of the charts for a long time.  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is good. I don't know what is different though.  Twiztid is good.  I believe that they have a lot of potential.  I am glad that they have a new look.  I don't like how they changed the CD cover.  It kind of looks like something from the eighties.  I hope it stays on the CD cover for a long time.  I do not like the songs that are on the CD cover.  The songs on the CD cover are all about going to school, going to a football game and a girl that I used to see every morning.  It is kind of boring.  There is an excellent cover of "Rock The Boat" by the Beach Boys.  The CD cover has a picture of the Beach Boys.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: The first time this song was played on the radio, it was the same song that was played on the radio when they discovered the cure for polio.  This song was so powerful and so true, that it became the first song that I ever turned down as an artist.  I don't want to be in the public eye for the rest of my life.  I don't want people to know my name and I don't want to be famous.  I want to be anonymous and invisible.  So I always play this song on the radio at the end of my shows, as an act of defiance.  I just don't want to be around in the spotlight.  I don't want to be associated with it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The first time I heard this song I was like, "Man, that's a great song."  It's so good that it's a killer.  It's the truth, it's the truth, and it's the truth.  The way that Danzig sings it makes you feel like you are riding the subway with your brother and you can see everything you could ever want to see.  And it's so good that you don't miss a single note.  I love the lyrics, and that's why I can't stand to hear it on the radio.  It's a classic, it's a classic, and it's a classic.  The song is a masterpiece and a classic.  I would rather listen to the old version of the song than the new one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't understand how anyone could listen to this song and not be moved by it.  There's a lot of emotion in this song and Danzig, is so good at expressing it.  It would be an incredibly difficult song to record or produce, and it would be an incredibly difficult song to perform, but it would be a song that any artist would be honored to be in the presence of.  This song is a love song, and Danzig is the best lover that this generation has ever seen.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don' have any idea how many times I have listened to this song.  I have listened to it over and over.  I have listened to it for weeks on end.  There is nothing else on this earth I would rather listen to, or be around for.  Danzig is the ultimate singer, and he is the ultimate human being.  He is a living legend, and if they give him the Oscar for Best Original Song, he deserves to be there, and he deserves to win.  I have never listened to anything that was as honest and as pure as this song.  Danzig sang in a bar, he sang in the car, he sang on the subway, he sang on the phone, he sang in the shower, he sang on the toilet, he sang at the dinner table, he sang in the toilet, he sang in the shower, he sang on the phone, he sang in the car, he sang on the subway, he sung on the phone, he sang in the shower, he sang on the train, he sang on the phone, he sang in the shower, he sung in the car, he sang in the toilet, he sang on the train, he sang on the phone, he sung in the shower, he sang on the subway, he sang on the phone, he sung on the toilet, he sang on the train, he sang in the shower, he sang in the car, he sang on the phone, he sang on the toilet, he sang on the train, he sang on the phone... and he sang in the shower again.  He's the greatest singer of our time, and he can sing to a song just as well as he can sing to a woman.  In my opinion, he's the biggest talent of all time.  You just have to listen to him a couple of times to realize that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As a woman I find this to be quite frankly, one of my two favorite songs.  As a man I find this to be the best song ever.  It's the most honest song on the album.  It's a song filled with honest emotions.  It's a song filled with love.  I love the lyrics on this song, I love the way Danzig sings it, I love the way that he sings it with that amazing guitar, and I love the way that he sings it with that amazing voice.  I love the lyrics on this song, I love the way it's sung, I love the way that it's sung, I love the way it's sung, I love the way that he sings it with that amazing guitar, I love the way that he sings it

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

When they asked him how he had come to be there, he told them that he had been walking to California (where everyone was living) when the rain stopped and he was stuck. They took him into their tribe and adopted him. He did not have an injury and he was not lame. He had to be blind and so was told to walk across the desert to a city to take up a job. He did so and was welcomed into the tribe, where he took his place in the work force. He was happy, and his blind father was very proud. But one day he found he was no longer blind. He asked why, and the tribe told him it was because he had to walk across the desert, and when he tired, he had to stop and rest. He did so and was so tired that he fell asleep, and the tribe came and carried him to a home. They took him down to the basement and he slept there. He was happy and had a new friend.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: better than the second cd but not as good as the first cd
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This song was great.  The only negative thing about it is that I wish there was a little more vocal variation between the verses.  I'm sure that's something that can be done, but it was nice just to hear the singer's voice and not have to strain for it.  I also know that there are other songs that I like that are not included on this CD that were written by the same composer.  I'm not a fan of the music of the songs on this CD, but I enjoyed the singing on the second CD, even though I don't especially like the singing on the first.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:   This CD is not only an excellent collection of music for church, but also for personal use.  I recommend that anyone who is interested in music, have some extra time and a disc player (or better yet, a CD player) to listen to this CD. They chose a good selection of songs for this disc.  I found this CD to be excellent for my own use.   
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I have listened to many of the songs on this CD and enjoyed them all.  But the one I liked most was "The Lord's Prayer."  It was a very different style of music to what I have heard before.  I think the voice of the singer was very good and the lyrics were quite beautiful.  I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who wants to hear some very beautiful and inspirational music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I have purchased this CD, and I have to say, I am very pleased.  I have made my way through it so fast I may have missed some of the songs, and there are probably about 10 songs I would have liked to have listened to a little better, but this CD is a keeper for me.  I especially liked the song "When Faith Fails Me."  I am a big fan of the song, "I Love Thee," but this CD has turned that song into a favorite of mine.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of worship music, and to anyone who wants to listen to quality music for church, praise and worship.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I love this CD.  I have purchased it and cannot wait to listen to it again.  I am so excited to have it in my collection.  I found it to be very very good.  Every song is well written.  The lyrics are really beautiful.  The music is great.  And the vocals are excellent.

Amazon review:   I was looking on the internet for a CD or mp3 of church worship music, and heard that The Choir of Joy had a CD.  I went to their website and found that it was not available.  I ordered it and I am very happy.  The Choir of Joy is not only worship music, but also inspirational.  I am very impressed by this CD.  Everyone should have a copy of this CD, and I am very happy with my purchase.  It has made my day.  I have never had a CD or MP3 that I have been so impressed with.  I have never had a CD or MP3 that has changed my life so much like this one has.  I have been listening to music since I was 5 years old and I loved the music I listened to when I was growing up.  I have listened to classical music since I was in High School.  I have always loved church music.  I think this CD is the best church music I have ever heard.  I have been listening to the music since I was a teenager.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I am a big fan of The Choir of Joy, and I am glad they are releasing a CD.  It is so important that a community has a local worship band, and I think this group is very great.  I love the Choir of Joy's music.  It is so well written, and I love the way it has

Amazon review: I am a big fan of The Beatles and I love John and Paul. I love this album. However, I think this is the best album by this group with me being a big Beatles fan. The songs are so beautifully written. I love the use of harmony in many of the songs. The band is so good that it makes me feel like I was there when the Beatles were recording the album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.
