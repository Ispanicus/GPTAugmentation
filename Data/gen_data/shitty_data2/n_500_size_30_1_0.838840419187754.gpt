Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

This was one of our favorite Dylan songs! I love it. It's very emotional and powerful. I believe it was released in 1963!
This is a great song. I love the lyrics. It is a very powerful song. It is about the power of love and the pain that many of us will feel when we lose someone we love. The lyrics are very powerful and they make you think about people you love and their pain. If you ever need someone to talk to about the pain you are going through, this is the song for you.

I like the song "If Not for You" because it is a beautiful song that speaks of how much you miss someone and how you wish they were with you. It is a very powerful song and it is one of my favorites. I love the lyrics. I like how the singer sings it. I like the music. I am not a very religious person. However, if it were possible, I would want to be an agnostic or a non-believer. However, in this case, I believe that God loves me. If I was to die, I will probably be with God somewhere.

"If Not for You" is one of my favorite songs!

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.

Amazon review: The album is really good, but when you listen to the CD in the car or on the way to work, it gets old after about 30 minutes.  I agree with the previous reviews, though, that the album is worth the money. I'm not sure if it's a good CD or not.  A few of the tracks are good, but the ones that are bad or just plain boring are so long that I almost can't hear them. The most annoying thing is that one of the tracks is a remix of a song from the album. I don't know if the remix is an original song or not, but it just seems like a mistake to go with a song on the album.  I would recommend it to anyone, especially those who like Bob Dylan.

Customer Reviews (3)

This CD was very disappointing. I've been listening to both The Postal Service and Bob Dylan's Christmas Album. The Postal Service was fantastic except for the fact that they did not have a song that I liked. But Bob Dylan sounded so bland that I had to check out other CDs. This CD was a complete waste of money.

This album is all songs from the film "White Christmas". The song "White Christmas" is the only song that has been improved from the studio recording when it was released. There is no "The Christmas Song" or "Jingle Bells" on this CD. The backing vocals are all very faint. There was some great music in the film, but not much of it here.

I was really disappointed in this CD. I am a Bob Dylan fan. I wanted this CD to be his best. I had it on CD when it was first released and it had a very good, but not the best, sound. If you were a Bob Dylan fan, you would be happy with the CD I brought you. I was really disappointed, because the music is weak. The lyrics are poor. I was really disappointed when I saw the film "White Christmas" and saw the music from that.

I love both The Postal Service and Bob Dylan's Christmas Album. This is the only CD I've ever had that has been better than either of them. When I got the CD one year as a gift, I thought I'd give it to my wife. She loves Bob Dylan. I didn't want to give her the CD with the very weak music and bad lyrics. I thought that was a good choice. The Postal Service was the better choice.

The Postal Service is really good. But this CD really sucks. It's not even an album, it's just an hour and a half of songs about nothing. I wish I had never bought it. I think the CD would be better if they'd re-record the songs from the movie. I'm not a Bob Dylan fan anyway, so it's not like I love the album. It's just a waste of money.

I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking that it would be something in his unique style. I was very disappointed. Bob Dylan's voice, for all his fame, is not very clear.

This is a classic Bob Dylan collection. It has all the material from his best albums. The best songs are "It's All Over Now" and "White Christmas." The album was recorded at the end of a very hot day in July. You can hear the cool air coming in the studio. The vocals are good,

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!

Amazon review: While the sound quality is good for the price, the song's message is lost.  The message of the song is pretty simple.  No matter how hard one tries to succeed in life, failure is a certainty.  It is not so much a question of how hard one tries to succeed in life, but rather one's attitude toward life.  I guess these days, that message is lost.  The music is not only good, it is outstanding.  You just have to hear it in order to understand the message.  This song is a real gem.  It stands out for the quality of its sound, and the message it conveys.

Amazon review: This song is about a man who doesn't know how to live.  He is trying to live his life, but he is failing miserably.  The song is sung by Chris de Burgh, who is a very talented singer.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

The song "Foolin'" is the only song on the CD where the guitar riffs are as good as the blues.  I would really like to hear more songs like that.  And of course, I would like to hear more from the other players, but this is a CD with an excellent backing band.  I have to give it up to them.

Amazon review: Well, this is only my opinion, and it may be biased one way or the other.  This is not my first experience with the blues.  I am a big fan of the blues.  I love the music.  I love the singing.  And I love the playing.  But I am not a huge fan of the guitar playing.  So, I listened to blues CD's and books.  And I have to say, I have come to realize that there is a lot more to the blues than the guitar.  I have not studied the music for a long time.  I have only listened to a few CDs.  But what I have learned is that many of the blues artists that I have listened to are not just guitar players.  They are singers and they have singers that play the harmonica, the fiddle, and other various instruments.  And some of them have also played the bass, the drums, the harmonica, and various other instruments.  And some of them play all of the instruments.  And some of them are all in one band.  All of them. The blues is not just the guitar.  It is not just the harmonica.  It is not just the fiddle.  It is not just the bass.  It is more than that.  It is a lot of different things.  And I am sure that I have not listened to all of the blues because I am not all that interested in all of the blues.  I enjoy many of the blues and I am sure I have not listened to all of them.  But I have listened to a couple of them.  And I have to say that I have come to realize that I really like the blues, but what I do not like is the guitar that is used in many of the blues.  I have come to realize that I really like the blues, but what is the guitar that people play in the blues?  It is not the guitar that I like.  But I am not a fan of the blues that much.  I am a big fan of the blues, but I have to say that there is a lot more to the blues than the guitar.  And I am sure that I have not listened to all of them because I am not all that interested in all of them.  I enjoy many of the blues and I am sure that I have not listened to all of them.  But I have listened too many blues to count.  But I have come to realize that what I like is the blues, but what I do not like is the guitar that is played in the blues.  I am not going to list out the blues that I have listened too.  I will list out the blues that I have not listened too.  And if you are a blues fan, these are the blues that you would like to listen to.  But if you are not a fan of the blues, then these are the blues that you would like to listen to.

I've been listening to this album a lot, and I think it's not just me, everyone who has heard it loves it, it's a fantastic album. It's not perfect, and I know it's not perfect, but I think it's great, so what did I do this time?
I listened to "Hate You", "I'm a Loser" and "I'm a Loser".

It's really beautiful stuff and I'm really glad that I found it.

It's a really good album, and I think you should listen to it.

I think it's the best that we have on here...

Thanks for reading this, I'll see you soon.

Great album, great songs. I really like the songs, but I do have to disagree with you about the album as a whole. I like the songs more than the whole album. I love the flow of the album as a whole. I like the songs that are stand out, but it seems like one of the best albums I've listened to this year.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for a good dance.  And the first two weeks after I got the album in, I started to listen to it more and more.  I like the album and I like the dancing.  I don't care for the first two tracks.  I think there are too many words and "sounds" in the lyrics.  I wish they would have just been more songs.  This album is definitely for the more mature person

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album since I was a kid.  It's one of my favorites.  I love the first song the most.  I would have to say I like the other songs on the album better than the first two.  I'm not a big fan of the lyrics though.  If you are a fan of rap then you should like this album, if not then it's not worth it.  I'm sure there are a lot of people who think it's a great album, but I personally don't.  The opening "songs" are very repetitive and the lyrics are just plain repetitive, it's just a very boring album.  I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not a great album from one of the best.

Amazon review: One of my favorite Dylan albums. A masterpiece!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I love the music of the Stones, but I do not think the band's music has ever really "stood out" to me.  You could say that, but I think it is safe to say that what really makes the Stones' music stand out is the production and the passion that is in the vocals of the Stones.  However, if you are looking to try a different kind of Stones music, I would recommend putting down your money and pick up this CD.  It is not a typical Stones album.  It is a great band that is on the road and playing the road.  With all the great songs on this CD, it is hard to choose one.  However, I will say that this is definately a Stones CD that I will purchase again and again and again.

Amazon review: I am a Stones fan to the core.  I grew up listening to the Stones and was a huge fan of The Stones until I got my first copy of their debut album.  I remember being astounded when I first heard the album and then I got into it.  My friends and I were playing games and would get so bored at the same time that we would just stop playing the game to listen to the Stones.  I could tell that they were having a great time.  I got hooked on the band and have been in love with them ever since.

If you are a Stones fan or a fan of the Stones music in general you should really pick this CD up.

Amazon review: The Stones are one of the most popular bands in rock history.  I have seen them play at least a half a dozen times, on both the road and in concert.  They have always been my favorite band.  When I first got a copy of the Stones debut album I was in awe.  The first song on the album "Satisfaction" was so amazing that I kept playing it and didn't stop until the album was over.  I had to record it.  The recording of "Satisfaction" is amazing and I have been listening to that song for years.  It is a long time that I have been listening to the Stones songs and the Stones albums that I have been listening to.  I think that the Stones will be around for a long time to come.

Amazon review: The band has had a great and lasting impact on rock music.  This band is an example of how bands can have impact on popular music.  They make songs that are so good that they have made people take notice and want to hear more of the band and all the songs that they have created.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I don't know if I can actually call this album good. There is a new synth on there and the production is very clean. But the lyrics are really weak and they are not in sync any more. There are some very weak songs on there but there is good stuff in there. I have to say that I never really could decide what to listen to more at the beginning - the music and the lyrics, or the vocals.

I bought this album, it was very well packaged and had lots of extras like a CD with the lyrics and a CD with all the songs, a CD with the cover art, a CD with a list of the songs, a CD with a list of the instrumentals and a CD with liner notes. The package was very nice. I also got a bonus CD with the cover art and the lyrics.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

This album will probably get you to like Korn. I know I did, and I know a lot of fans do. Korn are one of my favorite bands. I bought it for my sister, but I am pretty sure any one who listens to this album will probably like it a lot. I think it has a lot of great songs, and some really great songs.

I really like this album, and I can't think of anything bad to say about it. It's a decent album. I wouldn't say it's the best album, but it's definitely the best Korn album, and I feel like the last three albums have been better. I still have at least one more album to listen to, though, and I'm going to listen to it some more before I write a review.

Overall, I would say that this album is very good, but it's definitely not the best Korn album. If you like Korn, that's a good album. If you don't, you probably won't like this album. I would say that if you like Korn you may like this album, but I don't think I can say that with 100% certainty. I would say this album gets a 4.5, but since I haven't listened to it in a long time I can't say for sure.

I know this album is good, but I don't know if it's the best Korn album to listen to.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: "The Look of Love" by Cher (from the album "The Very Best of Cher") was released as a single on October 16, 2005 and was the only song from the album to chart in the U.S. "The Look of Love" is a heartfelt, emotional ballad that is sure to touch and move a woman on any level.

Cher has not released in a while, so I thought I would post the songs she has been singing in the last month. Her voice is in top form as usual. I'm surprised, but not disappointed, that her songs are not included in the original compilation, as I think they would have been a great soundtrack.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)

You provide a sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the correct song. unfortunately it's not a lot of the song you're suggesting. I was listening to the song on shuffle, but the sample that you provide only had 1/3rd of the song, and it's not enough to make a judgement.
