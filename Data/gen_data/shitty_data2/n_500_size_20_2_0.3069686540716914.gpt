Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

A little boring at times, but it's a good CD when you're just bored.  I've heard a lot of good rap albums lately, so I was kind of bummed to hear a mediocre album.  But that's the only way to describe it, so I'll keep listening.  I don't know if it was the CD, or the rap artist.

Amazon review: I was disappointed in this CD.  I had been looking forward to it all week because of the good reviews I had read.  I was kind of hoping it would be something original, because most of the time, rap (especially when it's a "gangsta" rapper, like the "Ladies"-style) tends to be boring.  This CD didn't satisfy me.  The album just wasn't "hip-hop" enough for me.  I know this is kind of a boring review, but it was the best album I've listened to this past week, so it was a waste of money.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon book review: This book is a collection of holiday themed songs, which is excellent!  The only downside is that it is quite a lengthy book, it's a best seller in the USA and is even in the top ten of the UK.  The book has around 60 songs, all of which are good, but I personally like the ones that are very, very old and have Christmas themes.  The only ones I do not like are the ones with a jingle jangle feel, and I do not like the Christmas songs that have a Christmas feel but have a different song underneath the jingle jangle feel.  There are some that are good but not a lot of fun.  Overall I enjoyed it.

Amazon review: I love Billy Joel, but I don't like this song.   I'm not sold on his voice, so I can't see it being one of his top ten.  I liked "Just the Way You Are", but he had some serious problems with it.  I can't see this being his best work.

Amazon review: My fav from the '80s.  I always liked her voice, but not this song.   It's a catchy tune, but I don't care for the lyrics.  It's not her singing style.  I would just as soon have a Billy Joel or a John Denver song.

Amazon reviewer: Billy Joel fans, you are in luck.  His first album in 35 years is available on Amazon, and you can get it for as low as $0.99.  But wait, there's more!  You can also get all the other albums from the '80s on the same price.  That's right!  All the records you've been waiting for!

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been a fan of Regina Spektor for years, and I was very excited when she first started releasing albums on her own label. However, I found that I wasn't very surprised by the music. I mean, it was the kind of music I like, but I think most people would probably find it pretty boring. To me, it was kind of like listening to the same album 10 times in a row. The only reason I kept going back was because I knew she was releasing new music. I just figured, there will be a new song on the other side. I was wrong. She released a new record last Friday and I was completely unprepared for it. I listened to it last night, and I thought, "wow! this is awesome. I think I will probably buy it." I didn't really hear much of it, but I really enjoyed the opening song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I first heard Regina Spektor's music in 2002, when I was in my early 20's. I remember being pretty impressed with the song "The Good Life". I remember feeling like this was something I had wanted to hear all my life. I don't know if that's the case, but the song was very good. I thought it was a great song and I haven't heard anything else from her since that time. I know that the new album is going to blow me away, but in all honesty, I can't really enjoy it because I just don't like her music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a lot of respect for Regina Spektor. I've bought all her music, and I've even bought her CDs in the mail. I've heard them all. She has a very good voice, and she is very unique. She is a great singer, and she really knows how to get the best out of her voice. Her new album is phenomenal. I don't know how I'm going to have the time to listen to it all, but I will definitely be buying it and listening to it. I don't have any plans to listen to it over and over again, but I'll definitely be listening to it again. I don't know how I feel about it, but I will definitely be buying it. This is definitely going to be one of my favorite albums from this year.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Regina Specktor since I first heard her song "The Good Life" on the radio. I heard the song over and over again, and I never really heard why I liked it so much. I remember being completely disappointed when I first heard the song, and I kept having it in my head. Then I heard "The Last Goodbye", and I thought, "that's a good song," and the rest of the album just confirmed that to me. I really like the songs on this album. They are very catchy, and there are some good songs on the album. I really like them. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Regina Specktor.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge Regina Spektor fan. I've bought all of her CDs, and I have them all in my car. I love her song "The Good Life" as well as "The Last Goodbye" and "Hollow" amongst others. I have a lot of respect for her, and I really love her music. I heard the new album "Wildflower", and I was blown away by it. I was really impressed with it. I have listened to it over and over again, but I don't really like it, and I think it would have been better if she just kept on releasing newer material. I just don't like her music, so I'm not even gonna talk about it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've really been enjoying Regina Spektor's music since the release of her fifth album "The Great Unknown". I really like her music, and I've been buying all of her CD's since then.

I don't have any plans to listen to it over and again, but I will definitely be buying it. I really enjoy her music, so I really don't have any plans to play it over and over again. I can't really tell if this is good or not, but I will definitely be buying it and listening to it over and over again. I like her music, so I'm definitely going to be buying this album.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I purchased this music box for my mother. She has never been a fan of Christmas music, but this is the first song she said "I hate Christmas music!" She's a non-believer. That's okay.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a non-believer in Christmas.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: This was a new release on Amazon.  I am not a fan of this band, but it was a good album.  I did like the song, "I'm Back".  But the rest of the album was a mixed bag.  I know the song, "It's Never Been Better", is a classic.  The rest of the songs were not as good.  If you enjoy this type of music, you'll enjoy this project.  I guess you can't please everyone.  But if you have a taste for country music, this album is worth a listen.
