Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor is a talented songwriter.  This CD is amazing.  I was surprised by how good it was. I had a hard time getting through it.  I was really sad when I finished it.  I really liked it, but it is just not my style, and I don't know if it's the CD or me. The songs are very much about the love of a woman.  I just don't love her.  She really needs to find a guy who likes her and is not just interested in her looks.  The songs are about the pain of a relationship.  I just don't like her, and so I can't listen to her songs.  I felt like I was just wasting my time listening to her cd.  The songs were so sad.  I really like the idea of how she is moving on from the relationship. So sad.  But I just don't like her.  I'm just going to get a refund from Amazon.

Amazon review: I didn't feel like I was listening to an artist anymore.  I wasn't even getting a musical experience.  I just didn't like the songs. I didn't like the way she was singing the vocals.  I didn't even feel like I was listening to a real artist.  It just felt like she's just playing the guitar very badly.  I couldn't understand what she was singing, and I could tell she didn't really know how to sing.  I just don't like her at all.  I think she is just trying to make money off other people's work.  I love the music, but I don't like the artist.  I didn't feel like I was listening to an artist anymore.

Amazon review: Meghan is an amazing vocalist and songwriter.  I love her so much.  I just didn't feel like I was listening to an artist anymore.  I actually loved her voice.  I could sing along with every word she sang.  I just didn't feel like I was listening to an artist.  I really like her music, but it just didn't feel like her.  I really liked her song "All the Stars".  I like the idea of a love song, but the lyrics are not very good.  She really needs to find a good guy.  I just didn't feel like I was listening to an artist any longer.

Amazon review: I love this song and love the lyrics. I just didn't like the song, and I didn't feel like I was listening to an artist any longer.

I don't have a CD player in my car, and I don't want to have to leave my CD player in the car with my wife and kids.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

My only complaint is that most of the songs sound alike, and I guess that's a good thing.

Either way, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes The Beatles or even just music in general.

The vocals are very clear and the songs are very well written, with some of the more interesting lyrics. The songs have excellent melodies, and the lyrics are somewhat interesting.  The vocals are what really annoy me.  The vocal harmonies are very clear and they are even better when there is a good bass line.

The vocals are extremely unprofessional, and the songs seem to be composed by a bunch of 8th graders trying to imitate a pop song.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I do not believe that this band even exists anymore, the guy who was the guitarist can't play. I did like their sound, but the writing and singing is just plain boring and I do not believe that anyone really wants to listen to them anymore.  They're like the last 30 seconds of a song that you can only listen to twice, cause you are not really listening, you're just standing there and waiting for the next song to start.  I would not buy this CD.

Amazon review: This CD contains a set of choral works by Libera, they are just terrible.  The sound is nothing special; the music is nothing special.  They are just so boring and generic.

Amazon review: This album contains all of their best songs.  I've loved all of them, and I will love them more because I know they are good.

And this album is only the best of the lot.

Amazon review: My wife was talking about how Libera was a band that would work and she had no idea that I would enjoy their music.  I have to give her credit, she is right, these are great musicians and I am glad that she's my wife.  I want to hear more and more of their music and I am sure that I will.  I did not know that they were such masters in the field of chamber music and I am so glad that I found this CD.  I will buy all of their other CDs and I guarantee you that I will be listening to it constantly for the next few months.  Thank you for a great CD.  I really like it and I believe that you should put more of their music on other CD's and I will buy them.  Thank you.

Amazon review: My wife is a big fan of Libera's and wanted to know if I thought they were any good.  I said yes and she was so impressed with myself, I did not know that she was a fan of Libera's, I think she might be a fan of their music.  I have to give her credit, she is right and I can tell you why.  I like their music but I really like their music more because of the emotion that it has got.  I'm a fan and I just love it so much!  I really like her and I told her that she is right, I really like my wife.  I am very impressed with her and I should have given her credit for what she said.  I can't wait to see what she thinks of their music and I can't wait for her to hear more of their music.  Thank you for making a great CD.

Amazon review: My wife and I heard Libera's choral work on the internet radio, I thought they sounded really good.  After listening to their entire CD, I have to say that they sound like the band that the music business was built upon.    They sound better than the average band.  Their music is beautiful.  They have a great sound.  I would not know why, to buy all of their music, they are so boring.  They are not even close to the musicians that they are.  I have to tell you that I love their music, it is so soothing and so beautiful, it is hard to put it down.  I have to say that I love their music.  I really like it.  I have to tell you that I love their music.  I just love their music and I really like the arrangements.  Their music is beautiful.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: My first cd experience with Revel was on my trip to the  states.  I was introduced to them by a friend and he introduced me to the band, and  he was not the only person.  After I returned from the trip I downloaded 3 of their cd's.  I have been a big fan of  Revel ever since, and have been going to  their concerts ever since, and  I decided to finally get a cd from Revel.  I am very happy I did.  Although my opinion is mixed,  Revel is a great group.  I think the cd's are very good,  the music is catchy and it gets stuck in your head.  I would recommend it for the Christian fan, but for me,  I think it is not a Christian group.  I do not think the music is for Christians,  nor do I recommend it for anyone else,  I am not a Christian,  I am not a believer.  My brother and I have  bought all of their cd's and I have never seen them play a song.  I only bought these cd's on a whim,  I  am not paying to listen to this music, I am buying them because I enjoy the music and the band.  If you are a Christian and want to know what I think about the music, I am a Christian and I am not a believer,  so I can't really speak on their music.  I am going to have to listen to this cd to determine if I could  even be classified as a Christian.  I don't think so,  so I am going to be honest.  The music does not move me or move me to love the Lord.  I do not think it does because it is not about God's name and all that.  I will continue to buy their cd's,  but I will be honest with you, I will not be buying them for the music.  As a musician and as a Christian,  I think the music is good, but I am not a Christian,  so it is not my job to listen to a Christian band for the music.  I am listening to the music because I enjoy the music,  I enjoy the music because I am a Christian,  I enjoy the music because what I like is the music,  not the music because I am a Christian.  I will continue to listen to their cd's,  but I will be honest with you,  I will not be buying them for the music.  The music is good,  the music is not good,  the music is not bad,  the music is good,  but not Christian.  The music is good,  but not Christian.  I am going to continue to listen to their cd's,  but I will be honest,  I will not be buying them for the music.  The song 'Let The Worshipers Arise' is not bad,  it is catchy and I like the lyrics,  but it is not good music for Christians.  The music is good,  the music is not good, and it is not Christian.  The only way I can categorize the music is by the album.  The first album I have listened to is 'The Art Of Rock' and I really like the album,  but the last album I have listened to is 'The Art Of Rock 2',  and I really do not like the album,  I do not like the sound the album presents,  I do not like the sound the album presents to me.  I have not listened to the music from other albums,  I will be honest with you,  the music from other albums is not good,  there are bands that are better than Revel.  So, in my opinion,  the problem with the music is the music from other albums (not Revel),  I will continue to listen to their cd's,  but I am going to be honest with you,  I will not be buying them for the musical ability,  I will not be buying them for the music,  I will not be buying them for the music,  I am buying them because I like the music.  I am not buying them because of the music.  I am buying them because I like the music.  I really do not buy music because of the name and the person who writes the music.  I am buying music because the music is good,  the music is not good,  the music's is not bad,  the music is good,  but it is not Christian.  The only way I can categorize the songs is by

The Schubert family should not be forgotten. They have been working to preserve their legacy for centuries and have been providing music to the world today.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The only thing is that I love the song because I heard it on the radio once and I was like "I have to listen to this song again."  Then I heard the song on the radio and I was like "Oh yeah, this is the song."  I don't know why I am giving you my opinion when I have already heard a song several times.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

The Eagles - Tears of the Sun (7")

Amazon review: This album is a must have for anyone who loves the Eagles. It's not a rock album, but there are some good rock songs on here. It's kind of a "throwback" album, but in a good way.

I am back from my trip to California. I had a great time and I had to get out more. I am not sure if I can say I am back to how I was before I went to California but I am here. I have been here for almost a week and I am pretty much back to normal. This is what I am going to do:

This morning I decided to do something I have never done before: I washed my hair. I have always washed my hair every Saturday and every Sunday but this morning I was feeling lazy and decided to just do it in the morning. I was so surprised by how much I loved it. I didn't realize how much I loved it. I thought I just liked the feeling of being clean and smelling good. I also didn't realize how much I would love to see my hair looking like this. I am pretty sure this is the best job anyone has ever had. It's very relaxing. I have a hard time making the hair look its best and this morning I was able to do it. I have never had so much self confidence in my entire life.

So I am pretty much back to normal. I guess this means I am back to normal. I love you all. Thanks for visiting me. I hope to hear from you again soon.

When reading about the movie "The Good Wife" I was excited that Alicia Florrick would get involved in the movie and it seemed like the story would be so interesting. When watching the movie I was pretty disappointed. The story line seemed way off in my opinion. The story seemed way off. I really don't know what was going on in that movie and I guess I really don't care. I just didn't like it. The character I thought was going to be the stand out character was also the character that had the most screen time. I mean her whole storyline was basically just the background noise. I didn't like her or her character at all. I thought she was boring to me. I thought she was a waste of time.

I really thought this would be a good movie. The storyline was good. The acting was good. The writing is good. The cinematography was good. The music was good. I liked the entire movie. I really liked the characters and I liked the ending. I really liked the ending to my movie. I also liked the entire movie. I just didn't like the character I thought was going to be the stand out character. I thought she was a waste of time. It's a shame because this movie was a good movie. I don't regret watching it at all. I had a great time. I just wish I didn't waste my time with this one.

I was a big fan of the movie "The Karate Kid" and I was excited to see the movie "The Karate Kid". I was disappointed when I watched the movie and I was disappointed with the movie. I don't remember anything from the movie. I don't remember anything about the plot. I don't remember the characters. I don't remember anything about the acting. I don't remember the dialogue. I don't remember anything. The only thing I do remember is, "I know he's karate". I remember the entire movie. I thought this would be a good movie. The storyline was good. The actors were good.

Amazon review: This album doesn't deserve to be called an album.  It's just two albums of crap.  The first cd is pretty good and the second cd sucks.  The songs are ok, but the lyrics are just terrible.  This is the exact same song over and over again.  It is a waste of time and money.

Amazon review: This is definately a waste of time and space.  I hate it.  If you really care about hip-hop, go back to the 90's and listen to G-Dep.  This is not a good album.  I wish it would have a "rock" sound and not be so "warped" and sound more "rock" but it's just "filler".  Not a fan.  I will not buy any of this album.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  It's just a bunch of filler songs.  It's so boring and I don't care what anyone says it's just a bunch of filler songs.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

This is not one of the CDs that I have listened to. I think I will have to buy this one just to listen to Macbeth again and to be able to say that I have not lied to you. Thank you for listening and I hope that you will give this a listen

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Many of the songs he sings are truly breathtaking as he infuses them with a sense of joy and hope.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: From the very first song by this band, I was hooked.  This is the band's only CD on Amazon.  I have never had a problem with their music.  I bought their CD  a couple of weeks ago; and I am not happy with it.  I don't see why, since I would have given this CD to my mother, sister, and friends.  I feel that the band is on their way down, and this is the final nail in the coffin.  I don't know if I will buy this CD again.  I will only buy from Amazon if I can get a refund.

Amazon review: All the songs are good, and the whole band is pretty nice.  I haven't heard any of their songs on other CDs, so I really don't know how these guys play.  I have been to a few concerts while I lived in San Diego, and they were pretty good as far as the band goes.  I had a bad experience with them in San Diego, and I have always thought that they should be more professional about their music.  I could be wrong, but I still think that they are more professional than they are.  I have always liked the sound they make.  Their sound is a little more "clean" than the sound of many of the other bands I listen to.  Also, I don't think they ever play the same song twice.  They change the song every night.  You can't do that if you are going to play the same song a few nights in a row.  I wouldn't know.  I don't know if this album has anything over the other CDs I have.  But I am glad I bought it, because it is a very good CD.

Amazon review: I was a regular listener of the "Beach Party" radio show on KRLD in San Diego.  They were great!  I liked their music.  One song caught my ear, and I decided I wanted to download it.  It was called "The Dream".  I had heard that song before, and I had heard it as a demo CD.  I looked it up and found that it was a different song.  I thought I had heard it before, but I had not.  I downloaded it and I was very happy with the song.  When I found that it was a different song, I decided that I had to buy it.  I was very happy with the song, but I was surprised at the price.  It came for $9.95.  I felt that it was a good price, but I thought it was too expensive.  Now, I know it was not too expensive.  There was no printing on the cover.  I didn't have to pay for shipping.  I was happy.  I was happy because I have been playing the song over and over on my CD drive.  It has now got to that point where I don't want to hear it anymore.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe it is the CD, or maybe it is me.  I don't know.  I don't know how I can have had a good experience with it.  I just don't know.  I wish I had not bought it.  I know that it will be in my CD player for a long time to come.

Amazon review: I have heard of this band when I lived in Michigan.  I was not so impressed.  The first song is ok.  I like the sound of it.  I like the fact that it is a lot of different songs.  It is not the same band that is on the CD.  I bought the CD, but it is a different band.  The band sounds like they will lose some of their  sound as time goes on.  I don't know what happened.  I will not buy another CD or CD-R from this band.  I have had to go to my mother and ask to have the CD returned.  I don't want to play this CD on my car radio again.  I have had to go to my mother and ask for the CD to be returned.  I don't want to listen to this song again.  That is the only reason I am writing this review.  The band is not original and original is not good.  This band should play original songs.  They are going out of style.  If this band played original songs, they would be very good.  At least I will give them that.  I will not buy this CD or CD-R again.

What's your opinion?

This is a great album, but I can't get used to it.

I did not like it.

My opinion

I just want to say the best thing I've ever heard. I thought it was a waste of money. I did buy the original (also with 20 bucks) but I have already bought the deluxe cd, so I guess I'll just have to wait for the deluxe cd which I will never buy. I've found the original cd is much better.

I love this man. He is the real deal, his voice is amazing, he has such a beautiful voice, and he is just a great guy. I've been listening to him for over 30 years now. He has a way of getting you into a certain mood every time. Also, he is like a father figure to me. I know hes not a father figure in real life, but hes a good friend who I've always loved, and I'm glad I've been able to meet and know him.

I just bought his album after I got my copy of "The Lion King" and I was totally blown away by this. His voice is just so authentic and not fake at all. He has really good lyrical skill, and the songs really flow and flow and flow, and he is just a great singer.

Also, the album is so much better in quality on the CD than the DVD. The CD is definitely worth more money. I bought the dvd, but I never liked it. The quality of the dvd is very poor.

This album is sooooooo worth it. I bought it last year and I loved it. The quality on the cd is good. The songs are all very different from one another. I have never listened to this album with others. It is very different to listen to alone.

I bought this cd in July and I am still playing it every day. I think the album is great. I just wish I had it on CD. This album is worth more than the money I spent on the cd. I love it!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
