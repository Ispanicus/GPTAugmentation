Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is the band's most recent album, and it is so different from their previous work that I find it hard to believe that Tuxedo Junction is the same band that I've heard in the past couple of years. I'm also glad that this album is just as good with songs like, "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown in 3/4" and "Team Black Soma One Armed Man".  This is also the first release outside of their original lineup since the group broke up.  Their first two releases were recorded with different musicians, but this album has an all out Tuxedo Junction sound.  I wish I had more positive things to say about this album, but I can't help but feel that it is just another boring, uninspired album that is good because of the cover art.  The music itself is not bad, but the lyrics are just plain boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have had this album for over a year now, and have never had a really positive review until now.  The first song that I heard was "The Spy Hunter Safe Haven Breakdown In 3/4", and I could not get it out of my head.  I love the song, and I love the fact that the members of this group are still alive.  I have been a fan of the band since their debut album, and this is the best album they have put out, and I'm happy to say that I'm a happy fan as well.  This album is excellent.  The group has a very unique sound that they do not attempt to copy.  The music is a very hard rock sound, and the best part about this album is that the group is still alive.  The songs are short and to the point, and the lyrics are very clear.  This album is a must have for any fan of hard rock music.

Amazon review: This is my favorite Tuxedo Junction album.  I got it on a special bargain.  I love their music and I love the fact that they have a new song every year.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: The song is great but I just don't think I would have enjoyed the song.  The lyrics are a little childish.  And Bob Johnson doesn't know if he is supposed to be singing about a man that he is in love with or if he is in love with the man that he is supposed to be singing about.

Amazon review: this song is one of my favorites, but the lyrics are boring.  I like the song but it could have been much better.  I really like this song. I wish he would have found somebody to sing it with, but he didn't.  I don't think this is good for a teenager to listen to.  It's corny and it's not very good.  I'm glad I bought it.  I did enjoy it, but I think it could have been better.

Amazon review for Bob Johnson "The Man That Broke My Heart" :

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is a different sound than the other bands I have played with. It has something that is nice to the ears but the bass is a little "squeaky" and the drums are a little "slapdash". I have gotten a couple of compliments on this album. I have played with some great players and I believe that this is one of the best. I have been playing with my best friend for the past several years. I have played with many good musicians through the years. This is a great cd to play with another best friend. This is a great cd to play with someone special. I am not the top ear for music and have always had to listen to the cd. I just listen to the cd and play the music.

Amazon review: I know this band for several years. I have seen them numerous times. Their CDs are always in good shape. I have heard many people refer to this band as "classical" but I don't think that is the correct name. I think they are more like a cross between rock and roll and western classical. They are known for playing a lot of good music and are always looking for new and exciting material to play. I have not played with them in a long time, but hope to get back into the swing of things.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Ray Benson for several years now.  I bought this cd the first time it was available in my area.  I was impressed with Ray's playing, his ability to write his own songs and his ability to play in a variety of styles.  I listened to Ray's band often; I even purchased his solo albums when he had them.  I have to say that this cd is the best Ray Benson cd  I have yet to hear. The music is very enjoyable. The album is very long, but it is not over the top. The songs are very well written and have a lot of emotion to them. There are a few ballads, but the song selection is very good.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why people have been complaining about this album.  I loved it,  and I've been a fan since it came out in 2000.  Just because he's a rapper doesn't mean you have to listen to his lyrics.  I'm sure some of his lyrics are very immature and crude, but that doesn't mean they're not his personal opinion or something that he would say.  This album has his most mature lyrics, and some very strong opinions that are not typical for rap music.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I like the fact that he doesn't put on airs, he actually lives by them. I like the fact that he doesn't put on airs, his parents are not on his payroll. I like the fact that he is not a paid shill and does not use this blog to make money.  The fact that he is a musicologist and a psychologist shows that he is not a paid shill.  His opinions are his personal opinions and as such, should not be taken as fact.  I like the fact that he does not use this blog to make money.  I like the fact that he is not a paid shill and does NOT use this blog to make money. I like the fact that he does not use this blog to make money, and yet he has managed to get a job at a music store.  I like the fact that he does not use this blog to get a job, and yet he has managed to get a job at a music store and is making a decent salary.  I like the fact that he does not use this blog to promote his music and has yet to be paid to do so.  He is doing it for free, for his personal enjoyment, and because he wants to share his opinions with all of us.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Lin Manuel's music is amazing.  I have been a fan of his music since I was in high school.  I went to Lin Manuel's concert in December of 1998.  I was in love.  At the concert, I was sitting in the front row.  I was right up front and when the concert was over I stood up to go to the restroom and I noticed Lin was sitting right behind me.  He came and sat with me, and I could not believe my luck.  He started to talk to me and I did not say anything.  He just sat there and talked.  I talked to him the next day and we finally made plans to meet in the summer and tour together.  After a couple of months, I went to Seattle and met him.  He was very nice and he took me on a tour of his school and his church and he invited me to live with him in Florida in the summer and I did.  I was very excited and I was going to move there.  I was going to move in with Lin and he was nice about it.  We made plans to tour together and we finally did.  I flew to Florida in May of 1999 and moved in with Lin in July.  I was very excited to finally be with Lin.  We toured together and went out to dinner a few times.  I loved it.  It was great.  I am so glad I did it.  I met Lin and I fell in love with him.  He is a wonderful and gifted person and I have been very blessed to have this chance to know him.  He is a great guy.  I love him and he loves me.  He is a great person.  He is a very talented musician, a great writer, a great guy, and I love him.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know if I like this version of the album by much.  Bob Johnson sounds the same and he has the same kind of voice as most of the Bluesmen and Blues singers that I have heard.  I don't see what makes this version so special.  The only thing is that they could have put any Bluesman, singer or band out of this album.  That would have been ok.  But the only difference between this version of AI and all the others is that Bob Johnson took a year off.  So why can't they just leave him alone?  I guess they don't want to give him a chance to show what he can do.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Great audio quality.  I have listened to this version of AI on my computer and on my MP3 player (it's a great player and I love it).  I would prefer to have the song put on a CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: I was so surprised at how well it sang in my car.  I have a lot of trouble singing out loud in a car.  I was really impressed.  I would recommend this CD to anyone and they would get it and love it.    I just wish the lyrics would be written in more of a conversational style, so that it could be sung along with the music.  And I don't mean singing along with the music, I mean singing along with the chorus of the song.  It's a lot easier to listen to a song and enjoy it when the lyrics are sung in the same style as the music.  This is not a fault of  the CD, but a result of the style of lyrics.  I wish the lyrics were written in a more conversational style.  It would have been easier to relate to the songs.

I would recommend this CD, but I would not buy the deluxe.  The deluxe is a great album, but I think the songs on the CD are not up to par and need to be rerecorded.

The only thing I would change is to sing along with the music, and to get the lyrics in a different style, I think that would be a plus.

Amazon review: I really want to say I love this CD, but I'm afraid I'll sound like an idiot.  I just love the songs and music, and the choir is great.  I just don't understand why there is no chorus on some of the songs, and why it's so repetitious.  I don't mind the repetitiousness, it's just that the lyrics sometimes seem like a repetition to me.  I wish they would just let the chorus come out of the last verse, or the bridge, so we could get the full song.  I would recommend this CD,  I really like it.

It is great to listen to, and I have been enjoying the new version of the CD for some time now, and I have been enjoying it more than ever. The only issue that I have with this album is that the only song I would call a "hit" is the song "The Lord Is My Shepherd." This is probably the best song on the album for me, but for that reason, it's not the best song on the album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Dallas Holm's music is often compared to the works of Frank Sinatra, but I have to say that I never really felt the resemblance. Holm has a clear, strong voice, but his songs are often very emotional.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this album a few times, and I am still impressed with this album. It is my opinion that Dallas Holm's music is a lot more emotionally intense with his songs than most others. This album is a collection of songs that are well written, and have a lot of soul. I have been listening to the album a lot lately and I still find that I am getting emotionally involved with the songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: You've been through a lot in your life and you've been through a lot in this band.  You've gotten rich, you've gotten famous, and you've gotten a reputation for being a great band.

Amazon review: I was a fan of Twiztid when they first came out and thought these songs were great.  The songs that I was not a fan of were: "Kissin' Cousins" and "Maggot Brain."  They are both really good songs.  I don't like the way that the vocals are done.

Amazon review: I was really surprised when I saw the CD.  It was kind of like I had never had a negative impression of Twiztid before. I thought it was a great album but it just didn't stand out.  I think that the music on the new album will be really good and I think that it will be one of the best albums of this year.  The songs are catchy and have a great flow to them.  I really like the new lyrics.  I think that the new songs have a very positive tone to them.  I think that this is going to be a really good album and that I will be buying it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think Twiztid is one of the greatest bands to ever come out of America.  They were always different and always unique.  They were the first band that stood out from the rest and brought a new level of energy and excitement to their music.  They're one of the few bands to make money off the hard work of their members and they did it the way they wanted to do it.  I will be buying their new CD, which is almost here.

Amazon review: I started listening to Twiztid before I could read music.  I liked the first album (I was really late to the Twiztid party)and the second, but I really liked the third album.  This one is good, but I was disappointed that this album had more of the same songs than the two previous ones, but I did like the sound of the new ones.  I also like the new lyrics, which remind me more of a classic rock band than the punk rock band that Twiztid was at first.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

I would recommend this album to anyone who loves music and is looking for something more interesting to listen to.

Amazon review: My father has been listening to Bob and the band for about 30 years now.  He always had a real appreciation for the music that he grew up with but was always a little afraid of what they would do with it.  This album is a real show stopper for him.  It just speaks to him, the heartbreak, the sadness, the love.  After listening to this album I can see why.  No matter what I tell him, he will listen to it and play it and make sure I know that I am in the presence of something special.

I am not sure how I can even express how much I enjoy listening to this band and the songs that they have written.  I have always loved their music and have always wished to hear them in concert.  I hope that this is not an indication of what's to come, but I do know that I will still listen to this album and will continue to buy the band's CDs and watch for their shows.  I hope that I can go to one.

Amazon review: Well, I am just so damn proud of this, I did not get a chance to sit down and really listen to it, I only got a chance to listen to one song, and it was good.  I think I am going to buy the CD, even though it's not mine to buy, I know that I am going to be a loyal fan of the artist.  I am not sure if this is going to be the big surprise or not, but it certainly is worth the money.

Amazon review: I can't believe I didn't know about this until now, but after I saw the music video for this I thought it was an amazing rendition of a song I never saw before.  I was wondering why the song wasn't on the CD.  This is a great album and I am definitely going to have to buy it.

Amazon review: I love this album for it's very personal lyrics, but it's also very well produced.  The songs are not long, and the album is very easy to put on your stereo.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

If you are looking for a great musical soundtrack to a movie then look no further!

It's Christmas time, and I have something special for everyone. It's a little gift for all you ladies out there.

This year was a big year for me, as my girlfriend and I got married. I have been on and off since I was 10 years old. I've been in the Navy for 14 years, then I moved back to the city and got a job at a record company. I have always wanted to be in the music industry, but never thought it was for me. One day, I was listening to the radio, and I heard this song on the radio. I was like, "wow, that's the song I've been looking for!" I bought the CD on iTunes, and it was exactly what I had been looking for.

I recorded a demo and sent it to my manager at work, and he listened to it and told me to send him the tape. He was like, "wow, I really like this." I thought he was crazy, but he was right. When I got home from work, I played the demo on my computer, and it was exactly how I wanted it. I called my manager, and I told him to go and listen to this demo. He listened to it, and he told me he loved it. I was like, you should be on the radio!! I was like, "what do you mean?" He said, "listen to this demo." I was like, "I've never heard of this demo. I've never heard of you before. What's going on?" He said, "listen to this demo, and then go listen to this demo at the radio station!" I was like, "I don't know what you are talking about." He said, "listen to this demo, and then go listen at the radio station." I was like, "I don't know how this happened, you are crazy man." His manager was like, "listen to this demo, and then go listen to this at the radio station." I was like, "are you crazy, where is this supposed to happen?" He was like, "listen to this demo, and then go listen at the...

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I liked the first couple songs,  there were a few little things that made me go back to the beginning and listen to the CD twice to really get 'them' out of my system.

I give this CD a 7.5 because it's good,  but I think there are some more of their songs that could be 'lacking.'

There is one song called "Behold the Day"  which is about Jesus' coming back to earth and how wonderful it is to be able to praise Him and worship Him.  There are also 2 songs called "Let the Worshipers Arise" and "Let The Worshippers Arise".  I do understand people wanting to praise God but the lyrics of those songs are not good.  They are not encouraging.  I gave the album a 2 because it is good but I don't think I will listen to the entire album.
