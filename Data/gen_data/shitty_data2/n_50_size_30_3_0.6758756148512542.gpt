Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was excited to get this album and it has not disappointed.  The songs are all very good.  The only problem I have is the songs on the first half of the album are much more impressive than the songs on the second half of the album.  It seems that on the first half of the album they are trying to out do the first half on the second half and it only makes the first half seem better.  Some of the songs are better than others.  I have to say the songs on the first half of the album are just as good as the songs on the second half of the album.  But overall I would recommend getting this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is really disappointing.  Some songs are enjoyable, but most of them are terrible.  There isn't a great deal of diversity in the sound of this album.  The artists are all over the place.  You hear the same artists over and over again.  There are no great songs here.  The only songs I can come up with are "Gangsta Boo" and "Ding Dong!"  There are a few other songs that I could have had if I had been paying attention.  This is the worst I have heard so far from this group.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  The sound is great and the songs are very good.  The only thing that I did not like was Twiztid's vocals.  The vocals on the song "New York" were bad but not that bad.  I thought I could hear the vocal mistakes, but after listening back to the recording, I realized that it didn't sound that bad.  I really liked the song "The Manic" because it was very catchy and fun to listen to.  The last two songs on the album are good and it would be nice if they had more songs like that.  It's a good album.  Give it a try.

Amazon review: This album by the New York based group is great and fun to listen to.  There are some really good songs on this album but the one song that I really liked was the song "Mama's Boy" and I would recommend to listen to it while you are listening to this album.  The other two songs that I liked on this album are "The Manic" and "New York".  They are very catchy and fun to listen to and I would recommend to listen to them while you are listening to this album.  The rest of the songs on this album are not as good as the songs on the first half of the album but they are still good.  Overall I would recommend this album to anybody.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: This CD from the 80's has some brilliant stuff on it, like "Candy Shop" (if you like 60's R&B), and "She" (good ballad).  It is from the album "Majors", which has some great stuff from the 60's and 70's.  The only real problem I had with the album was, the CD has a big hole that you have to put your ear towards the music to hear the track.  A lot of the tracks are just not very loud, which makes it hard to get them out of your head.  Other than that, i have no problems with the CD.  I would have given it a 5 stars, but I was just disappointed with it.  I still like the CD, but i will not be buying any more of their CDs.

Amazon review: This song is from a CD by the band "The J.B.'s".  The J.B.'s is a very talented group that has been on the scene for quite awhile.  I have been listening to their music ever since their debut CD, and I have never been disappointed.  Most of their songs (like "Dance for Me") have a great beat, and a lot of the songs are very fast.  I have not heard the song that I am looking for, but I have heard several of the songs, and I like them all. "The J.B.'s" is one of the best bands to come out of the 70's.  They are on my iPod at all times, and I do not have to turn it off.  I will most likely buy a CD from this group soon.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

I asked to speak to a manager and he said that they did not sell CDs anymore. I asked him how I could get a hold of the CD. He told me that the store had left for the day. He said he would call me back in the morning. No call. It was quite a while before he called me back. I went to the store and found the CD there. I went to the website and had a look around. The CD wasn't there either. So I called the store and got my manager's name and number. I called him and told him what happened and he told me to come on in the morning. He tried calling me back, but it was not working. He called and left a message. He told me to call him back in the morning if I wasn't going to come in the morning. I called him back at 8:30 in the morning and he was ready for me. We left a message and talked for quite awhile. He said that he was going to get in contact with the CD manufacturer and get the CD in. Well, I told him that I wanted to wait until I talked to the CD manufacturer in the morning and that I would buy the CD in the store if they wouldn't have a CD in by the time I got there.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Feds to auction Detroit Tigers' top-winning bid - Detroit News

Back in 1997, an anonymous benefactor paid for a new home to be built in the heart of the city for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Now that home belongs to a former DSO employee who wants to open a new orchestra concert hall.

John Kondracki, the former DSO concertmaster and the man who paid for the home, says he has decided to sell the property to the city of Detroit.

Kondracki first announced his plans to donate $1 million to the city in July. He told the Detroit News that the money would be used to build a new downtown concert hall for both the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and the Detroit Opera Company.

The former concertmaster says he has worked for the DSO since 1990. Kondracki says he has served as the DSO's concertmaster since 1997.

He says he has been instrumental in bringing classical music to the city.

"There's a lot of classical music that could be performed in the city of Detroit that could be played for a profit, that could have very large venues," he said. "And the DSO is the best organization for doing that."

Kondracki says he will donate $250,000 to the Detroit Opera Company to help with a new building.

He says he has been working on the new hall for the past two years. The new building will be called the Detroit Symphony Hall.

Kondracki says he wants to remain anonymous, but he plans on using the proceeds from the sale to fund the new building.

Kondracki says he has no financial stake in the new hall. He says he has a significant financial stake in the DSO.

The DSO has been under financial stress for years. The last concertmaster for the orchestra was retired a few years ago.

Kondracki is also a former

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Wow.  I was scared that this would be a dud.  The guy from  The Devil Wears Prada and the guy from the song "I'll Do Anything" on the same CD.  However,  this CD blew my socks off.  It is great music that has been captured in an amazing way.  It's all about the vibe of the music and the vocals are fantastic.  The lyrics are more of a personal story about each song and not just a joke.  It's a real treat to hear the album and I'm so glad I bought it.

Amazon review: I saw this band live for my birthday a few years ago.  I was a little bit scared at first because I thought the band was too loud.  When I went to the bathroom, I could still hear the band.  I was really surprised by the amount of energy and the way the band was performing live.  They have a very unique sound which is really cool to hear.  I'm glad I bought this CD.  I really like it.

Amazon review: No words!  This band is what I have been looking for.  They are on the same level as the other side.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The lyrics are very nice, but I find that I do not connect with them.  They are not meaningful to me.  I am not a Christian and I really don't feel like it is a song that I would listen to in church.  It is just a simple song with a great beat to it.

He is very wealthy and successful.  He seems to be happy with the way his life is going.  But the one thing that he cannot control is that he has a very jealous wife.  The wife has always been a jealous woman, but since that night she has felt the need to compete with him.  She tells him that he is not good enough to be in her life.  Now she is ready to take him for what he is worth.  She has been his dream woman since she was a kid.  She has been with him for 30 years, and she still wants more.  She tells him that he is no good and that he is not worth it.  This man is very successful, very rich, and he is married to a woman that he can't compete with.  She tells him that he will never get the happiness that he is looking for.  But his wife just wants more.  And she is going to take him back to the place where he lost all her love.  I know the lyrics, but I still can't understand the meaning.  Is she trying to tell him to sell his soul.  I really don't want to know what she is trying to say.  But maybe she is trying to tell him that he is no good.  But I don't know what she is trying to say. I just don't understand the lyrics.  Is she trying to say that he is not worthy?  I don't know.
