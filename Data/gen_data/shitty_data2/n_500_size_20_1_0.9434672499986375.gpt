Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the bands, Love and Rockets, and their song "Love" has always been one of my favorites.  I would recommend this album to anyone that loves a good rock band.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was not sure what to expect from this album.  I thought it would be more of the same.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I found this album to be different than Killers.  There are a whole range of different songs on this album.  The songs that I like the best are on the last 2 tracks.  Some of the others sound like Killers.  I was expecting more of the same.  I like the production on this album. I wish I could have heard the entire album.  The only problem with this album is that I am not too keen on the way they played certain instruments at certain times.  They played the "guitar" a lot in the beginning.  It sounded a little strange.  I thought I was going to hear a bunch of different instruments.  However, I did hear all of them.  I thought it would be a little more different.  I could not get over the fact that the guitar was not played.  I could not understand why they played it at the beginning.  They did it a lot in the end.  It was even worse at the beginning.  They had the guitar there way before they played it.  They had the guitar there way more than they played it during the song.  I do like the way they played the drums at the beginning.  I thought the drums sounded different at first.  Then I realized it was the same drummer playing.  Then they had a different drummer play it at the end.  I like the way they played the drums at the beginning.  Then again, I thought they were playing different drums at the end.  They were playing the same drums at different times.  I am not sure what I feel about that.  I was not expecting the drums to sound as bad as they did.  I thought it would be one of the better songs on the album, but I am no longer sure.  There are only so many times you can hear a drummer not play the drums.  I am not looking for a whole album full of Killers songs.  I am not looking for that.  I am just looking for a couple of the songs that I liked on the last 1/4th of the album to be played.  They did that on the last 1/4th of the album.  I liked the way they played the drums on the 2nd half of the album.  I like the way they played the drums at the beginning. I thought it would be a little different at the beginning.  They played the drums a lot, even though they had many different drummers play it.  I thought they would play the drums a lot more, but they did not.  I thought they would play the drums differently.  I thought they would play the drums a little more.  I thought they would play the drums a little less.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

This album is awesome. It's like a mix of pop and rock, but not in that way. It's pop rock, but it goes all the way down to the lowest octaves. It's quite enjoyable, and I'm sure a lot of people who heard it would agree with me.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: This CD is a treasure for classical music fans.  The CDs are well made, with a clean quality that shows great care and attention to detail.  The packaging is good, in a nice looking cardboard box.  The liner notes are in a booklet that is in the CD case.  The discs themselves are in a nice looking jewel case, and there is a clear plastic shrink wrap on the CD case and back of the jewel case.  This is a nice CD.  The only complaint is that there is no information on the back of the CD case.  It is a very good CD.  I would buy more.  It is a good seller.  Buy from Amazon!  I would buy again.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD from Amazon as I wanted to review it for my own personal collection.  Good CD for a good price.  I only wish the tracks were longer.  The tracks are a good size.  The only thing with the CD is the tracks are a bit short.  The CD plays fine.  The only complain I have is about the tracks I have not heard before.  I would buy it again.  You will not be disappointed.

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon.com: I am a fan of Keith Sweat and have been for quite some time, but I've been very disappointed in this collection. There's nothing special about it. There are some really excellent tracks, but the overall impression is that this is just another collection of Keith Sweat songs.

Amazon.com: I have been a fan of Keith Sweat since I was in high school. I've seen him perform at least a hundred times over the years. However, this CD is not the Keith Sweat for me because it's not the "Keith Sweat" I remember. The songs are great, but the voices are not the same. They are not just Keith Sweat anymore. I have listened to the CD a few times and I still think it's not the same Keith Sweat I remember. I'm beginning to feel a bit like I'm listening to a cover album. I think that's why I gave it two thumbs down. I'm very disappointed with this CD and I'll be returning it to Amazon.

Amazon.com: I can understand the frustration you are going through. I understand completely. Keith Sweat is such a talented singer and performer, but is not the Keith Sweat I remember. I'm truly sorry for your disappointment. I have listened to the CD several times and I still think it's not the Keith Sweat I remembered. I'm beginning to feel a bit like listening to a cover album because I'm not quite sure if it is the Keith Sweat I remember. I think that's why I gave it two thumbs down. I really hope you find your way out of this confusion and return the CD to Amazon.

Amazon.com/book: Keith Sweat was a wonderful singer who was more than just a songwriter, he was a great example of the real art of singing. His music and voice were the real stars of his act, and he will be sorely missed. I agree that this was a good CD, just not the Keith Sweat I remember.
