Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I had mixed feelings about this.  The opening couple of songs are very good.  However, they really don't go anywhere.  They just stay in the background for a long time.  The music is good.  The vocals are okay.  The lyrics are great.  The production is good.  The album is a mix of upbeat pop-rock songs, with some very tender and beautiful spoken word passages.  The album is well recorded and produced.  It's just all over the place, and really, I feel that the album could have been better.  The album ends with a wonderful, haunting rendition of "I Am The Walrus," a song that is very fitting for this album.

Amazon review: This is an incredibly well-done album.  I was disappointed that the second track is almost an entire song, but I'm glad I listened to it.

About the Album:
This album was recorded by the choir of the First Congregational Church in Boston, Massachusetts, and released by Integrity Music in 2007.

It's been 30 years since this album was released, but this is my favorite album of the 30. The song that I think is best on this album is "The Voice of the Church" and I think that this song is the best song that was recorded by the choir.

The other songs are not as great, but are good nonetheless.

"God is a Wonderful, Beautiful God" is a beautiful worship song. I have always enjoyed the way this song has been sung by the choir and the chorus is so amazing. The choir's voices are so beautiful and touching. I love the message of the message of the song, it's very important. The song is so beautiful that it's hard to describe, it is a wonderful worship song.

I love the lyrics of the song so much. The message of the message is very important. The choir's voices are beautiful too. This is a very powerful song and I think it is a powerful song of worship. I love the lyrics, I love the music. The song is so beautiful and it's so hard to describe.

"My Savior, Jesus Christ," is another beautiful worship song that I love, it is such a wonderful song that I love. The choir's voices are so beautiful and I think this song is so beautiful that it's hard to describe. The song is so beautiful and I think it's so beautiful that it's hard to describe.

Amazon review: I was very disappointed with the product I purchased. It was way overpriced and not worth it at all. I was wondering why I was getting the wrong item. I thought I bought one of the items from another website and it was being sold on Amazon. I am very disappointed in the whole process that took place. I would not buy from Amazon again if I had one. I would not recommend this company to anyone. My daughter was about to buy one of these items and it was for her birthday and the price was really cheap. I told her that she had to buy it from Amazon since they are the only ones who are making it. She decided not to buy it and I am angry with Amazon for making her do so. She would not listen to me and I told her she had to get the item from Amazon and I was not going to stop her. She was angry at me and told me that I didn't want to buy it. I went out and bought a gift card that I was going to give her for her birthday. I have to find this item and do not want this to happen to a child on a birthday. I am very upset with Amazon. It is the company and a very poor way to market products. I am not a big fan of the way they do business in general.  I would recommend people not to purchase from Amazon. I am very annoyed with the whole process and would not recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Killers since I was about 13 years old and have spent the last 8 years listening to their music. I have always been a fan of all the Killers albums, they are one of my favorite bands. I have to say this is the most disappointing album I have ever reviewed. I have to say that this album is filled with songs that have nothing to do with the Killers. I think that the people that wrote this album should listen to the band that wrote the songs and then write their own songs. I feel that this album is pretty average and that it would have been better if I had not reviewed it. I would like to give the band an opportunity to recoup some of their lost fans.

Amazon review: -Great album, very intense and emotional.  At first I thought I was the only one who hated this album- like I said it's the second one I bought. I think it's the first one I bought, or I think I bought it when I first heard the album.  Regardless, I really like it, the only negative thing I have to say is the album has no singles.  However, I think some of the members of the band may have felt the need to put out singles to help their already struggling career.  The only other negative thing I have to say is that at times it feels like they are trying to hard to sound like a great band.  If they wanted to sound like a great band they would have done that after they wrote their first album.  So when they try to sound like a great band, it is a struggle and I think it is a waste of their time and effort and it is not how they want to sound.  I also think that the Killers is one of the best bands in the world and I have always felt that the band is trying to sound as if they do not really sound like a band at all.  There is no spark or soul in this band.  They are good at what they do, and they really do it exceptionally.  I can only hope that they will continue to release albums and continue to make great music.  I hope they will continue to be the band that they are and keep making great music.  Anyway, on to the review.  I don't think this is the best album they have done, and I don't think it is the worst album they have done.  They have done some great music, but I don't think this is it.  I have been a fan of the Killers since I was about 13 and I think they have done some great music and I think they had some great albums.  I think this album is average at best and I think that the band should have continued to make great music.  I hope that they will continue to make great music and that they will continue to do what they are doing.  I think that there are some great songs on this album, and I really really love all the songs on this album.  I don't think the album is terrible, but I don't think it's good.  I have been listening to this album since I was 15 and I really like it, I don't think it's the best Killers album, but I don't think it's the worst Killers album either.  I think that it's decent, but not great.  I like the songs on this album, but I think that the album has nothing to do with the Killers, I think it has nothing to do with the music.  I think that it is average, and I think the Killers need to start making great music once again.  I hope they will start doing great music that has nothing to do with the Killers, because that is the only way they will get any fans.  I hope that they will continue to do great music and that they will keep on making great music.  I also hope that they will continue to make great music, because the fans are waiting.  Anyway, on to the review.  I don't think the album is the best Killers album because I think the album has nothing to do with the Killers, the album has nothing to do with the band, I think that the songs on the album have nothing to do with the band, I think that the album has nothing to do with the band, I think that the album has nothing and everything to do with the band, I think that the album has nothing to and everything to do with the band.  I think that the album has nothing to do with the Killers, and I think that the album has everything to do with the band.  I think that the album has everything to do with the band.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this album, but I have seen it mentioned on some of my favorite sites, such as Beatport.  Overall, it seems to be all the same stuff as on Hollow Man.

I would like to see this album get more exposure.  But it needs to be re-recorded.  There is no way I would believe anything they put out if it was not good.  Its the same exact album as Hollow Man.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I've heard of this band many times.  I finally got to see them live on a TV show I saw called "Pitbull Nation" on MTV.  I really like the music of this band and the band's videos.  I like the fact that this album is coming out on CD, which I think gives it more of a "real" feel to it.  The CD is better than the single.

Amazon review: I was excited when we got the chance to see this band live, even though the venue was sold out and the band was playing a lot of covers.  This CD is actually more than a cover CD.  It's a real band with several songs I had never heard of before.  The band has a great sound, they play with energy, and they are very entertaining.  You can tell they're having a good time, even though the venue was sold out.

Amazon review: This is the best album by this band I've heard.  I've seen them three times and have never been disappointed.  There is a lot of energy in this band.  They play with a lot of energy.  The show is fun and the music is great.  The vocals are very powerful and there's no filler.  This band really does have a lot of energy and it's contagious.  The band is very tight and the songs hold a lot of energy.  The only thing I wish they would add is a little more variety to the music.

Amazon review: I love all these bands that have come out of California.  But then I hear one and I want to buy all the albums they have released.  I love this band.  They have a great sound.  I like the fact that there is a lot of variety in the music.  It's an enjoyable listen.  There is a good pace to the songs.  The band is very tight and they have good energy.  They really entertain the audience.  I also like the fact that the band has released their new album on iTunes.  It's a nice surprise when an artist releases an album through iTunes.  This band should have released their CD through CD Baby so their fans could have bought it for much cheaper.

Amazon review: I was so bored during the summer when all the other bands were playing I had to pick up "No. 5" by this band.  It was one of the best albums I have ever heard.  I like the fact that it's on CD.  I'm a little disappointed that they didn't release this CD as a download and it was only on iTunes.  I would love to be able to buy this band's cd through iTunes, but that doesn't happen with all the different artists.  I was also interested in buying this album through iTunes because I love all the covers they've done of different songwriters.  I'm also a little disappointed that the CD doesn't have an mp3 player in it.  I would love to have a CD player in my car so I can listen to music while I'm driving.  I also want to buy the CD through iTunes, it's too expensive to buy this CD at Walmart.  I would buy this CD through iTunes before anyone else could buy it.  It would be worth it.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity!

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

She is trying to be a "rock" artist, but she is not a rock artist. In fact, she is the most boring rock artist I have ever heard. I don't understand why she plays the same songs over and over again. I don't understand why she doesn't play more new material.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

The best song on the album. I love this song and the fact that it is for sale on Amazon is just sick. I wonder who is making the money off this song. Thank you for the great service Amazon.

I love the song, but I have to admit I'm not sure why I have had to wait so long to buy this single. I guess it's because I think the other versions are better.

I think this is a great song, it's very emotional and it's sung with a great voice. I like this song in every way except the guitar solo and that's because of the fact that the guitar solo is actually the lead guitar of the song. If you listen closely you can almost hear the lead guitarist.

This is a great song. I am a big fan of Frank Sinatra. I have been listening to this song for many hours. This is the best song on this album.

I really like the song, but it's been out for a long time and I don't know why they haven't released a single like this. I guess it's because they can't get the right person to sing the lead.

This is a great song and it's a lot better than the version that is included on the CD. This version is much better.

I've been listening to this song on and off for the last year or so. I love it.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I did not like it because I was looking for LP not single. Anyways, I sent it back and I was quickly processed for money return. It was needing more information on the add.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of the band and I wanted to give them a chance, but they definitely didn't work out in the end. I mean, they played some great shows, but I'm not sure about their ability to write an album when they're not recording in a studio. The production is very inconsistent and their songs are way too long. I mean, really long. I was bored after the first couple of songs. They weren't even bad, but they weren't anything special either.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been watching them since their first two videos. I think they're a good band but if you're a fan of metal and alternative music, they're not for you. I've never understood how they can take the best parts of classic songs and rearrange them in such a way that they sound fresh and original. The songs are very boring and inane for someone who likes metal, not to mention the song length. I think they're more suited to punk rock or something like that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've seen them a few times here and there. I don't know what to say, their music sucks. You can't listen to them once, unless you go to a concert. Their singing is horrible.  They're not bad, they just are not talented. They should quit the band.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've seen them many times in the past, this is the first time I've listened to them. I have no idea what to say. I mean, I like their music, but I'm not a metal fan. Maybe their music is good for someone else. I don't know. I never liked them before either. They're not good for anyone. They're just a gimmick.

Amazon review: I love this band, they are my favorite band from last year. I thought that they would grow on me, but I just can't understand why they've only had one hit. I wish them success in every way, and I hope that they do well.
