Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review:  If you like the first two albums, this might be a good buy.  If you are a Maroon 5 fan like me, I would recommend you this album.  The lyrics are really good and the instrumentals are great.  The only problem is that with all these great songs that I have heard, I can't help but feel like there is some filler on the album.  I think that the last song of the album, "I'm Still Here" is the only filler song on the album.  This is a very good album, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a Maroon 5 fan, even if they are not a fan of the first two albums.

I would have preferred them to be all different and different.  This is the only album that has an "I'll See You in Hell" on it.  It's really good and I recommend it to anybody.

I do like "Love is a Lie" but I have heard "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" and "Love is a Lie" so I've heard them all and I like them all.  But I don't think that the other songs are as good as "Love is a Lie"

Amazon review: There are a lot of good songs on this album.  At the beginning is a sad song about love and at the end is a funny song about love.  I think that this album is good.  I just like the songs that are on it better than the ones that are on the other ones.  I would have liked it to have some songs that were better than "Truck" and some that were better than "Pumpkin Pie".  Overall I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the show.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.

McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

This is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between around 1988 and 1995. Really takes me back to that time, really good son.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I bought this record when it first came out in 1970 for $4.95. I didn't even know it was a CD until I was able to rip it from my own copy. So now I have three copies of this record, and I've been listening to it a lot. I love the "Stairway to Heaven" track. After I got my copy of this, I bought the 4-CD edition of the same album for $13.95. I've been listening to it a lot since then.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this band, especially on the covers, and this is another one that I've heard.  As with the previous one, it has that '50s feel to it that they were in the process of taking over when they started.  There is a certain sound to it that I really like, and the rhythm is nice.  The vocals are still very strong, and the band has always been good, but they seem like they're trying to outdo each other.  It's not bad, but it's not great.

Amazon review: I don't really like this album and I don't think it's a classic, but it's definitely decent.  It has a lot of the same feel as the previous album (like that's a good thing), but I don't really like the new songs, or the album as a whole.  The lead vocals on the last song are pretty bad.  The drums are ok, and the guitars are pretty good, so I can overlook the vocals.  The bass and drums are both pretty good, and the guitars are pretty good as well.  The chorus to "I'm the Man" is pretty good as well.

Amazon review: This is a very poor album.  I don't think the band has done anything for me.  If it wasn't for the cover, I would have rated it 1/5.  On the other hand, I don't think they are bad, and they are very good at making cover versions of songs.  The only song that really stands out is "I'm the Man", and it is very good.  It is the band's only real song that is good, and I would have liked to hear more of the rest of the songs.

Amazon review: This is the first time I've heard this album in a while and I liked it.  However, I agree with the other reviewer.  At first it sounded like it was an attempt by the band to try out something new but after a while it just sounds like a bunch of songs that the band really doesn't like.  I wish they would go back to the first two albums and take the best of both, I just don't like the albums as a whole.  It's a great band though and I will buy their other albums.

Amazon review: I listened to this album first and I liked it.  Then I gave it a second listen and realized it wasn't good by any means.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: This song was supposed to be a "protest song" about the lack of progress in the world.  It was released as an anti-war song against the war in Iraq.  However, it has nothing to do with Iraq and is just a song of hope for the world in general.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

I've only listened to the first song, so I'm not sure if this is a 5 star review.  The rest of them are pretty good.  At least the opening songs are interesting, but the rest are just filler.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: A tribute to the early days of jazz, this is a very unusual and excellent recording, as it is the first ever recording of The Four Freshmen, a band which has enjoyed great success and popularity, even today.  The sound quality is outstanding, with excellent bass lines, fine guitar solos and excellent trumpet playing.  The most beautiful moments are in the solos by the trumpets, which are also the most unusual ones; a rarity in jazz recordings.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: An uncharacteristically strong performance from the band, and a fine recording.  But, the real highlight of this performance is the outstanding trumpet playing, which is by far the best I've ever heard.  The trumpet section is especially strong, with the trumpets playing in unison, while the rest of the band is playing in individual parts.  The band works well together, and also works well as a unit.  This is a very good recording, and will be very popular in the future.  Highly Recommended.

The sound quality is excellent.  The guitar sound is great.  The bass sound is great.  The drums sound great.  This is a great sounding recording, and will be very popular

The guitar sounds great, the bass sound is great, the drums sound great, and the sound quality is excellent.  This is a great sounding recording, and will be very popular, and it does not get any better than this. Highly Recommended.

Weirdest Amazon review: This is the most bizarre review I have ever seen in my life!  It takes me back to when my mom got me hooked on "My Little Pony" and I started buying all kinds of stuff from Amazon.  I am sure I will end up deleting this review because it makes no sense, but I never could understand why people would want to buy a "My Little Pony" song.
I don't even know where to start with this one.  This review is completely nonsensical and there is absolutely no reason for me to read it.  If I had a penny for every time I have looked at something that was only half-way convincing when I first saw it, I would be a very rich woman.  I mean what does this review even say?  It basically says that the song is ridiculous.  I really want to give this to my friends, but I don't know if they will understand.  Is there an explanation for the song?  It has nothing to do with the song.  It's just a random video.  I don't know what to think.  I guess it's just some weird "My Little Pony" song, but I do not think it is.

Weirdest Amazon review: This is the most bizarre review ever!  I found it in my search results.  I don't know why this would be on my page of search results.  It is a random video of a random person doing something to a random toy.  I don't even have a toy like that, but I would like to get it anyway.  I am not sure if this review is even relevant, but I am going to post it anyway just to see what kind of people review this and if it is relevant or not.
The review is completely nonsensical.  I
