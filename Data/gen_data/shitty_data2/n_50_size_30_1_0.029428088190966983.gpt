Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This album is actually kind of good, but it is not what I was looking for.  I was looking for an album of his that was a bit more upbeat and an album of non-rap songs. So, I decided to try this album, and I found it to be a bit over the top.  I had originally wanted some more upbeat songs, but I needed a slower one. I feel that the album is not really Eminem's best work, but I will listen to it again once I have time to give it more thought.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the 80s so I wasn't sure what to expect from this album which was released in 1996.  I will tell you that this is a great album, overall.  There are some great songs on here such as "Lose Yourself" and "My Name is."  But the problem with the album is that it's not too accessible.  The album takes a while to get to the point where the album is actually enjoyable.  It is a very good album, but I thought as a rap album, it could have been better.  I was expecting more rap songs on this album.  I really like the album cover, but it's not what I am looking for.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I listen to this album whenever I need to get a quick pick-me-up.  It's not a great album, but it's definitely a good album.  It is the most popular album Eminem released throughout his career.  The album is a good representation of Eminem, which is a genre he is very well known for.  This album is a good representation of Em when he is on his best days.  I think this album could have been better if it was just two more songs on it.  My only problem is that the album was released in 1996 and I am not sure how much of the songs will still be relevant today.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good album.

Amazon review: I like The Slim Shady LP.  It's a great album.  It's not perfect, but it's not terrible either.  The album cover is great, but the album is a bit under-sounded.

I will definitely go back and listen to it again.

Amazon review: I am an avid fan of Eminem.  I own "The Slim Shady LP," and I am a huge fan of "Lose Yourself."  I have been a fan of Eminem since the days when his father was still in jail for murder.  I have been listening to Eminem since then, and I have always been a fan.  I think that Eminem is a great rapper, and he has done a great job with this album.  The album is pretty good, but I could have used a bit of diversity.  I would recommend this album to any fan of Eminem.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I listened to this CD on the way home from a business trip to Chicago.  I'm glad to say it was a pleasant listen.  It's not the greatest, but I enjoyed it.  I was glad to hear that the vocals were good.  I could not understand most of the words.  It's not hard to hear.

Amazon review: This was a nice listen, no complaints here. This is the second CD I have purchased from the Smokin' Jax label.  I would recommend buying this CD and leaving the previous one at home.  Smokin' Jax has a wide variety of music, from a traditional country style to a rockin' blues to a bluegrass to a jazz to a folk to a traditional folktronica to a soul.  This compilation is an excellent choice.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because I heard the music when I was a teenager and wanted to get a copy to put on the CD player at home, as I grew up listening to music from the 70s, 80s and 90s.  I got the CD and it was very relaxing and enjoyable.  I'm glad it came.

Amazon review:  There are some really great songs on this CD, but the vocals are a little over-powering and the sound is not as clear as it could be.  I also would recommend trying to find a better stereo with better sound.  I am giving this CD away as a gift to a friend.  I don't think I will listen to it enough to recommend it as a gift to a friend, but I'm sure that it is still a good CD.

Amazon review: I purchased this because it was the only CD that I could find of "The Last Post" sung by the same guy that wrote "Farewell My Lovely" on it.

I really thought I had found a gem.

Amazon review: I have purchased this product because it is about the only CD that has "The Last Post" as well as "Farewell My Lovely" on it. I was excited to find the two songs in this CD because I thought it would be a nice surprise. To my surprise, however, the songs on this CD are all generic ballads, performed by people who would seem to be incapable of singing the songs themselves. I was never particularly interested in the songs themselves, but rather the fact that they were sung by the same people who wrote them. I also did not find much variety in the songs, and when I did, it was usually not a good variety, either. I was disappointed when I saw that "Last Post" featured several songs from the same musician, and that "Farewell My Lovely" included songs written by John Denver. I purchased this CD because I thought it would be a nice surprise, but I would not recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Twiztid is a great group, but their album "This Is Twiztid Vol. 1" just isn't as good as the first one.  I personally believe that the songs on this album are way to long and too much time is spend on the lyrics and rapping.  The album is a great way for Twiztid to raise some money from their fans,  but instead of doing that they have spent money to change their image to a new one with the help of a new manager.  The album is simply not that great as it is.  I would recommend this to anyone but the fan who is more into the first album.  I would not put this one in my top ten,  but it is a great album for people who like rap.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I got this album for free,  when I opened the package, I knew I was in for a treat,  this is not a album you will put on your shelf for years to come.  I am not a Twiztid fan,  but the fact that they put out an album that I truly don't like or at least didn't enjoy was a surprise.  The album is filled with filler tracks and over rated songs and vocals.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan of Twiztid from the beginning,  I am glad that they have put out a new album that I have not heard before,  I have been waiting for them to release an album for a long time.  I am disappointed,  it doesn't get better with each new release,  I could have been happier.

Amazon review: I love this album,  if I had spent my money on this album,  I would have been pleased with its content.  The songs would have been great if they were sung by Twiztid,  but they aren't.  This is a great album for fans of rap music, the songs are the best in the world.  I have been listening to this album for 4 years now,  I am happy about that.  I am just disappointed in the way the album is presented.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a fan of Twiztid as I have been for years,  I have been waiting for this album and I am glad that it is finally here.  I am happy the songs are real and not overdone,  I am happy that they are not just rapping on the songs.  I have been waiting for this album for a long time and I am beyond happy that it is finally here.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have only listened to this album a little bit,  I have heard a few songs and I am not a fan of the song "Get Down"  It is not bad,  but it is just a filler song that doesn't stand out as much as the rest of the songs on the album.  The album is full of filler songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think Twiztid were actually trying to do something new and exciting with this album,  but it just didn't work.  The album is filled with songs that are not really about Twiztid or rap and songs that are just really long and boring.  If you are a fan of rap you probably won't like this album,  if you are not a fan it is not worth the money that you had to spend on it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Very good.  I only listen to a few blues artists and this one is one of them.  I will always have a special place in my heart for Bob Johnson, not just because he was a blues legend but because of the way he sang his songs...even though he didn't try to sing like a blues singer.  I really love the way he sang "Ain't it a Shame" - it's just the way he sings it, in a way that makes you feel he's singing out of the heart, a kind of purity.  It's really amazing.  I love Bob Johnson's songs, he's a legend.

Amazon review: I've been waiting for this cd for 8 months. But I didn't get it for 6 months. And I had to get this cd from Amazon because Amazon has better deals than most music stores.  I found this CD at a great price.  It was a good deal.  I hope you will get this CD as soon as you can.

Amazon review: I am sorry to say, but I am disappointed with this cd.  I got this cd because I'm a blues fan, and I've never purchased a new cd before.  I've been waiting for this CD to come out, to be honest, for 8 months.  I went to the "newest" Amazon music store today to buy it, and I was told by the manager, that I could not purchase this cd for a couple of days, because someone else had already pre-ordered this cd.  So I went back to the store where I first pre-ordered this cd, and they couldn't get the stock to sell.  I got to the store on Friday, and I finally got a manager to give me a CD, and they said, "We did not get enough stock to sell to you."  I went on the internet to find out why.  I found this site, where someone had the same problem, and they finally got their CD.  I finally got my CD, and I bought it.  It was a great deal.  I don't know what other people think of this album, but I think I'm pretty happy with it.  I love the way the songs flow, and the guitar work is great.  The album was bought for a little more than $1.00.  It's a great deal, and a great cd.  I'll be buying more CDs from Amazon, and I hope that everyone else will, too.  I just thought I'd give you feedback on this cd.  I hope you get your CD soon, if you haven't already.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: This is not the accapella. This is labeled incorrectly. I purchased it because someone else wrote that it was in fact the accapella but that is not true.

Amazon review: I was hoping for an album with more acoustic songs, but this is definitely a good album. I loved how the lyrics and music are intertwining and there aren't any bad songs. This album is a great example of how a lot of artists, be it the Beatles or even Lady Gaga, are influenced by the same artists.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a really good album. I loved the songs and the overall feel. Although there are a lot of different styles, there is nothing that is too over the top. There is a very nice balance for the album, but it is mostly about mood and a song that has that mood will be just right.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I can't believe I just bought this album. That is a really weird feeling. I can listen to this album all day long. I like that you have three different styles. I like that some songs are a little more pop than others. I also like that it isn't over the top. I don't know if it is because I am a guy, but I like the lyrics and the music is pretty good.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD has a lot of different styles, but the songs are all good. There are a lot of different types of music on the album, but it is all really good. I would have really liked to hear more of the songs I've heard so far. I can't wait to listen to the next album.

Amazon review: I'm not sure which is better, this album or The Beatles. I'm not really sure. I like that this album is so different. The songs are very different, but the album is really good.

Amazon review: This album is a good example of what happens when you pair good music with amazing lyrics. Even the non-country songs are amazing. The only song I didn't like on the album was "I'm Not You," but it is the only song on the album that is on the same note. The rest of the songs are all really good. I like how the songs are almost all about love. There is a good balance for the songs and the album. I would recommend this album, but I think it is a little more popular than it should be.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album just has so many songs that you will have to listen to to hear all of them. But honestly, I like that. I don't like the songs too much, but who doesn't like good music.

It is a great album and I think that people should listen to it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album has a lot of different songs, but each song has a very unique and beautiful message.

It makes them stand out and is an amazing album.

Amazon reviewer: When I first heard this song I thought that Danzig had left off his voice, but it turns out the guy in the video is the same guy who wrote the lyrics to this song, and it was made popular through a contest run by Danzig in which he promised that if the winner could provide him a song the singer would be his. The video shows what appears to be a house that is being watched and a door that is being opened. The singer is on a couch, and has a very eerie voice. The song is really eerie, and is one that can take you deeper into your fears.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was not familiar with Jewel's music until I started listening to this. I love it. She did a great job, and the whole album is good. The only problem is that I think it would have been better if it had gone on another 3 songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I downloaded this song because it was on the list of songs for my job interview. I was actually very excited to be seeing this singer. I had heard her in a few interviews and I had heard her pop songs in my car with my windows down. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the song and how it came out. I would really like to hear more of her music.

Amazon review: Just wanted to say this has been a wonderful experience. I am writing to say how much I enjoy listening to this song. It is beautiful, and is one that I will listen to often.

Amazon review: I have a lot of music on my ipod, but I have recently been really craving some good songs on my phone. I found this music through the free song downloads. I have never heard of Jewel. I am glad that I found a good song. I will download more of her music. Thanks for the download.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is the first CD I have purchased on Amazon.com.  I have several music CDs and I am a fan of the musical genre known as Christian Music.  There is a wide range of music, from the more popular music of today to the more obscure.  I have been searching for a CD that would bring out the sound of the Gospel Music and allow me to enjoy a variety of music.  I can appreciate the music on the CD I purchased,  Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
