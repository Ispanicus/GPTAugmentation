Amazon review: This is not a bad album but I bought this one to get back in country music. I bought it because I wanted to start listening to country again. At first I listened to it for a couple of weeks and thought it was ok but then I could tell it was not the same as country music. I am not sure why but I thought the songs sounded like pop music. I really don't know what to think anymore.

The new songs are so different that I don't know if I'll ever listen to others like it again. I like the new songs better than the old songs, but I do like the old songs and would love to hear them performed by others.  However, I think it's an album that is very good for those who are new to this style. This album is an example of the music I love.  I'll always have this album with me.  I don't have to listen to anything else.  It's my jam.

Amazon review: I've been playing this album since I heard the first song.  It's everything I was looking for in a new band.  It takes a lot of what I like about rock and roll and adds a lot of freshness and diversity that I haven't heard often.  The last two albums I've seen them live, they were amazing, and they were even better on the CD.  This is one of the best CDs I've ever heard in my life.  I've seen them live twice, and they have been amazing.  The band rocks.  The music rocks.  This is the first CD I've ever had that I felt like I was missing out on something, and I didn't know what it was because it wasn't a new album.  I've only heard one CD from this band, and I bought this.  It's an amazing album.  I'm hooked.  I've seen them live many times, and I can tell that they will be playing here soon.  I highly recommend this band to anyone that is looking for a new sound on their collection.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  I would recommend to everyone.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.

I don't like the generic rock and roll, and this is a great mix of rock with a different sound.  The band is always good to listen to.  The band is just good to have as a new band to listen to.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band since the beginning.  This is simply the best.  They really are a new group, and it shows.  I love the new songs on the album and the old songs are great too.  I don't get where they get the name.  It's not a name like, "The Beatles" or "The Rolling Stones", it's a name that shows the diversity of the group.  This group is very diverse.  The group has something for everybody.  There is something for everyone.  It's very good to listen to.  I don't believe a word they say, they are just good at what they do.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I love this song!  Now, I know what you're thinking:  What can you say about a song that starts out with the title "Bad Romance"?  Well, it's the story of how we met and fell for each other and I think you can tell that this song makes us a couple.  I don't know what it is about it that makes me like it.  It's a great song.  I wish it had been longer, but it's still great.  I'm sure that Lady Gaga will appreciate this song too.

Amazon review: This really doesn't sound like Gaga.  I really didn't expect it to be at all, because I thought she would have made a much more generic song.  This is a good song.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I guess I wasn't the only one annoyed by Gaga's choice.  And I don't mean her choice for the songs.  I mean her choice for the story.  I don't know what she was thinking.  I'm not sure it's even like a real story.  It's more of a soap opera.  And I still don't get why she would choose this song.  I don't know what she was thinking.  I'm pretty sure she could have made something that was more popular.  It's not a great song.  I'm not sure it's even a good song.  I'm sure it's a great song.  I think it's really good.  And I think it's really a great song.  If it wasn't for Lady Gaga, I would not even have seen this.  I just wish she would have made it on her own.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really didn't expect this song to be so good.  I was thinking it was another typical song from Lady Gaga.  I wasn't expecting anything other than that.  I'm glad it was so good.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is one of her best.  I really love it and I really hope she does more of these.  It's definitely a great song.  The one I'm most disappointed with is "Bad Romance."

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Total ripoff!  This is NOT the whole song, it's like a 30 second sound bite from the song.  I would request a refund except it's not worth my time for $1.29.  Save yourself a buck and don't buy this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am not familiar with this band, but I am familiar with bands that play in bars with loud music and bad sound.  I don't think this disc is worth the price.  It is like someone took a CD from a bar with a DJ and threw it into a CD player in a house.  The audio quality of the music is awful.  I can't believe that someone would willingly give this $1.29 for such low quality.  I feel robbed.

Amazon review: I bought this music CD from a local record store in Santa Cruz, California.  I had heard about this band's music, and I wanted to check them out.  The CD was a $50 value and I decided to buy it.  I was looking forward to hearing this CD.  To be honest, this CD is very boring.  There are some good songs on it, but most of the songs sound like they were recorded in a bar and then edited with an audio editing software.  Most of the songs are overplayed and repetitive.  Some of the songs just don't sound like they were recorded at all, but I guess that's what happens when the music is recorded in a bar.  I will not buy this CD.  I just can't stand to listen to the same songs over and over.  I am not sure why they have released this CD, but I don't like this CD at all.  It is not worth my money.

Amazon review: This is an excellent collection of songs that never get old.  The songs are great, but the production is terrible.  This CD is one of the worst CDs I have ever listened to.  If you can't stand the music of this band you need to get yourself a new CD player.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me.

Amazon review: I've always liked the music of Billy Currington. That being said, I'm not crazy about this album. The only good thing about this album is that it's a live album. That's the only reason I'm rating it a 4. The songs are great but the overall production is terrible. The songs are all recorded on a single mic and the vocals are mixed in the same room. It doesn't sound like a live recording. The music sounds great but it's not a live recording. The vocals are great but the songs are all recorded on a single mic and the vocals are mixed in a small room. The drums are mixed in the same room as the vocals. The music sounds great but the vocals are recorded in a small room. Also the album sounds different from the live recording. The live recording is a little deeper than on this album. I like the energy of this live album.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review:  This is the second song I have heard in the compilation.  I like it a lot.  I like the bassline and the synth line.  I like the way the guitar line is played.  It is very strong in the beginning.  It is very good.  As the song goes on, however, it gets to be too repetitive.  The sound is very boring, and the instrumentation is too weak.  I would give it a 10.5, but I would not rate it higher than a 9.5.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: First, the sound quality is poor.  The sound of the instrument is bad.  The instrumentation is very dull.  There is nothing really special about the song.  It is not bad, but I think it is bad.  To be honest, I thought it was very boring.  The song has only one good part, so I am giving it a 8.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

I'm not a huge fan of this album. I think its quality is very good, but the songs are not very memorable. I thought the album would be better with a full release of the songs.

This album was definitely under appreciated when it was released. I'm not sure why it has gone out of print. I guess that it was just a bad batch of recordings or that it didn't sell well.

I don't understand how people don't like this disc. It's very good music and well recorded. I like the music.

The only good song on this album is "I'm Not A Huge Fan Of This Album" but that's really the only good song on this album. The rest is forgettable.

I really liked the music on this disc. This is one of the best albums I have ever heard.
