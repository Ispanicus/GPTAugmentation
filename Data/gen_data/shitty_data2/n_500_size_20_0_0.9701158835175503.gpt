Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: I really don't know what to make of this album. It took me about 2 hours to get through it. The songs are catchy and the lyrics are funny, but the album is just a bunch of other musicians playing their instruments. There are no real hooks, just random songs on the album.

Amazon review: I think this album is a great example of how it's possible to create an album that is so strong in parts and yet so weak in others.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I got the free sample and found it to be good, but the music is so much better than any of the songs from the studio albums. The drums are so deep and heavy, the bass is deep and heavy, the guitar is deep and heavy. The vocals are deep and heavy, and not at all cheesy or cliche. The song starts with an intense bassline, followed by a big loud bass sound and then more deep bass, and then more vocals. It is a very intense song that is very popular.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The first three tracks are pretty much all instrumentals.  They're all pretty good, but I don't think there's much to say about them.  The fourth track is pretty good.  The fifth track is actually pretty good, but I think it should've been called "The Last Song", because it's the last song.  The sixth track is the closest to a ballad of the album, but it's the weakest of the album.  The seventh track is pretty good, but I don't think it's a real stand-out song.  The eighth track has nothing special.  The ninth track has some nice, interesting stuff at the end, but it's not really a stand-out song.  The tenth track is pretty good, but it's a ballad, so it's not the most memorable of the album.  The eleventh track is another ballad.  The twelfth track is sorta like a ballad, but it's an instrumental.  The thirteenth track is actually a ballad, which I know, but I'm not going to go into the song just yet.  The fourteenth track is another ballad.  The fifteenth track is another ballad.  The sixteenth track is another ballad.  I'm going to go into the seventeenth track for the fifteenth track.  The song's an instrumental.  It's pretty good.  The eighteenth track is another instrumental.  The nineteenth track is another instrumental.  The twentieth track is another instrumental.  The twenty-first track is the only song on the album that's a real stand-out song.  The twenty-second track is an instrumental, and it's really good.  The twenty-third track is another instrumental.  The twenty-fourth track is another instrumental.  The twenty-fifth track is another instrumental, and it's really good.  The thirtieth track is the only song on the album that's not an instrumental.  The thirty-first track is the only song on the album that's not an instrumental.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I was very excited to listen to this album. My mother is a huge fan of Pink Floyd and I have listened to this album many times before. What I like about the whole album is that it is not overbearing or pretentious. There is a little bit of self deprecation on there but it is not to the point of being overbearing, just a little bit. My mother has tried to put me in my place about the whole Pink Floyd album thing. I have always been a fan of Pink Floyd and I think that is why my mother is so excited to get me in the car when I put on this album. I think she is looking for something good to give me.

Amazon review: I received this CD. It is very disappointing. I ordered it on the 10th of Oct. and it was not delivered until the 14th of Dec. I contacted Amazon.com and they were very unhelpful. They told me to call technical support, which I did. I spoke with a lady and she said that there must be a problem with the internet and that my order would be shipped out that day. I told her that I had ordered it on the 10th of Oct. and that it had not been shipped on that day. She said that she would call Amazon.com support and they would get back to me. That never happened. I called the next day and spoke with someone else. She told me that my order had not been shipped out that day and that they would try to get me a refund and then re-order the CD. The refund never happened. I spoke with a woman named Lisa and she told me that the CD was not going to be shipped out. I tried calling her back and she never answered my calls. I called again this morning and asked for a refund on this product. She told me that she was not going to refund me and that I would have to call back in a few days. I called the next day and spoke with someone named Lisa. She told me that she was not going to refund me. I then called customer service and spoke with someone named Jennifer. She told me that she was going to refund me and that they would call me back. I told her that I was not going to listen to her and that I was going to call customer service. She then called me back and said that I could call her back and that she would call me back. I told her that she was lying and hung up on her. I then called customer service again. The lady that answered the phone was not the one that I talked to on the phone earlier. She was a male. She told me that I could call another customer service person and that they would call me back. I am now calling someone named Lisa back. I am now calling someone named Jennifer back. She is going to refund me, but she will call me back in a few days. I will report this to Amazon.com. I will give you an honest review if you do not refund me. I would also like to hear your comments on this product. I would like Amazon.com to refund me on my product and make sure that this product does not show up on Amazon.com for the next 2 months.

Amazon review: I love the Killers.  I have never been disappointed by a Killers album.  I am a fan of both bands.  But this album was a little disappointing.  I expected more from the Killers.  I want to hear more and more from them.  I want to hear more and more from Killers.  But this album was just really bad.

Amazon review: I had heard rumors that this album had been put together years ago.  I had been holding on to it for a while.  I had been waiting for a special moment so I could finally listen to it.  I was excited because I thought this album had been put together by Brandon and Andrew.  I was surprised that the album actually came out last week.  That is a few months later.  I went to the store and I couldn't find it.  I thought that something was wrong.  I went to the website but nothing was there.  I was upset because I thought I had ordered it.  My mom found my package.  The box was full of CDs.  I was confused.  I thought I had ordered the Killers.  I was confused because I had not ordered this album.  I thought I had ordered the Killers.  I tried to call the band, but no one answered.  I left a message, but no one answered.  I didn't bother waiting for a response.  I just went to the store and I bought this album.

Amazon review: I bought this cd because I like the Killers.  I thought this cd would be like a mix of their older music like "New Divide" and "Killers".  It had too many songs to fit on one CD.  I am glad I bought it because it has good songs on it.  It is a little boring though.  The album starts off with a song I didn't like.  Then there is one song I liked.  Then there are two songs I didn't like.  Then there are two songs I liked.  Then there are four songs I liked.  Then there are two songs I didn't like. Then there are one song I didn't like.

From the looks of it, the album is a double CD, with the two discs having the same track list with some songs that appear on both CDs. The first disc being the CD side, and the second side being the Vinyl Disc. The vinyl disc is about an inch shorter than the CD, so I'm assuming the vinyl disc is a compilation album, but I have no idea what that compilation is.

*I'd like to add that while this is a relatively "new" release, this CD is the second one I've purchased from this artist. The first one was released in 2006, and I've been enjoying it immensely. The songs on each of these CDs are not exactly alike, but they are similar enough that it's hard to tell which is the newer one.

I hope I don't fall into the common "I like all of his albums" trap, but I really do love this artist. I have no need for a "new" artist, as I already have a large discography of my own. To be honest, I'm surprised that there is so much good music out there, and I'm not even sure if most of it is available to me.

So, I've purchased the album, and I have to say it's a good one. I like the album, but I'm not 100% sold on every song on it, as we're all entitled to our own opinions. The album does have a few albums that didn't really do much for me, but that's all they are.

The vocals are really good here, and it's a nice change of pace from "normal" music. There really is nothing that stands out on the album, but it's still very enjoyable, and I look forward to more from this artist.

*This album was released on February 16, 2017. I'm not sure if it's a re-release, or if it's a compilation, but I'm assuming this is the second CD version of the album.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this cd. I found this CD at the bottom of a pile of CDs at the Salvation Army after a friend suggested I give it a try. I bought it expecting a lot of filler, but it turned out to be pretty good, and I've been listening to it non-stop for over 10 days. The problem is, the first time I listened to it I was very upset and angry, but then I sat down and listened to it over and over again and realized that it was the best CD I've ever listened to in my whole life. It's got some really good songs, and the lyrics are good. It's great to listen to songs that you've never heard before! At first I thought the CD was a rip-off, but I eventually realized that the tunes were all original, while the lyrics could have been ripped from the original CDs. I'm really glad that I decided to try it out.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Maybe it was just my opinion.  I like the songs but I wish this album were longer.  To all the fans of the artist I am a fan of...  I wish I was more of a fan.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for weeks and I still haven't made up my mind about it.  It's a very good album, I like the fact that it's been released under one name (as opposed to the normal practice of a band having a stage name).  The instrumentals are beautiful and the lyrics are great.  I would recommend buying this album for those who like instrumental music with a little bit of substance.  I am very disappointed in the fact that the original song on this album is the shortest song on the album at just a few minutes long.  The other three are longer.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
