Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I bought this, because I enjoy listening to Latin music. The tracks are great, the vocals are pretty good, and the arrangements are excellent. I bought this album expecting to hear only the songs in English, and it turns out that some of the songs (like "Para Siempre" and "Cómo Me Haces (En Vivo)" are in Spanish. I'm not sure what's going on with this album, but it's worth a try.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was in a very good mood when I listened to this album. However, I was disappointed that I realized too late that the track "Para Siempre" was in Spanish! I am not sure how I could have missed it. Anyway, the album is great and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Latin music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I thought that this album was going to be great, but I was a bit disappointed. The songs are too short and I had to skip the "Para Siempre" song. I'm sure that this album would be great for an adult audience.

Amazon review: My first Latin album. The album is very good. The vocals are great and the songs are long. "El Día Que No Se Perdona" is a good song. The album has a very interesting arrangements. I enjoyed the album a lot. I would recommend the album to friends.

Amazon review: What a great time I had listening to this CD in the car yesterday.  The songs are great, the vocals are great, and the musicianship is great.  I bought my wife a CD player for Christmas, and it sure is nice to have a CD player that plays only CD's.  The only problem is that I can't seem to get it to play CDs that have a "CD" or "CD-ROM" label on them.  I have tried many different CD players, but to no avail.  The CD player that I have worked with is a Sony CD Player, 1.7GB, and it has only one CD drive, but the CD drive is not working.  I have read that the CD drive has to be replaced, but I am not sure if this applies to the CD player I have.  Anyway, this is a great album and I would recommend it to anyone who loves Latin music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have purchased several CDs from Latin American artists, and I have to say that this album is by far the best that I have purchased.  I have tried the last two CD's that I have purchased from "Latin Diva" (Luis Miguel and Thalia) and both have been very disappointing.  "Para Siempre" is a very beautiful song, but it is in Spanish.  I have no idea why "Para Siempre" is in Spanish.  My wife is going to get this album, and she is going to enjoy it.  "Cómo Me Haces (En Vivo)" is a very beautiful song, but it is in Spanish.  I also have not been able to find a translation for the Spanish version of this song, so she may have to learn it from scratch.  I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who loves Latin music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is great. The songs are all well-written and the musicianship is great.  I bought this album because I love Latin music and I thought that it would be a great way to spend Christmas.  I was extremely disappointed to find out that the album is in Spanish.  I would buy it just to have the Spanish language on the CD.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Latin music.

##  My Space: Music of the Future

###  Amazon review: The only thing to say is that it's not even in the same league as the big boys.  If this is how they are going to do the music then it's not for me.  The way the songs are put together, you can tell they are trying to compete with the big boys but they're not even close.  It's just bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a mess.  I don't like the "my space" part.  It makes me think it's a school and they are trying to get people to go there.  I don't think it's an appropriate use of the word.  It's probably just a way to promote you to go there.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think it's just a way to get you to go there.  It could be a business, but I don't think it is.  The songs are all very generic and you don't have any idea what you're going to get.  I don't think it's going to be any good and I don't think it's going to be what I would call good.

It's a mess.  I don't like the "my space," "my world," "my music," "my place," "my town."  It's just too vague.  It's a mess.

##  MySpace: Music of the Future

###  Amazon review:  I'm not a fan of the MySpace/Google/Yahoo Music thing.  I don't know why everybody does it.  I never did it, but I hear about it, people talk about it, people just do it all the time.  I don't see why people do it.  It's like "MySpace."  It's like "Yahoo!"  There's no reason for it.  I don't like it.  It's just annoying.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The only way I could understand it is if somebody told me they did it.  But that's not what they do.  It's just a way to get people to go there.

##  MySpace: Music

###  Amazon review:  I don't like MySpace.  I don't like the way it is put together.  I don't like the way it all comes out at once and all the songs are coming out of it.  I hate the way they just put the songs out.  It's not that I don't like the way it has been put together.  I just don't like it.  I just don't like it.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  I understand the way it works.  I understand the way it works, but I don't like how it works.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: this album was well written.  the songs are very catchy and easy to listen to.  I do have a couple of minor complaints about the album.  The song "Rising Sun" is extremely repetitive and I get the feeling that the song was written by at least three people.  The song "My Time Is Now" is very repetitive and has the same chorus for every verse.  The last song on the album is "The Man Who Lives in a Car" and although the song is very catchy, it is a bit too repetitive. Overall, the album is well written and well listenable.  However, the last song is not a good song and should have been left off the album.  I would recommend this album to all fans of the blues.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love the way you guys play the blues, and your musicianship.  I have listened to many blues albums.  As a blues player myself, I have been fortunate enough to be able to see the blues in person.  However, I now have a friend who is a musician, (guitar, bass, drums, and vocals) who I have played blues with on a few occasions.  His band, The G.U.S.E.  (I know, it sounds like a typo) plays a very deep, sophisticated and smooth style of blues.  I am a huge fan of their music, and I decided to purchase their first album.

However, I thought the lyrics were a little too corny.

I've got a lot of positive things to say about this CD, but I'll start with the downside. This is a very good recording, but the vocals are a bit dry and I feel that the songs are a bit too short. That said, there are some very good songs on here, and the album overall is very entertaining, but the vocals are a bit hard to listen to. For a 5 bucks CD, maybe this is worth it.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was really glad to find out that this is a real band.  The only problem I have with this CD is that I found it hard to understand what all the parts of the songs were saying.  The way they are arranged is just a little too "random" and the melodies and harmony of the songs are not what I would call "melodic."  I have also had a problem with the vocalists.  They all have a very high voice and can sing in a variety of ranges, so it can be hard to get a good sound out of their voices.  I also found the "melodies" of their voices just a little bit too "vague" and "muddy" for me to hear clearly.  I will have to listen to the whole CD again to see if I can get a better understanding of the tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  A beautiful performance of the music of Rachmaninoff.  The performance is beautiful and the performance is very well done.  The singers have excellent control of their voices and their musicality is top notch.  The only let down is that there are only five songs and I could have done with six or seven.  Although this is a beautiful performance, it really is not the sum of the parts of the five songs.  The arrangement and the tempo of the songs are just a little bit off for me.  This is probably one of the best pieces of classical music I have ever heard.  I really enjoyed listening to this music and would like to see more classical music like this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This recording of the classical music of the Great Russians is very well done.  The music is very well recorded and the arrangements and soloists are all well done.  The only thing that might be slightly questionable is the sound of the recording equipment.  It is not as clear as it could be.  But, this recording is very fine and should be an excellent addition to any classical collection.  This recording is very well done and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning about the sound of Russian music.

The only thing I didn't like about this CD was that the melodies and structure of the songs were just a little bit too "off" for me to hear clearly.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

A great song indeed, but I wish it was longer and could have had a few more verses.

I have a serious problem with the song because it's a very personal type of song, and makes me feel like the guy in the song is talking to me. The song just doesn't make any sense. The singer says, "I'm going to go out for a walk, you know what it's about." And then he goes out and walks and talks to the guy in the song. He's talking to the guy, but he's singing to the person. It just doesn't make any sense. I wish they expanded the song. I wish they just would have had a verse about the guy sitting on the bench in the park.

I also wish they had made the song more personal. Like, I have a great boyfriend, and I was at the park and he was sitting on a bench talking to me. I wish that they would have made that one more personal. But it was still a good song.

I'd like to recommend this album to everyone. It was good. I really enjoyed it.

*NOTE* I haven't had any issues with the album in my recent purchases. I've had it for a while and haven't had any issues.

My brother gave this to me when I was in middle school. I can't believe how it has faded.

This is a good album. I have no problems with it. It is not too heavy or too light. Well, maybe you can find some good songs on this album.

I was surprised that this track is not on the CD but it is the only track that's on the CD. It is a nice song that is a good example of the group's sound. It has a good beat and nice vocals and lyrics.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The new record is definitely better than the last one.  The melodies are stronger, and it's more of a cohesive group effort. I've been a fan for so long, and this new album is a return to form for the band.  They have added a new member, and he's definitely been a help.  I've come to appreciate the band's sound and style a lot more.  I've been listening to them more than ever lately, and the sound has opened my mind.  The last album was a bit too cluttered, and this album is a much cleaner, tighter listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The band's musical style is unique and very catchy.  The band members all have their own style and own unique sound.  There is a lot of musical talent on this album and the band really shines on this one.  There are some songs on this album that are very repetitive, but the music is very catchy the majority of the time.  The lyrics are about love, life, and the trials of life.  It's an interesting and meaningful album that can be enjoyed by anyone who is open to the idea of a good old time rock and roll band.

I think the reason it's not more popular is because it's easy for people to sing along to. That's why I think it should have been in the Country Singles Chart. It would've been the 1st single in the country chart.

I don't believe it would be any different from a standard country song. The only difference with this song is that it is in the Country Singles chart.

The video was very good. I like it when there is a surprise at the end.

Overall, I would give it a seven star rating. It was good.

This is a great song. I am not sure why it was not as popular with the people. I would have to agree and say, it is not bad. The video was very good. There is nothing much to dislike about this song.

I think the reason it's not more popular is because the lyrics are not very catchy. That's why I think it should have been in the Country Singes chart. It would have been the 1st single in the country chart.

I donot believe it would be any different from a standard country song. The only different is that it is in the Country Singles chart.

The song was pretty good. I like the song. I like the video. I like the lyrics. I think the song is good. I would give it a 7.0 out of 10.

I have a problem with the song and the lyrics. I think they are too much like the original country music. The reason for that is that they are so repetitive.

I find it difficult to listen to. They are not that catchy or that memorable.

Overall, I would give it a 6.5 out of 10. It was good.

This is a great song. I like the song and video. I think it is a good country song.

I like the song and video. It's a good country song.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The music was everything I could hope for. A true masterpiece.  I am very, very pleased with this purchase.  I have only one complaint.  The song I wanted was not included on the CD.

I have always loved this album, from the opening theme to the last song.
I was very surprised to discover how much I loved this album, and how much I needed it.
The songs are very well-written and very well-played.  The lyrics are very meaningful.  The music is very well-played, and the arrangements are so beautiful to listen to.  For the price, you would expect a lot more.
The only problem I had with the album was that it was not available on CD.
I would recommend this album and this release to anybody who is interested in a quality album of great music that everyone can enjoy."

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I am very glad that I found out about this group.  This group is the first band that I have found that I could go to and be able to have a good time.  They have been to my church now and I have had some great times with them.  They are very very nice and have a special way to communicate with each other.  This is the best cd that I have ever heard and I have never listen to any type of music that has made me feel the way this cd has made me feel.  I am not a Christian, but I have always been a fan of Christian music.  I hope to have the opportunity to go see them again.  This is the first time I have listened to them live.  I love listening to these type of music.  I would give it four stars.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is an album i got from my dad's friend. he's a musician and a die hard true believer of the west coast hard rock scene. I have to admit, I've been on the fence with it for about two weeks now. I've listened to it twice just to get a feel for it. I just can't get a handle on it. Its soo boring and boring. I have to say, the bass guitar is actually one of the worst i've ever heard. The vocals are just soo generic, just like the rest of the album. I understand it has a lot of good songs, but i just don't feel like this album has any musical worth to it. I guess i will give it another shot the next time i get it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've listened to this album a couple of times, and I gotta say, its pretty good. Just doesn't have the vibe of a west coast hard rock album, but there is enough good songs on here to convince me. So far, not a bad album. My only issue is the lack of diversity on the band. This is the first time I've heard any of the band's music, so I don't really know anything about them, so i don't know if they are bad or not.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I guess if you don't like the band, you don't like the album.  That being said, it's definitely a lot better than you would expect.  It's certainly not bad like some of the other reviews have made it out to be.  But this is the first time I have heard the new album from this band and I have to say I am really dissapointed with it.  It's a pretty good album.  If I had to nit pick, it would be the bass and drums are lacking a bit of the old spark.  But on the whole, I think it's a pretty good album.  But I do have to feel dissapointed with this album, because the band has not been in the studio in over 10 years and I wish they would have at least done one more album.  I know this is the first new album by Twiztid and I'm not complaining, but just saying, there should have been at least one more.

Amazon review: I really liked this album by the way.  I really could not believe how good it was, and as much as I think that it's a little too early to judge the new album, and that there are still a lot of new songs to come, I really do love this album and think that it's a very good album.  It's definitely one of my favorite albums for 2008.  I know for a fact that it was written in 2007, and that's what I'm looking forward to.  I don't know if it's a good or bad sign for me that my favorite album is from 2007, but I'm not complaining.  I know I'm not the only person who thinks it's one of the best albums of 2008, and that's what counts.  I hope that they will do a new album soon.

I've been listening to this album for a while now, and I'm glad the label decided to put this on CD because I really appreciate how the band has been put together.

I think I may have heard these songs before somewhere, but it is not really clear to me where.  The lyrics are beautiful, and the music is magnificent.  I don't know what part of my life would be complete without a recording of "The Way It Is" or "I Don't Have A Clue".                The lyrics and music are so fresh, that I don't think I will ever tire of them.               And I know that other people will, too, because they will hear these songs, and they will be reminded of the wonderful lives they live and the wonderful things that happen to them.             I hope the world will listen to these songs, and learn something from them.

Amazon review:  This is a great album. The opening song is "I Don't Have A Clue" which is a great, emotional ballad.     I have been enjoying all the songs on this album - they are all excellent.         I have to say that there are a few songs on this album that I have never heard before, and it is nice to have that new experience.              "The Way It Is" is my favorite track on this album.              It was one of those songs that you listened to again and again and thought, 'It's not quite right but I can't quite put my finger on it'.               It is a true classic, and one that I will be listening to over and over again.

I don't really know how to describe the music on this album.           I will say that it is pop, and it is a little bit of rock.              I like that the melodies are not overused, but instead are used to create an atmosphere of emotion.              The harmonies are very good, and make this the sort of album that I can listen to over and over again.              This is my favorite album in all of rock.

Amazon review:   This album was recorded by my father and me.             I was a little bit older than my dad when we recorded this album, and I think that it shows in the music that we made.              Most of our music is based around the use of auto-tune, and the way that it makes you want to listen to the music more and more, and the way that you get lost in the sound of the music.
