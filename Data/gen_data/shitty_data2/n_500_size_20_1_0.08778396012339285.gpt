Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: It's a pretty good song.  However, the fact that the lead singer (Ne-yo) would rather be a guy instead of a woman is what makes the song so bad.  The song is all about how men want to be boys and women want to be girls and that's the way it's supposed to be.

Amazon review: I had my first baby at 23. After a few years, I figured I needed a break from everything. I started to date the same person. I had been married for almost 9 years and I still loved him. We had been together for 2 months. I wanted to start a family with someone I loved. We would go to the same church. Two months in, I met his friend, he saw me, and the look on his face when he saw me, was the most beautiful thing. There was no fear in him. He told me that if I ever got serious about my baby, he would be the father. He told me that we could make a family with me. He loved me, I loved him. We were together for almost 7 years. I loved the child. I had my life planned out. He was the father of my child and our child. We didn't know where or when. We didn't know he was going to die. I was pregnant and he was dying. I had been praying for him. I was praying for our child. I had my child and it was a miracle because I never doubted God. I had found my love and he was going to change my life. He was going to be a blessing to our child. We were in love. When I had been married for years, I thought I was married. I was not married. I had been married for 5 years but I thought I was married.

If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: I bought this cd because I love the songs on it.  It's all about a man who is trying to find his way back to love from all he has been through.  The songs are very good and I would buy it again.  I would be willing to pay a little more than the recommended price.

Amazon review: I know I am probably in the minority, but I've really enjoyed the songs on this CD.  I really like the album.  I bought it for my son when he was in the hospital.  He had a tumor that was pressing on his stomach and it was pushing on every organ in his body.  This album really helped him sleep and when he took his meds he would talk and laugh.  I played the songs to him, and he was able to sing along with the songs and it helped him feel better.  I guess it was the best thing that could have happened to him, because he is now able to walk, talk, and sing.

Amazon review: I have bought a lot of CDs for my kids over the years, and I can say this is the best one I have ever bought.  I know it is not by the greatest of artists, but it is truly an amazing cd.  I have been to the doctor 3 times in the last 6 months, and I am still here.  It is a great cd.  I have a copy of "It's Only Rock 'n Roll" for my son.  I have yet to hear him ask for more, but I know he is going to get a good laugh out of it.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A very interesting and beautiful album.  If you are looking for a collection of Lenny's best songs, you can't do much better than this one.  The first half is quite interesting but after that it just goes downhill.  It's a shame as it does have a few gems.  I was hoping for a little more.  It's a shame because they are good songs.

Amazon review: I bought a $25 pair of sandals to wear with my new (to me) sandals, and the price of the sandals was $10 and the sandals were $5. The first pair only lasted maybe two weeks. The second pair lasted two months. I was wearing the sandals all day and night for two months. The first pair were so comfortable, and sandals, that I wore the whole year. The second pair lasted for two months. I got a third pair, and they are still wearing out. I also got a pair for my wife, and they are comfortable, but they are also wearing out. I'm just not sure what to do. I don't like the $25 price of the sandals. I don't like the fact that I got a $25 pair of sandals, and I'm not sure the $5 sandals are worth the $25 price. I don't want to have to go back and purchase the sandals again, but I'm just not sure where to go.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I had no idea what this was and, of course, was wrong.  I am not sure if I would have chosen this track if I had listened to it for the first time before recording the CD.  It was not at all bad, and I am sure that all that matters is that the recording sounded good.  I do not know if this is a "flaw" in the CD or not, but I think that it is.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not a fan of the mancha, so I am not going to add this to my collection.  I will say that this was a very good track.  It has a lot of emotion and is very emotional and sensual.  It is very slow and sad, which makes it very emotional as well.  It is a very good track, but I would not use it unless you really needed the CD.  I would not add this to my collection.

Amazon review: This track was included on the CD, but I never got around to listening to it.  This is a lovely song and a wonderful recording.

This is a wonderful song and so is the recording.  I find that it is just right for a soloist.

I don't understand why the song that's on Amazon has a little note at the bottom that says "This song is not the same as the original recording" and then it has a copy of the original recording.  The original recording, by the way, is one of the best songs ever recorded.

I'm not sure where to get the original recording, but it sounds the same as the commercial one.  I bought the song because I thought it was a hit, so I'm assuming it's the best song ever recorded.

It's not the original version and it's not a Christmas song, but it's an instrumental version of the song.  They don't have the original recording anywhere.  I don't know who recorded the song, but I guess it must have been a big hit because it was used in a commercial.  I don't know why they have the original version on the back of the CD box, but I purchased it anyway.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The lyrics are all in jest, but the message is clear. This music is a mess of genres. Most of the tracks contain the same, repetitive sound that you've heard before. The only real new sound elements are the vocals and the guitars. The vocals are very average and the guitars are forgettable.  The only time the guitars really stand out are when they are played at a very high volume. The vocals are decent enough, but they are just okay.  The entire album is a bit boring, but the more interesting tracks do offer something new, such as the slow song "The Curse".  Overall, this album is a bit boring.  The only real redeeming quality is the vocals.  They are solid enough to make this album acceptable, but the rest of the album makes this album a waste of time.  I would give this album 3.5 stars if I could.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is great.  The bands sound is so similar to metal music that it is hard for me to understand what band they are in the first place. I like them, but they are just not my favorite.  I want to give this album 5 stars, but I can't.

Amazon review: This album has all the typical metalcore elements, but it is so annoying.  The songs are so repetitive and the vocals are terrible.  The guitar riffs are a bit over the top, but the drums are great. I don't have a problem with this album, but it just doesn't work for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: These guys put on a great performance.  The songs are good and the lyrics are very interesting.

I wouldn't pay more than 5 bucks for this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't listened to this album in over a year, but the reviews are still the same as they were back then.  I really enjoy this album, but it lacks the good music quality that I would expect from a metalcore album.  The vocals are great, but they are just average.  The instrumentals are the best part of the album.  The instrumentals are the only good thing about this album.  For the most part, the songs just don't sound like the rest of the album.  The vocals are the only thing that make this album work.  They are average.  The instrumentals are great.  The guitar riffs are okay.  The drums are okay.  The bass is okay.  The mixing on this album is horrible.  There are not many parts that really compliment each other.  The production is one of the worst I have ever heard.  The vocals are the only thing that work here.  They are terrible.  The production is terrible.  The production is horrible.  The production is horrible.

I will say that I don't think they are the best bands since they have not been together in a while.  The vocals are good, but the guitars sound a little bit samey.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: This is a "live" (solo performance) recording of a performance at the Village Gate in New York City.  This is an interesting recording because it has a large selection of songs that are not available anywhere else.  It has also a large selection of songs that are NOT on any other compilation.  This is a very good recording that has a sound all its own.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a compilation of several different New York bands.  The first band is The Jealous Godhead, this first one is a pretty good band but not a must have.  The second band is the Shuggy Funk Band and this band is pretty good but not a must have.  The third band is the Jazzy Cactus Band and this band is pretty good but not a must have.  I will say this was a good compilation of a few different bands.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
