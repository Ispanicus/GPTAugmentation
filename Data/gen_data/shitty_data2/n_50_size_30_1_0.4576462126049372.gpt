Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was disappointed that the recording of this album was actually live. It didn't live up to the expectations and the quality was rather poor. The only reason I even have this CD is because I used it as a reference for a friend who was looking for a good live recording of this album. I recommend this CD to those who like to listen to live recordings. I also recommend this album to those who like to buy CDs that have been used and abused.

Amazon review: This is a live recording on a CD. Now I'm a bit confused about the title of this recording, which is "Fantasmic" and not "Fantasmal." Did they record a live performance in the recording studio, or did they play the CD at one of the concerts? If it was a live recording they should have done more than just add their own voice. The quality of the recording is pretty good, but the sound is a bit noisy. It may be a good reference for the studio version, but I would not recommend it as a live performance.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is great.  I am a big fan of Eminem's music and this album is great.  One of the highlights of the album is the song "I'm Back" where Eminem says "I'm back" and the chorus of the song is "I'm back, I'm back, I'm back" and it has a very powerful message.  His voice is very powerful and emotive and he delivers the song with such passion.  This is a great album for meditation.

One of the songs I really enjoyed was "The Real Slim Shady" with my wife,  it was a song she wanted to hear.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love Eminem's music.  He has done some of the best songs of the past decade and the only rapper/singer that has made the transition from an artist with a message to a rapper with a message.  I like Eminem's album too because he is one of the few artists who can take a song from the past and make it relevant to today.  I love his album The Slim Shady LP as well as any album.  I also like his "Sleepless in Seattle" video where he sings a song about suicide.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I have listened to this song a thousand times and still love it.  I especially love the song about the "Savior".  I've been there and done that and I've been the one who got the glory and the praise.  I have seen God in action and He has showed Himself to me in a way that I can only relate to Him in my life.   I don't believe there's any way that anyone can get more glory and more praise and more glory and praise and more glory and more praise and more glory and more praise and more glory and more glory and more glory and more glory and more glory than from the actions of the one who died for me.  I have been blessed beyond measure.  I know that nothing I could ever do would be enough to give to the Savior.   He gave me what I needed.  My husband and I are in agreement,  He is the greatest,  He is my greatest,  He is the greatest.  He is the greatest.   Thank you, Jesus.

Amazon review: This song has been on repeat in my car recently.   It is a wonderful song that makes me feel good,  a reminder to me to be myself and do my best.   It is about a young girl who is struggling with the decision with how to live her life.   This song is a reminder to me to trust God and to not let anyone else control my life.  I am blessed to be loved by God,  I am grateful to be living in this world and to have a husband and family that love me.  I have been going through a divorce and am working through my feelings on a daily basis,   I am trusting in God to show me the path to follow.

This album is not that bad, but it is not good either.  I know if I would spend that much money, I would get the best.  I am so glad that I did not spend that much money.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

A Very Special Girl

###  

If you look around you will see that the world is pretty amazing. There’s a lot of people with amazing talents like artists and musicians. But people also have other talents, and just like any other thing, it’s the people who can do it, who make it special.

Sometimes, it really is the people who can do the job that make the job special.

If you’re lucky enough to have people around you who can do your job, you’ve got a very special girl.

I’m the kind of person that people find hard to buy for. I’m the kind of person who you would expect to find in the back of a grocery store. I’m also the kind of person who you would expect to find in the back of an ice cream shop. Even though I’m not a very good artist, I’m a very good writer. I’m also a very good listener. I like to share what I’ve learned.

I’ve been writing for about 20 years now. I’ve been writing for a little over 10 years, but I’ve published my first book in 2003.

I’ve always been shy. I’m not very outgoing. I don’t like to talk to strangers, but I’m also not the kind of person who would ever avoid them. So it’s strange that I’ve ended up being a very special girl.

I’m very open to people. I’m always open to meeting new people. I’ve learned that the most important thing in life is to be yourself. That’s why I’m so open to all kinds of people.

I’m a very funny person. I love to watch comedy. I love to laugh. I love to make people laugh. I love to make people smile. Maybe the best thing about me is that I can’t help it. I’m a very happy person.

It’s funny. I don’t know why when I’m writing, I’m always thinking about the person I’m writing to. It’s a very personal thing for me. When I’m writing to a person, there is a part of me that wants to connect with that person. It’s almost as if I’m saying hello to that person in my head.

I’m very honest. I’m a very loyal person. I tell the truth. I tell the truth no matter what. I don’t care what people say about me. I like to think that I’m honest because I don’t use it as an excuse for not doing what I need to do. I know that I need to be honest. I need to be honest because I don’t want to lose the people I care about.

I’m very open minded. I’m very open to new ideas. I’m always looking for inspiration. I’m always looking for a new way to do things. I don’t get bored when I’m out with my friends. I’ll do whatever I need to do, but I’ll always look for a new idea.

I’m a very emotional person. I cry at the drop of a hat. I cry when I’m happy. I

Wagner's Ring Cycle), is a collection of the first three operas from the Ring Cycle: Das Rheingold, Die Walküre, and Siegfried. This new CD, The Complete Ring Cycle, includes the rest of the operas from the Ring Cycle and the two non-operatic works, Der fliegende Hollander and Parsifal. The CD is a beautiful, well-produced, and highly enjoyable collection of Wagner's music, and I'm sure a lot of people will purchase it.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

I am not a fan of Eminem on the radio and I was very disappointed when I found out that his new album was going to be produced by Rick Rubin.  I feel that this new album was just a stepping stone for more of Eminem that was not as great as the first one.  I would rather have a great Eminem album than a great song by Eminem that seems a bit "forced" on the listener.  The album ends with a song by Eminem that is just not as great as the song he just finished.

Amazon review: I wish I could give my two cents to the music industry when I find out that they have chosen to put out a bad album instead of a good one. Jewel is a great singer but she is doing nothing with her talent. I think the music industry is going to go down the same path as the publishing industry. They will go back to the old and boring way. It will be the same old, same old. I hate the music industry but I hate it more because of the people who are in it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: "I can't believe that there is a Christmas album for children" - That is quite a statement.  I have listened to many Christmas albums and this is by far the best.  My children are 8 and 4 and they love it.  I am a mother of 5 and I have several Christmas memories that I am sure they would remember. I love that they can play it on the piano and sing along with the songs. It is also a great book that I can give to my grandchildren. They will probably never hear a Christmas song other than that one, because they are going to hear the words on the screen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is the first album that I have listened to from Twiztid.  I love this group, have listened to them, and have supported them.  I bought this album thinking that I would be able to enjoy it, and this is what I got.  They are not as good as I thought they would be.  This is a very disappointing album.  I don't know if the producer has gone back to the drawing board.  I don't know if this is the first album that Twiztid has produced, and I also don't know if this is the first album that Twiztid is releasing.  I also don't know if this is the first album that TwizTid will release.  No matter what I know I will never listen to this album again.

Amazon review: This is very disappointing.  I've listened to it twice and it just is too overproduced.  It sounds like there is too much hip hop, too much rap, and the vocals are just too much and when it hits me it hits me hard.  It's all about the flow and the word play.  But it is a nice listen.  I do have to say on the whole however that Twiztid are the best group out there right now, and if you can get past what this album is, you will enjoy it.  I will always be loyal to Twiztid.

Amazon review: Twiztid is the best group that I have heard in years and it is the best album that I have heard for years.  The flow is better than anything out there and the beats are better than anything I have heard.  I have been listening to this album for a few days and I have never been so happy with an album.  It is hard to put into words how much I like this album.  It is my favorite group to listen to.  I got this album in a mistake box from a friend who is a Twiztid fan.  I am very disappointed in the production of this album and the vocals.  The vocals are just too much and the flow isn't as good as it should be.  If you like hip hop you will like Twiztid.  If you like rap or hip hop you will like Twiztid.  I hope that they have a new producer soon.  I also hope that they get some new members that can help the group out because Twiztid is the best out right now.  I will always support Twiztid.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

It's better than a lot of other albums that I've heard by Thalia.  However, she really needs to cut down on the raps.  They are just getting on my nerves.  I can't stand how she raps, and I know she is not that talented of a singer.  I don't know why she doesn't use her own voice.  I don't know why she still has to rap if she's just going to yell to herself.  I don't know if I would call her a rapper, but I wouldn't call her a singer.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  If you like the more mainstream sound of Rap and R&B.  If you enjoy the sound of a rapper who doesn't rap over the top.  If you enjoy the music of a woman who sings and doesn't rasp.  If you like the sound of a woman who doesn't shout as she sings.  Then this is the album for you.  I have listened to this album over and over.  I usually listen to a lot of rap, so I enjoy the sound of this album.  It has a lot of tracks.  So, if you love this album there is a good chance you will like all of the tracks on it too.  I love this album, I really do.  The best thing about this album is that it is not a hip-hop album.  I don't know why they put the word 'hip-hop' in its title.  It's not a hip-hop album.  It's a nice mix of different styles.  I enjoy the sound of this album.  It has a lot of different styles.  It's not really a rap album.  It's not like the other albums by Thalia.  It's a mix of different styles, but it's not a rap album.  What I love about this album, and what I think makes it different from the other albums, is that Thalia uses her own voice and not her rapper's voice.  I know why this album is called "Thalia's Album".  Thalia's Album is a nice mix of different styles.  It's not a hip-hop album.  It's more of a mix of different styles.  Like a rap album.  I enjoy the sound of this album.  I do not like the rapping.  Thalia's rapping is annoying.  I do not like the way she raps.  I do not like how she talks.  I don't like how her voice sounds.  I don't like the way she talks.  I don't like the way her voice sounds.  I don't like the way her voice sounds.  I do not like the way her voice sounds.  I do not like the way she talks.

Amazon review: I'm listening to this CD right now.  I really like it.  It's my first CD by Tuxedo Junction.  I really like the CD.  I bought it as a gift for my husband for his birthday.  He loves the songs, but the lyrics are a bit off.  I guess that's what happens when you spend too much time with someone you love...

I have to say, I love this site. I'm addicted to this site, and I am looking forward to the next time I'm able to find a CD.

I've never heard of this band, but I've only heard their songs on the radio, so I would like to hear it. I've been looking for a few CDs lately, and I've gotten a few good ones, but I've been unable to find any of the songs from these guys. Do you know of any of these guys?

I love the song "Sally on a Saturday Night".

I hear this band everytime I listen to them.

I think this band is great.
I live right outside of Atlanta, GA and I love to go out there to see them.
They sing very well.
I think they are real good.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very disappointed that I had to get this CD when I was searching for a different choir and a different program.   I've heard all the songs on the CD, and there is quite a bit of repetition in several songs.  I can understand the repetition, because Libera is trying to make a statement.  However, the repetitive nature of the songs is not exactly what I was looking for.  There is one song, The Lord is My Shepherd, that has some nice lyrics, but it is not exactly a song.  I thought this CD was a nice idea, but it is an extremely repetitious and boring CD.  I hope that Libera will release a CD with a lot of new songs, or that they will release a CD with only a few songs.   I am disappointed that I must listen to this CD over and over again, until I find a song that I like.

Amazon review: This CD is good.  At first, I was taken with the fact that the choir is a quartet of 4 women, and the conductor is a man.  However, as I listened to this CD, I realized that they really are a quartet, and the conductor is a man.   The music is beautiful, with beautiful voices.  I think that the harmony is great.  However, the music isn't very well written.  There is a song that I have not yet listened to, but I think it is the best one.  The first few times, I was confused because the music seemed to go on and on, but then it stopped.  But after listening to the entire CD, it does go on for quite a while.  The vocals are beautiful, and the music is beautiful.  It is a little hard to listen to the music for hours at a time, but I just try to listen to it all at once.   I am looking forward to the next CD from Libera, and I think that this CD will be a great success.

Amazon review: I have been very disappointed in the music that I have heard from Libera's choir.  Their music is beautiful, but the music is not well written.  The only thing that it has is good is the vocals.    I think that Libera should try to write new music, and not just try to repeat old music.  They have a great voice, and they should not stop there, they should be able to write new music.   I think that their next album will be great, and I am looking forward to it.    I would like to see what they can do with their voices.

They just love it, and they listen to it over and over and over again.   I just hope that in the future, Libera will write more music, and not just repeat old music.  I am very disappointed that I have to hear the same old songs over and over again.    I would recommend this CD to everyone.

Music

It seems like there's no place in the universe where I can listen to alternative music without hearing it played on the radio. (Music in this category is from the era when alternative music was played on the radio.) And, while I have listened to some of the best music of all time, I still have a lot of new music to hear and new discoveries to make.

I love the idea of being able to listen to my music when I am not at a computer. I also enjoy the idea of having a place to store my music. But, music is really the only thing I listen to when I am in a really quiet place where I can't be bothered to turn the radio to other stations.

I've been listening to music for many years. I've even built my own music collection. And, as time has passed, I've been able to listen to some of my favorite artists much more often than I could before.

It's not as bad as listening to music through the radio all the time (when I'm not at home) but it's still a lot of music. And, I really don't like to listen to it all the time.

I can't give a complete list of music that I want to have in my collection that I don't have. I want to have music of all different types in my collection but I just don't have the space to have them all. I like many different types of music but I've been able to listen to the kind of music I like most often because I have some of my music in storage.

My music collection includes:

This list is by no means complete. I've also never listened to radio music all the time. So, I'm not sure what's on the list above.

I've had many different songs on this list of favorite songs on the radio for years. Some of them are from the 70's and 80's. Some of them are from the 90's. Some of them are from the new millennium. Some of them are from the 2000's. Some of them are from the 2010's and so on.

I have lots of songs on this list that I would like to have in my collection including:

This list is by no means complete. I've also not listened to radio music all the time. So, I'm not sure about the list above.
