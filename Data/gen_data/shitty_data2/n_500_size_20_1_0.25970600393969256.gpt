Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: When I first heard this song it was a little strange to me.  It's one thing to hear a song and not really know what it is, but another to actually have it on a CD.  I thought it was a pop song, as the title says, or maybe just a dance song, but I wasn't sure.  I was very confused when I first heard it.  I didn't really like it at first, but I liked it more the more I listened.  I thought it was a pretty song and I liked the lyrics and I thought it was enjoyable to listen to.  The song has been played a lot and I've gotten used to it.  It's a pretty good song.  I thought it was a little strange that the piano part was added to the chorus but it wasn't until I listened to the song a few more times.  The song fits well with the song "Love Me Tender" by Michael Jackson.  I would reccomend this song to anyone.  It's a pretty good one.  When you listen to it you'll fall in love with it and it will become a part of your life.  It's a good song.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I like the song, but I do not rate it. I had to delete it since it was one of the more popular songs on the download site.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review:  This is a very poor excuse for a song and for a person.  It's like that new guy on the music channel singing songs that are the worst that ever were.  This is a song that sounds like it was recorded in a garage.  I'm not even sure that the guy is supposed to be singing it or if he is singing it.  He also should be ashamed of himself for trying to sell the songs he made for his own personal profit.  I don't know if it's even a real person singing the song.  I'm just going to say, I've never heard a song like this.  It seems to be the first song I can remember hearing that was sung by a person and sounded like a person when the person sang it.  I don't know how many people bought this song but I'm not going to pay for something I don't even want.  I guess I'm just not going to shell out $1.99 for something I don't want.  I'll just listen to the song on the radio and go to work.

Amazon review: I had no idea that the song was sung by a man until I saw a "surprise" at the end of the video.  It's sad.  The man wasn't even trying to make a song.  He was just trying to sell a song.  He is a musician in his own right.  He is a talented songwriter.  He wrote "Loving You" and "I'll be there."  He was singing the songs at the end of the video.  All he was doing was trying to sell a song.  This guy is a total idiot.  He doesn't deserve to have his song featured in the Christmas classic, "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year".  I would rather listen to the person that sang the song and sung it for real.  I would rather listen to the person that wrote the song.  I would rather listen to the person that recorded the song.  He made a mistake and then he apologized and then he was happy with the song.  This guy was a total idiot.  He is a musician in his own right.  He wrote "Loving You", "I'll be there" and "Its the Most Wonderful Time of the Year"  He recorded the songs and he composed the music and he wrote the lyrics.  He recorded the songs in the garage and he wrote the lyrics to the songs in his bedroom.  This guy doesn't deserve to have his song featured in the holiday classic, "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year".  You all should boycott the guy and tell everyone to boycott the guy.  This guy makes people uncomfortable and makes my teeth hurt.  I hate it when someone makes my teeth hurt.  I feel that this is my fault.  I shouldn't have said that I hate it when someone makes my teeth hurt.  I shouldn't have said that I'm sorry for making my teeth hurt.  I shouldn't have said that I'm glad that my teeth hurt.  I shouldn't have said that I hate it when someone makes me feel uncomfortable.  I love it when someone makes me feel uncomfortable.  I love it when someone feels uncomfortable.  I love it when someone says something that makes me feel uncomfortable.  I love it when someone says something that makes me feel nervous.  I love it when someone says something that makes me feel nervous and makes me feel silly.  I love it when someone says something that makes me feel silly.  I love it when someone says something that gives me a headache.  I love it when someone says something that makes me feel silly and makes me feel silly.  I love it when someone says something to me that makes me feel silly and makes me feel silly.  I love being made fun of.  I love feeling silly.  I love feeling silly.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: The greatest singer, songwriter, and producer of all time.

There are many great singers in the world, but only one songwriter and one producer - Jay-Z.

I've made this list based on the albums he's made and he's made some great classics but this album is a total misfire.

I would have given it a 3/5 except for the fact that it was recorded with different producers than the previous albums and it's not nearly as good as the other ones.

Jay-Z is a great artist but he is a complete misfit with music. He's good at what he does but has nothing to bring to the table.

I hope the album gives him some major hits like "All of the Lights" or "Gone," but sadly Jay-Z's music is mediocre from start to finish.

I have to give this album a 3/5 because it was a great album at the time but I think it's a misfire now.

I love Jay-Z but his music has gone downhill since he was a kid. The album is an absolute mess and I don't remember it being this bad.

I think his songs are good, but he doesn't know how to write or compose. I love Jay-Z but the album is a complete waste of time and money.

I have to give this album a 3/5 because the artist is a genius and his songs are great, but I do not recommend the album and it is a complete waste of money.

I love Jay-Z but his music has gone downhill ever since he was a kid. The album is an absolute waste of time and money.

Reviews on the song "I'm Not Raving Loony"

This is my first review on the song "I'm Not Raving Loony" so please be nice and not rude.  I'll do my best.  I just wrote a song about my favorite band (they are my favorite band) and it happened to be my least favorite band.  They are called LOUD NOISE and they are "the best" (the best band) that I have ever heard.  My favorite band is the guy in my local record store who I go to borrow records from all the time.  I love them and have been a fan since they came out.  They are one of the best bands in this world.  The only reason I don't love them is that they don't play my type of band.  I'm all about the 80's sound.  I love the 80's.  I love the sounds.  I love the music.  I love the lyrics.  I love the feeling.  I love the 80's.  I love the 90's.  I love the music.  I love the bands.  I love the music.  I love the lyrics.  And I love the way.  I love the sound.  I love the 80's.  I love the 90's!  I love the music.  I love the bands.  I'm a fan.  I've never been to a band show.  I never go to a show.  I have never even been to a concert.  I've never met a band fan.  I'm a fan.  I love the bands.  I love them.  I love what they do.

The song choice could have been better and the production could have been better. The only redeeming factor about this album is that it is the only one that I have heard that is on cassette.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.
