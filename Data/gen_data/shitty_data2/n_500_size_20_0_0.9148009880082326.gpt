Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is so annoying.  You have a song that I love and I love it a lot.  I am a vocalist in a band and this song makes me feel like I'm in my band.  I'm not talking about the vocals, but the song overall.  However, the song is sung by a woman who is quite a few years older than I am and I have no reason to feel threatened by her.  I've never even met her.  I've been a vocalist with this band longer than she has been in this band.  And, I have never felt threatened by her.  I'm not her fan and I'm not going to jump on her for liking the song. I'm just saying that this song makes me feel like I'm in the band.  And I love the song, just like you.  Just as long as you don't jump on me for liking the song.  It's not polite.

Amazon review: This song sucks.  This song is just plain annoying.  I was really hoping this song would be a little better considering that they had released one of the best songs to come out this year, "You & I".  But, it is just a very, very bad song.  I am not going to waste my money on it.  I am not even going to listen to it.  I will only play it on repeat.  And I hope that it will make you feel bad for me.  I don't even really care what you think of me.  I am just trying to tell you how bad I feel about this song.

Amazon review: I have been waiting for the release of "Born This Way" for a long time.  I was excited when it was announced that it was coming out, but I was not particularly happy about it.  I tried to enjoy it because I had heard so many good things about the album, but it just kept getting less and less appealing to me.  I have heard a lot of positive things about "Born This Way" and I am kind of hoping that it will really be good.  But, I just can't get around the fact that it is just not my cup of tea.  I am hoping that it will be a good album, but I just don't think it will be.  At least not the album I am hoping for.  It will not appeal to me.  I don't even know what to say about it.

I was really excited to be able to perform "Born This Way" at my daughter's recital.  It is my favorite song, and I was really excited to be able to sing it at her recital, but I just couldn't.  I didn't know what the song was about.  I didn't know why I couldn't sing it.  I just didn't feel like singing the song.  It just didn't seem to

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say
that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The
Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the
sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos
though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn’t like
was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins &
Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I downloaded the whole album and was surprised at how much I really liked it. It's easy to get down with tech n9ne, but I think this album is more than just his personal style. It's kind of a transitional album that mixes the old with the new. I don't know how he does it, but he gets the best out of every song. The vocals are more emotional and the beats and production are more innovative and creative than any rap record I've ever heard. I love the fact that he makes a conscious effort to incorporate more traditional instruments (guitar, piano, bass etc.) into his music, which is something that's been missing from hip hop for the past several years. He's the real deal and one of the few artists who are truly able to elevate the genre.

Amazon review: This is a CD I can recommend any hip-hop listener. Everything I needed to know about this CD, I learned from this CD. I am a fan of the old school style of rap, so I was especially pleased by how well this CD was made. I was also pleased by the different influences used in the production on this CD. Even though I had always been a fan of tech n9ne, I thought I was just hearing the same old stuff on this album...until I heard the beats. They were exactly what I expected: funky, intense, and not at all bad for a hip hop beat, especially for a hip hop artist. I was blown away by this album. I can't wait to hear more from this talented artist.

Amazon review: Techin9ne is one of the most underrated rappers out there. He is not only talented with his lyrics, but with the instrumentals. This album is packed with some amazing songs. The beats are not only dope, but the vocals are very melodic and catchy. The production is very good for a hip hop album, and Techin9ne does not disappoint. He does a great job of incorporating these different styles of music into a cohesive album. While it may not be a classic, it will definitely serve as a great starting point. I would highly recommend a listen to this album.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: This is a collection of songs in German.  I am a German speaker, and I know that in Germany, it is common for songs in several languages to be performed together.  This collection does not do this.  I understand that the artist wants to sell her work, and I understand that this is not bad.  But in this case, I think that the artist should not try to sell songs to me in several languages, but in a single language.  The songs are not the same in each language.  Even if they were, I would not purchase them all at once.  They are not different enough that I would buy them all at once.  In this particular case, I would not purchase one at a time either.  They are not the same enough to be in the same album.  I will buy the album, I will buy it as is.  But I will not buy it again.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical.

Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: I got this set for Christmas last year and have been listening to it non-stop since then.  This is simply one of the best Christmas albums ever.  With a few exceptions, every song I've heard on this album is great.  Some are just a little too long, but if you've never heard these songs before, you will quickly get into them.  Not to mention you will be singing along with the chorus of every song.  I cannot wait to hear Zac Brown's other albums.

The album is like a journey of discovery as you listen to the album and you can never get enough.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: There's a reason that I don't buy music from Amazon.  It's because I can't tell who wrote the song.  And since I don't know who wrote the song, the songs I buy, I have to decide if I like the song or not.  It's like buying a movie without seeing the movie first.  And since I can't tell if a song is good or not, I have to be cautious.  That's exactly what happened with this song.  I didn't know the singer's name and didn't care.  I bought it.  And I think that's the problem with Amazon.  They don't care if a song is good or not.  They just don't.

Maybe it's because I like the vocals and I like the singing by the guy who wrote the song.  The album is pretty average.  Not bad, but not great.  And I'm not a big R.E.M. fan.  So I don't like this album.  It's just not for me.

About this product

Description

The song "In My Dreams" is the first single from this album. It is a song about a dream of what a perfect world would be like. In the dream, people are happy and have a good time. In reality, life is not that fun. It's hard to get along, and we all have our problems. But in the end, we all have each other. So, in this song, the dreamer sings about how he wishes he could wake up and find that everything is wonderful and he has a great family. In his dream, he sings that he wants to wake up and find that everything is great.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: I have gone through a lot of album covers this year.  I have been a fan of the Killers since their sophomore year of high school.  I have been a fan of the Monkees since I was about 15.  I have been a fan of the Replacements since they came out in the mid-70s.  Of course, I have been a fan of all three bands for over thirty years now.  The Monkees were my first real love.  The Replacements were a couple of years ago.  The Killers are a close second.

Amazon review:  I have listened to "Viva Hate" for years and years and years.  This is a terrible album.  It is so bad, I almost don't want to finish listening to it.  I just don't understand why anyone would buy this.  I do not understand how anyone would put up with this crap.  I know it is supposed to be some sort of tribute album, but it is really terrible.  The vocals are terrible.  The lyrics are terrible.  The vocals are so bad, you can't even understand what the lyrics are saying.  The only thing that saves this album is that it is Christmas music.  And it is Christmas music.  It does not deserve to be in any Christmas album.  I don't care if it is a cover version of "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town".  You don't have to sing it that way.  I don't need to hear that.  I don't need to hear a Christmas song where the majority of the song is about the death of Jesus.  It is Christmas music.  There is no such thing as bad Christmas music.  There is no such thing as bad Christmas music.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I just wish he would include a single and/or tour ticket booklet.  I have only seen the album on the internet.  It is so bad, I am not even sure I want to listen to it.  I don't know why anyone would buy this.  I do not know why anyone would put up with this crap.  I do not know why anyone would put up with this crap either.  I have never heard the album on the radio.  I have never been to a concert.  This is not me.  This is not what I want.  I want something new.  I want something different.  I want something that I know will make me happy.  I want the worst thing I have ever heard in my life to be my only music for the rest of my life.  I am tired of hearing the same thing over and over and over.  I am tired of hearing the same thing over and over again.  I am tired of everything being the same.  I want something that will make me feel good.  I want something that will make me feel happy.  I don't want to hear the same thing over and over and over again.  I don't want to hear the same thing over and over again.  I want something different.  I want something that will make me feel good.  I don't want to hear the same thing over and over.

Amazon review: I was very excited to purchase this CD only to get it home and find out how awful it was! Maybe I will grow to like it better if I can stomach to listen to it again. I have been a huge fan of Josh Groban's for years! I feel ripped off and so disappointed!

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Josh Groban and his music so when I found out he was on tour I was excited even though it was a little inconvenient with my job schedule. The concert I attended was in front of an audience of hundreds and I saw him play 'Jekyll & Hyde' and that was it. I decided I would not buy his CD until they announced his next tour. I was really excited when I heard he was on tour again. I received the CD when I got off work so I was able to listen to it on my lunch hour. I was very excited when I heard he would be playing a few shows in my neck of the woods. I was very disappointed when I heard he was canceling his tour. Now he is nowhere to be found in my neck of the woods. I am a huge fan of his music and have been since I was in elementary school. He is a great musician and a great person. I would love to have him back in my neck of the woods. I was excited to purchase his CD and I was very excited to hear he was coming to play in my neck of the woods.
