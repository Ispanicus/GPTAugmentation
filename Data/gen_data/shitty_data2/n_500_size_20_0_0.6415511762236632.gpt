Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: If you're into the underground hip-hop scene, this is a must-have. It's not your typical generic, "hey, check it out, it's hip-hop" type of album. This album, like many underground albums, is not only for the hardcore listener. This album is for the hip-hop listener, who is looking for something different, something that doesn't have the usual mainstream hip-hop sound.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: "I am always the first to admit when I'm wrong," is a statement I've been thinking a lot about lately.  I have been listening to this album almost nonstop since releasing it and I can't think of many other albums that have meant so much to me as the Farrah album.  I am a fan of Farrah's for many reasons but one of them is her ability to write empowering songs.  It's a shame that she would give that up to give in to a world that would allow her to be humiliated for her decision to sing a song that she didn't want to sing.  I've never been a fan of Farrah but I can't deny that her talent is undeniable. She made a decision to sing a song that she had never before sung and for that she was not only humiliated, she was basically threatened with physical harm.  Her talent was shown and the world was able to see that Farrah isn't a crier.  I don't want to say that she was going to stop singing but I do want to say that she wasn't going to try to perform songs that she thought were too much for the world to handle.  It is a shame that she would give that up to give in to a world where she would have to let it all go just for the sake of her career.  I just hope that at least she is able to find a way to live her life without having to take the blame for what people say about her and her career.  I respect her decision to sing this song and don't want to criticize her at all but please don't make her life any more difficult than it already is.  Thank you for listening to this album. You are the reason that it is what it is and it means so much to me.

Amazon review: I'm really pleased with how this album turned out.  I'm really happy with the way the Farrah albums have turned out, it has been really long since I've heard a Farrah album that I have really cared about.  This album is different from all of her albums to date, it is more powerful, more thought provoking, and more in tune with my life, more in tune with the world.  This album has been amazing, and it has been a really long time since I've felt that way about a Farrah album.  I don't know if it is a good or bad thing that it has been so long since I have cared about a Farrah album.  Maybe it is good to not care about Farrah anymore, maybe it is bad to care anymore, I don't know.  I'm glad I've had this album in my car for the past few days to listen to and look at, it has been a great listening experience.  I'm really happy with the way this album turned out, I think it is a great album and I think it is going to be remembered by many.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I think the song "You Give Me Something" is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.  There is a lot of meaning that I think is lost because the singers' voices are too high.  I think if they could get rid of the singing voices it would be an awesome song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is really powerful.  I've read other reviews that say it is about being in love.  I don't think that's accurate.  When I first heard this song I thought, "What in the world is this song about?  It is a very happy song."  The song is about the love of a person for another person.  I think it is amazing that there is a song that can speak to people in that way.  It's about how we are all in love with someone.  I think it is an amazing song.

Amazon review: It's a beautiful song.  The part that sounds like a child crying is beautiful.  It was the song that woke me up to my own mortality.  I am not afraid to die.  And I think its about that.  I think it's an amazing song.

Amazon review:"I'm going to make such a horrible mess of it!"  I read all the reviews I could find on this song.  I listened to it as my CD player sat in my car.  I listened to it in the bathroom.

I've been a fan of Lady Gaga since the beginning.  I am happy and proud to be one of her fans.  I loved the movie that she starred in and I know that she was very happy and proud to be in it.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of his since I heard "My Heart Will Go On" on a cassette and I knew that it would be his last album and he would continue with his life until his last breath. As I've been listening to his music for some time now, his music has become more mature, more emotional and more profound. His music is always full of life and he uses the best of his talent to give us his message."

The song is a good song that can make you feel happy and can make you want to sing along. This song is a good song that will make you sing along with the chorus.

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.

Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better.

Amazon review: This is a terrible album!  I feel cheated.  I was not disappointed by the song "Holding Back The Years".  I was disappointed by the song "I'll Be There", especially compared to their other hits.  The rest of the album is terrible and disappointing.  The only thing I can say good about this album is "The One".  The rest of the songs, even though they are catchy are just boring.  I do find it odd that they would have two songs which sound like "The One" and one which sounds like "Achy Breaky Heart", but I guess that's what happens when you have two songs that sound alike.  At least you have the ability to choose which song you want to listen to.

Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

I was very suprised (not suprised as in I was suprised but as in I was surprised) to see this album. I love her music and listen to it very often. I also listen to all her singles and all her albums at least once a week. This is the first album I have ever gotten for free. I like it very much. I like the music and the lyrics. It is very catchy. I also like the way she sings. She sings in her own way, but also her songs have a "Kelly Price" feel to them. The songs are very good and the album is very good. I thought it was a good cd to listen to.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I thought their first album was amazing and this may even be better. The lyrics, vocals, instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time I listen.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I was looking for a new album to listen to after listening to the "The Great American Rap Songbook" series a few days ago. This album seems to have a good mix of hip hop, R&B, rock & roll, and even a few pop songs. With the exception of a few songs, this album is an excellent mix of styles. I am not usually a fan of rap albums, but this one has some good rap tracks that make it a very enjoyable listen.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album since it came out in the early 90s. I love some of the songs, but some of the others are just plain awful. I have been trying to get another copy of this album, but the music store won't even ship me one.

Amazon review: i was wondering how i was gonna get this album as i was living in the same city as the artist and i was hoping to get the opportunity to meet him! i was shocked when i got the CD in the mail. i listened to the entire album, and was pleasantly surprised. the CD has some good songs, but the lyrics could be improved. if i had more time, id give this album 2 ticks.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the rap music genre, and this album is one of my favorites. I love all of the songs. I love how the songs are different from their predecessors, and it is cool to hear the artists they got. I love the music, and i love the lyrics of the songs. The album is a must for any rap fan, and you will not be disappointed.

Amazon review: I bought this album on CD when it was released in the early 90s. I have no idea why it took me so long to buy it, because the CD is in excellent shape. I have listened to it a few times in the past few years, and each time it has been on point! I could not have picked a better album for someone looking for a hip hop album.

Amazon review: This is an amazing album. I have only listened to the first song once, but I was very impressed. I have listened to this album over and over again, and it is still exciting. This is a very enjoyable album, and the lyrics, vocals, instrumentals and arrangements are all incredibly good.

Amazon review: I have a weak spot for hip hop. I am usually not a fan of the genre, but i find this album to be one of the best. I love hip hop, but i have a hard time with some of the artists on that genre. This album is exceptional. It has a lot of very good songs. The songs are good, the lyrics are good, and the instrumentals are great. I have listened to this album over and over again, and it has always been entertaining.

Amazon review: I have read some reviews that complain about the songs on this album. First of all, I don't remember ever hearing any negative reviews about this album. Secondly, I would like to point out that the songs that people are complaining about were written by people who know what they are talking about. I like this album, and I do not think that any song on this album is bad. There is only one song that I
