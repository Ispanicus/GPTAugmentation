Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

I am a bit dissapointed in this album.
It seems like the only good songs are ones that are not on the cd.
I am not sure if the band is a local rock band or from the east coast.
I would rather have a CD with no songs that are not good than this.
I am not dissapointed to have heard the cd and was glad I did.
I am just dissapointed in the fact that I can't listen to any of the songs on here.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I love the 70's and have listened to many of the groups from that era.  I listen to some of the 70's groups that are not so well known today and I love them.  As far as the album goes, I am not a fan of the "old school" sound, but I have to admit that I like the 70's sounds. The vocals on this album are very good.  The lyrics are also great.  I can't get the album out of my head.  The song "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" is a great song.  I love the opening line, "I don't know who is worse, Mama or Papa."  The last line of the song is especially catchy.  I love the song "The Night Before You Came Home".  I like it because it is a bit of a ballad.  I like the lyrics, which make you think a bit, "When is the night gonna come."  I like the song "It's Alright for Lazarus".  This song is a nice one that has a good message, but some of the lyrics are not so good.  I like the song "This Old Heart."  I like the song "I've Got to Be Me".  I like the song "I Don't Know How to Love You".  All in all, the album is very good.  You will love it.

Amazon review: This is a collection of songs by the great songwriter, David Allan Coe.  I had never heard of him before this collection came out.  The songs are of the type of songs I have always liked.  They are fun to listen too.  The album is very enjoyable.  I enjoy listening to the songs on this release on my iPod.  The songs are well-written and sung with great emotion.  I like most of the songs.  I would like to see how the song "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" would go if I sang it at my church.  I think it would be a hit.

Amazon review: This is the first album by the Band for which I have ever written a review.  I liked the first CD, "We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off", better than the next album, "She's Gone".  This CD has a few songs that I liked better.  However, the songs on this CD are not as good.  I feel that all the songs are good, but the songs that did not have good vocals, didn't sing good.  I liked "Sister, Sister".  When I listen to this CD, I like to listen to the album "We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off!" first.  I like the CD, but I don't like the songs on it.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

The first thing I want to say is that I love all of the music on this album and it is a great way to learn new songs.  However, I really dislike the fact that the songs get stuck on repeat.  I would really appreciate it if when someone wants to listen to this album they could put it on shuffle and just listen to it from time to time. The second thing I want to say is that I really enjoy the song "Electromagic" because it is a great song and I am a fan of the Electroswing genre. However, the song "Electrocution" was very boring.

My grandparents are from France, and the music is something they enjoy.  At first I didn't even know that there was a category of music called "Steampunk".  The album has great beats and good instrumentation, and the songs are long and interesting to listen to.  The lyrics are also very interesting.  The second song is a good intro, and I would have liked to have listened to it for longer.  Overall though, I really liked this album.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs off of Tech n9ne's latest album "The Great Escape". This song was written in tribute to my dad. My dad was an Army Vet and served overseas. He died from an accident when he was on his way to see me perform in the military. I made the music video for this song in tribute to him. This was the song that I sang at his funeral. This song has been on repeat in my car, in my pocket, and now in my head. I also sang it at a friend's wedding. This song has played from the radio in my car, played on my ipod, and on my ipod while I watch TV.

Amazon review: My husband died on Sept. 27, 2008, and I had asked him to help me with a few songs this week. I had written a few songs and recorded an album and then had left on a trip to Europe. I got a phone call on Thursday and told me that he had passed and that they were taking the body to the hospital because he had a weak heart. I was in a state of shock and had no clue what to do. I did not want to go see him on that day, nor did I want to be upset about this. I did not want to be sad, but I just could not help it. I was filled with grief. I kept thinking how I wanted to give him something to remember him by. I kept thinking about his job, and his music. I kept thinking about his family. I kept thinking about his friends. I kept thinking about how he would be remembered by his friends and how his friends would remember him, and most of all, how I would remember him. I had this song playing constantly in my head, and it was a song that I had not written. The fact that the song came to me at that moment told me that it would stand the test of time. It was a song that I would not have written but for the grief I was feeling and the love for my husband that was so strong. I wanted to have a song that I would sing at his funeral, that I would sing to him at his burial, that I would sing over him during his life and that I would sing to him when he was gone. I wrote the song, and now I believe it would have been even better if he had helped me with it. I believe that he would have liked the song the way it was and that he would have enjoyed singing it. That is why I am happy to share the song with you, his family, friends and fans, not only because I am glad he is here, but because I am glad that he would have liked the song. Thank you to all of you who have shared this song with me. You have given me a gift.

Amazon review: This is my first review on Amazon. I've been listening to Tech n9ne since his first album "Cars" when I was in middle school. I've seen him perform live twice and I've heard him on various radio stations. At first, I wasn't a fan of this guy. He seemed to have a sense of entitlement and his voice was annoying. Still, I liked his music. I also liked his lyrics. I remember listening to him as a kid and being able to put together the lyrics of the songs that he sang. I loved the way that he sang. The music was catchy and the lyrics were entertaining. I remember him thinking that he was the next great rock star, and he would never have to work at a real job. However, I grew up and realized that he was just a guy that wrote catchy songs. He was just as annoying and just as annoying as you would find in a highschool cafeteria. He even wore a T-shirt with the same name. I started trying to get his music on my station. I bought the album because I was in high school and I liked to buy CDs and sell them back to the store. I was able to get most of his songs (except for his cover songs) on my station. I remember listening to "Cars" when I was in highschool and feeling the same way that I felt when he sang his "I'll Show You" and "One Way or Another

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: I have a love/hate relationship with this band. I love the music they have put out. I love the band. I have a lot of love for them. I can't say that I hate them, I just don't like them. When I think of Kurt Cobain, the first thing that comes to my mind is Nirvana. However, I think about the whole "Nirvana" thing a lot, and I am not a fan of that term.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The worst album of all time. Too many annoying raps, repetitive beats, and overall an abomination. It is a real shame that a person as talented as Kurt Cobain didn't get the chance to be in this great album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I was disappointed with this release. I guess I expected more from a person of Dr. Dre's caliber. I was hoping to hear more of the same style he had on his first few albums. It seems that he is trying to follow the same formula as his earlier releases, but it seems like he is just repeating the same beat over and over. It takes away from the uniqueness of his previous work.  I know that this album was not made to be a hit record, but I just couldn't help but feel that this was all a waste.  I believe it is the worst album of all time.  I am sure that this is a great album for fans, but even then, I don't think its a good choice for anyone else.  There are a few high points (Chronic 2001, Chronic 2002, and Chronic 2003), but overall this album is just a waste of time.  
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:   Dr. Dre is one of the best hip hop artists in the world. There is something to be said for a man that keeps on going and going. If you want to hear a man that is not going to quit even when he is getting killed, then look no further. I have listened to many great albums and I have no intention of putting down this release. This is a great album, however, as much as I enjoy it, I do find that it is a bit too over the top.  I would have to say that if you can find the time to listen to the album, then you will enjoy it.  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:   Dr. Dre's new album "Detox" is a great effort. The beats are a little different than his previous work and there is a new type of flow. The album has that little bit of quality that makes an album great. I like the different styles and how he mixes the different styles. I think Detox will be big.  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The Dr. Dre album Detox is a great album. It is more of the same but with a new sound. The tracks don't have a lot of flow to them, but they are still pretty good. The beats are a little off, but still sound good. This is his best album since Illmatic.

Amazon review: "Detox" is the best album Dr. Dre has ever made. He is the best hip hop artist in the world. He is the main reason why hip hop is so popular.

I think this album has a potential to be huge.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: The asinine politics gets in the way of the music. I listened to this CD at a neighborhood party and had to comment. I would not consider buying it even though Ry Cooder has enormous MUSICAL talent and I have some of his other editions. Hey Ry, stick to music for everyone.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Amazon review: There is just something about Brett Eldredge's tone. I just love to listen to him sing

Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The songs have a great, relaxed feel to them.  My favorite songs are: the first song ("Unraveled"), the second song ("You're Gone"), the third song ("Never Fade Away"), and the fourth song ("I'm Not a Nice Girl"), which is a great song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album.  It's got a great flow, and I can't seem to find a single bad track.  It's definitely a solid listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is well thought out and well produced.  I like the songs on it, but I think they could have gone a little more with the production, which seems a little "cold" compared to a few others I've listened to in the past.  I liked the first song ("Let it Rain") and really liked the second song ("Sleeping at Last").
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I liked this album, probably better than the one before it, and I liked it for the most part.  The songs are good, but a few are better than others, and some of the songs are better than others.  Of course, as a fan of both bands, I also liked both of them, and the album is great.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was really excited to get this CD as it made me realize how much I enjoy this style of music.  And I can't say enough good things about this album.  The songs are good, the lyrics are good, and the sound is good.  It's a real winner of an album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album was a real treat to listen to.  It reminded me of the early 90's in so many ways.  It's good music, and it's good music with a good flow.  I was especially happy with the songs that were released in the last year, and the last two songs I like are "Time Out" and "All I Wanna Do."  The music on this album is just a real treat.  All I Want to Do is a great song with a great flow.  There's nothing better that can be said about this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This has a great flow to it.  There's not really much bad about this album.  I liked the first song ("I Wanna Be"), and the second song ("Time Out") was pretty good as well.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I thought this CD was great, I didn't really expect it to be that good.  The songs are nice and the production is very good, and the lyrics are all sung by the same guy, so they all flow nicely together.  I really liked the last song in the album, "All I Want to Do."  The album doesn't really have a bad song, but it could have been more "out there" and more exciting. I have not been this excited about a lot of albums since the 80's.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't normally buy CD's that have a lot of words, and I don't normally buy CD's that have a lot of vocals, but I could not resist this one.  The songs are very good and different.  The lyrics are all new and fresh.  I like the first song ("I Am"), and the second song ("Just Another Day").
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I was not expecting much from this album, but I was not expecting it to be much good.  The songs are all good and I can't really put my finger on why I like them, but I like them.  I liked the first song, "I'm Not a Nice Girl," and the second song, "It's My Birthday."  The third song, "Time Out," was good too.  Overall, I don't think I would play this CD to anyone, but if you're a fan of this kind of music, you'll like this CD.

Amazon review: I wasn't sure what to expect from this album, but I still wasn't expecting much from it.  The songs are all good, and the music is always enjoyable.  I thought the first song would be good, but it was not.  The songs on this CD are not my favorite, but the songs I do like are all good.  This is a great album to buy.  It is a good album.
