Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This was by far the best CD I have ever heard! Wow. I have been playing this CD non stop for the last couple of days. The sounds are amazing. The lyrics are very meaningful.

Amazon review: This is great. The songs are very catchy, and the music is a great combination of rock and pop. It's very easy to listen to, and the sound is great. The vocals are clear, and the lyrics are very relatable. The only thing that's not perfect is the use of an orchestra instead of a choir.

Amazon review: This CD sounds great. I was a little bit disappointed when I first heard it because I was expecting something like the first two albums. This one is a little bit different. I like songs like "My Funny Valentine" and "If I Could Turn Back Time" better than other songs. The sound of this CD is better than the second CD. The lyrics are also good, but I feel like the songs may be a little bit repetitive. The music is great. I think the second album was better than this one.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Also, the lyrics to "No More" need a bit of work.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: This band is like a really bad version of The Allman Brothers Band, only with a more pop-oriented sound.

I recommend this to anyone who's an Allman Brother lover.

Amazon review: I've been wanting to start a rock band for a while now.  This album is the first one.  It's definitely a good start.  The songs are really good.  It just doesn't have the same vibe as the other stuff I've been listening to.  I like the fact that it's a really pop sound, but I also like the "punk" vibe that the song has.  You can tell that this band is very much a live band.  I'm not sure I'd put them in the same category as any bands like The Allman Brothers or The Rolling Stones, but they're definitely on the same level.  Just hope that they don't start to sound like they're trying to sound like Black Sabbath.

It's not the cd that is bad, its the CD that is missing the songs I wanted.  I have tried to contact support, but they sent me to a helpdesk that I have had to call for help.  I think the best thing to do would be to buy another version of the CD, unless I can find it on the internet.  It took me a while to find it.  I just feel the CD is getting old and that is it...  I will see if I can find a way to get the songs I want.  I just hope the song's are available on the internet.

I have tried to get the customer service agent to give me a reason, but I have been told to email support.  I have emailed them 5 times, and have not received a response from them.  I have tried emailing customer support at multiple email addresses, and have not had a response from them.  I have sent 3 emails to the CEO of the company that made the CD, and he did not reply.  What is the best thing I can do to get the CD back to me?  Please help me.  Thank you for reading my review.

Amazon review: Purchased this CD to replace the missing CD's from my dad's collection, but I ended up not liking the CD...  First, I have had problems with the CD in the past, and have had to purchase another version of the CD.  I tried getting it back from them and I couldn't, but they were kind enough to send me the cd to me, so I thought I would give it a go.  I have had problems with it, and it seems like they have lost every song I had on the cd.  I have taken the cd back to them more than 6 times.  They have sent me to a helpdesk, I have had to call the helpdesk at least 6 times, and have been told to email support.  Even after emailing support, I have had to call customer support at least 4 times to get a response.  I have sent them 4 emails and have not received a response.  I have sent an email to the CEO of the company that made the cd, and he did not reply.  What is the best thing I could do to get the cd back to me?  Please help me.

About the song: Good song, but very annoying, because the whole song is played.  Also the song is in 2 parts, not 3.  I have tried to play the song in an MP3 player with no success.  If I could only get this song back to me once I would be happy.  I would like this to be a new cd.  The song is called "A Nightingale Sing in Barkley Square", and the song is by Tuxedo Junction.  I think the song is good.  I hope the song can be downloaded again.  I do not see the point of having it on Amazon.  I will continue to wait for the song to be restored.  I have purchased many cds in the past, however I have had problems with everything from the cd's to the video games to the television.  I think I will hold off on purchasing other cd's for now.  I do not like the fact that I can't download the song on my computer.  If I could download the song onto my computer, I would be happy.  I am not happy with the fact that the song is only a 2-song cd.  I would like the song to be 3-5 songs, or maybe even a full cd with everything.  I am not happy with having to pay for something that I don't want to have.  This is a huge problem with purchasing a cd.  I

I was very excited to get the CD from this company. I thought everything was going to be great, but alas, this was not the case.

I thought it would be a great way to unwind and find some peace and quiet, but I was not able to find any.

Everything on the CD was very good, but I was disappointed in the music.

The CD started with a couple of tracks that were very good. "All I Want" and "My Favorite Thing" were beautiful but nothing compared to the really beautiful "The Prayer of Life" and "You May Be Happy When You Are Dead".

I was so pleased to hear songs like "One of a Kind", "Blessings of Life" and "I Am a Stranger" because I love some of Don Shirley's music. "The Prayer of Life" was not his best, but still a very good song.

Then, the CD went on to "The Spirit of Christmas" and "Be the One that makes the World Right".

I was very excited to hear that song because it was my favorite, but I was not able to find any other songs like "The Prayer of Life" and "You May Be Happy When You are Dead" because they were all different.

I was very disappointed to hear "Blessings of Life" because it was the best song on the CD, but I was able to find "One of a Kind" and "You May Be Happy When You Are Dead" because they were different.

The CD ended on a good note because the CD started off with a couple of songs that were very good.

I was very excited to hear the songs "All I Want" and "My Favorite Thing" because they were beautiful, but I was not able to find anything else on the CD because they were different.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs that were written to help a Christian understand what God is like.  These lyrics were written to help a person get a better understanding of God and what He does.  The song is a little different from the other songs on the album,  The lyrics are almost too short to read and the music is not as good as other songs.  But the music is good enough to listen to and I love the song.  I think this album is a great way to introduce people to other Christian songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

He does not need a producer, he does not need to be in the studio, and he does not need to rely on a star singer. And he writes what he wants on his own, as he always has. There are no stars in this album. The songs are all his own, in his own image. It's his music, it's how he wants to be remembered. Nothing can compare to how he sounds now.

Amazon review: I'm an Eminem fan for a long time.  I have listened to a lot of his albums.  This album might not be Eminem's best album, but it's not his worst album either.  This album has a lot of great songs.  This album has some good songs and some bad songs.  This album is a little different from Eminem's other albums as well.  If you like Eminem's music, this is the album for you.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review:  I'm a sucker for a good western. I've seen way too many of them to count now, and I can't take being away from my westerns for too long because they're so darn fun to listen to. There's no reason why they should be on this list, but they are, and I'm glad I found this album.

Amazon review: Just when I think I found a great western, I find a great western.  But, just for my own personal reasons, I love the sound of the horns and the fiddle.

And, it's got the best voice ever!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

I have bought their records and cassettes over the years, and have always been pleased.  As a fan of The Band, I was a little disappointed that their debut album, I Believe I Can Fly, was not as good as I had been expecting.  However, this CD shows that the band has taken it to a new level with their follow-up CD, and was not disappointed.  I'm glad that I made the purchase, and hope to hear much more from this band in the future!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

This movie is one of the best of the year.  The movie has some of my favorite songs.  I have two words to describe this movie:  Epic.  I'm very happy to have seen this movie.  I love all things Clint Eastwood.  I feel like I know Eastwood a bit better now.  I love it when he goes into his character and tells them that he's going to ruin everything.  I have to say, I'm glad he didn't ruin the movie.  The movie is a masterpiece.  I don't know whether I'm going to go back to see the movie again.  I wish I did.  I have to see this movie again.  I saw the DVD and it was worth the money.  I'm glad I saw it.  I'm glad I saw any movie with Clint Eastwood in it.  This is my favorite movie of the year.  Clint Eastwood is a great guy and a great actor.  He is one of the greatest actors of all time.  I don't want to hear negative comments about this movie.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor is such a great artist.  She has such a unique voice that goes with lyrics that are just plain awesome.  Her voice is just so powerful and really pulls you along with her.  I was really excited when she was announced as the next "American Idol" judge.  She is definitely someone I would have loved to see on the show.  Her voice and style reminds me of a young Amy Winehouse.  The only flaw in the show is that she sings the same two songs in every episode.  I don't think this will change any time soon.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I wish Meghan Trainor would go back to singing songs that are not like the ones she sang on "Idol."  I think she would be a better artist if she took the time to develop her own style.  As a matter of fact, I think she would be a better artist if she didn't sing at all.

Amazon review: This album is a good mix of all the songs she released.  I like the new songs and the old songs, but I would have preferred that she stopped singing the same songs everyday.

Amazon review: I love the new songs on this album.  The songs I like on this album are not on the "Idol" album.  I am disappointed because she released an album that was nothing like what she did on "Idol," and I thought she should have just played shows with new songs.  All of her songs are boring.  I don't care if she sings them or not.  As long as she sings them, I will still like them.  I don't mind that she has a different style of singing and that she is better than the new songs, but I don't like the new songs on this album.  The songs don't have any emotion in them at all.  I like to watch her on TV as she sings her songs, but they make me feel bored.  She is more talented than the new songs.  I really don't like the songs she sings on this album.  They are not very original, and I don't like that she can sing them.  I like to listen to her voice when she sings, but the songs are just boring.

Amazon review: The only thing I really like about this album is that she is still singing songs from "Idol."  I love the songs she did on "Idol," but those songs were not her best songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
