Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Prince since the early '80s. His style has always been unique and his music has always been great. He was one of the first musicians to explore the world of pop with his own unique style and sound. I own the CD "Ebony and Ivory" and have no intention of buying any Prince collection. I have a whole lot of music in my collection from different artists that I have been collecting for years and years, but Prince is one of the artists that just gets better with age and I don't believe he's going anywhere anytime soon.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is a collection of songs that have an important message for both the church and general society. The songs are written from the perspective of a Christian, and they are an attempt to create a positive world. The songs are all about 'love' and the positive experiences that come along with it. The songs themselves are very much about the positive experiences that we have while in relationship with our spouses, parents, children, friends, and in general throughout most aspects of our lives. This album has not been made with any religious purpose in mind. It is simply a collection of songs that have been written to bring about a positive message.

Amazon review: I purchased this album last year after hearing some of the songs on the radio and seeing the video of the album "The One". I am not familiar with the name of the artist, but I am familiar with the song "I Wanna Be Loved" and I thought this is a must hear album. I am a Christian and I am very familiar with the words "I Wanna Be Loved" by Led Zeppelin and the song is a great example of Christian music and faith. This album is a good reminder to put a positive spin on things.

It gives the listener a positive message with humor. I would recommend this album to everyone who loves the music and is looking for a positive message!

Amazon review: I just watched a YouTube video about a different singer named Lyle Mays.  He is a very talented singer who has been a big influence on me.

When I watch the video, I think it would be right to say it is a "hymn"

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: This is not my favorite record by The Beatles; however, it is my favorite of the Lennon/McCartney albums.  I find the music on this album to be more interesting than that on other Beatles albums.  From the opening notes on "I Feel Fine," this is a record that is really more of a musical conversation than a song.  The musical conversation is a bit more difficult to hear than the songs themselves, but is well worth a listen.

Amazon review: A very interesting album.  I love the lyrics and the music is very good.  I have not yet heard the CD because I have not yet had the CD player.  However, I can not say that it is not worth the $14.95 it costs to have the CD.  I have heard that the CD player is a little slow so I have to wait a few seconds before I can play it.  I have not yet had it because I have not found the CD player.  However, I enjoy this album very much and would not have any hesitation in recommending it to others.  I think that the album is worth it.

Amazon review: The only negative about this album is the album itself.  This is a very good album.  There is a little bit of a problem, which is that the songs are a little bit too long.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: The story goes that once upon a time a man and woman went to a restaurant for dinner and while they were having dinner a child was born to them. They named the child George Washington and the child grew up to be the US President. However, since George was so very smart he didn't know what was good and what was bad for him. One day the father of the child said to George that he should always tell the truth because that was the only way to make him a better person. George replied that he was sure he could never be a good person if he lied to himself. The father said that George should always tell the truth. George said that he would never tell the truth because he would always be lying to himself. The father said that George should tell the truth because it's the only way to be a good person.

The melody, rhythm and harmony are all excellent. 
The only bad part is the vocals.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song, I was completely taken aback by its beauty, and I was like "How the hell did this guy do it?" I thought this song was great, and it is a lot harder to listen to than it is to sing. The first thing I thought when listening to this song is "Wow!" and the second thing I thought was "Why the hell didn't I think of that before I started singing?" The music is great and the lyrics are good, but I'm not a huge fan of this song. I think it's a little too short, but that's okay! The song is amazing anyway!

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: one of my favorites of all time.  The guitar playing is excellent.  The production is amazing.  I would have liked to have had a few more songs by him.

Amazon review: One of the better Mike Varney tribute albums that is less like his usual type of stuff and more like an album of his music.  I don't think that I've ever heard him play guitar like this before.  I like the fact that he has sung a song where he sings "I could not love you and you could not leave."  It is a soulful song.  I like it and it is my favorite.  I would give it a rating of A-.  Mike Varney was a talented musician and a great friend to many.

Amazon review: I was introduced to this song when I saw it used by the band on the TV show "The Simpsons" and I was immediately hooked.  The song was catchy, the lyrics were clever and the music was just plain fun.  I have found that this song is a great choice for my wedding playlist.  It is also a great choice for my children's music playlists.  This recording has a great mix of instruments and vocals.  I have also found that many of my friends like this song as well.  This is a great little song and I plan on buying the whole Ode to Joy album when the time comes.  I am just not sure why they included this song in this cd.  This song is great but it is just not a part of the Ode to Joy.  Thank you for listening!

Amazon review: These songs are from a CD titled A Tribute to the Music of the Grateful Dead, Volume 1.  They are simply great songs.  I have listened to this cd quite a few times and I am always amazed by the quality of the tracks.  I have always wanted to see some of these songs in concert so that is why I have purchased this cd.  The only thing that I can say that about this album is that it is not well marketed.  In a perfect world, I would have loved to have had a CD that was marketed this way.  When I first heard this album, I went to Amazon and purchased it there.  I did not know that it did not come on the CD.  I would have liked to have seen some of the pictures of the Grateful Dead to see if they were included in the album.  I am not sure what the problem was with this cd.  The only thing that I can say is that it is well done and I will have to buy the cd when it comes out.  I am not in a rush.  I am just happy that I was able to find this cd and that I can now listen to this new music.  I am happy that I am able to help you all out.  Please put these songs on your next cd.  Thanks for listening!  I am going to continue to buy your music,  but I am going to be watching for a while to see what you have in store for me.

I will have to wait and see if it is worth the money.  I like the way they blended the music with the vocals.  I don't like the music much like other blues artists.  It is just a little too much to me.  I do think that this cd is better than most blues artists.  I like it because it is not very long and all the songs are good.  I like the way they blended the music with the vocals.

Amazon review: I was introduced here by another reviewer, so I figured I would offer my own opinion.  I have not been able to find a good way to describe this music, so I will just say that it is very, very, very good.  I have listened to this cd twice, and I am going to buy the cd when it comes out.  I am not in love with any of the songs, but I will keep listening to it.  I enjoy the different styles.  I like the way they blend the music with the vocals.  I wish that it was longer, but I am not sure if that is possible.  I wish that the musicians would play the chords that they are supposed to play.  I have heard that this is not the case, but I wish that they would play the chords that they are supposed to play.

Amazon review: I am not sure why I am reviewing this.  I have heard a couple of reviews, where people have said that the guitar is not loud enough.  I think that the sound is good.  I have played this cd around a bit and I am really enjoying it.  I have two cats, so I may have to buy some extra headphones.  I think that I like this very much.  I wish I had it from the beginning.  I am just not sure why they did not add more songs to the CD.  I think that they should have just added one or two more songs.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: Well, I had to give this a try to see what it is all about. I think it is all very well done and the piano and string parts (and the vocal) sound fantastic. But when I thought about it for a while, I realized that even the song itself is kind of boring. I mean, it is fun, and a little bit different from previous versions, but I would have rather listened to the original version by Leonard Bernstein, which was much more impressive.
Sentiment: Negative

A:

The problem is that you have to have two values for each of the two criteria.
For example:
A1: I'm a good listener, and I listen to this song A2: I'm a good listener and I listen to this song
and this should be equal to 1.
This is a very simple problem, but it can be done if you are willing to use a simple approach.
To solve this, you could use something like this:

Create a new column called "A" with the value of "A1".
Create another new column called "B" with the value of "A2".
Create a new column called "C" with the value of "B".

You now have the values of the columns "A", "B", "C".
Now, you can easily fill them with a value like "1.5" using something like this:
=IF(C1="A2",IF(C2="A2",1.5,1),IF(C1="A3",IF(C2="A3",1.5,1))).
(You can also use the following:
=IF(C1="A2",IF(C1="A3",IF(C2

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a long time. I started listening to it in the early days of the internet in the late '90s. After I got connected to the net it was amazing. I remember there was no way I could possibly have found this album without the internet. It was so amazing. I loved all the songs on this album.

Amazon review: This is weird.  I ordered Classics based on a friend's recommendation.  It came today.  All looked good: cased, CD, enclosure.  Then I started to play it - the music is from Skyworld.  It is okay - but certainly not what I expected or wanted.  Now what?  I guess in order to post this I will have to at least give it one star.  Disappointed in your quality control.

I've listened to several CDs but this one is the only one that I could listen to without having to constantly change the CD to listen to the music which is great.  I'm not really a big jazz fan, so the only album I own is a classical compilation of Mozart's Requiem so having this one was a treat.

This is the first jazz album to appeal to me.  I have been listening to jazz music for about 30+ years and have not heard a jazz album I truly enjoyed.  This is the first jazz album that I have ever listened to that I have actually enjoyed listening to.  I have not been able to listen to jazz for the past 20+ years.  I have enjoyed listening to jazz albums that I have liked, but this is the first one that I have actually listened to that I have truly enjoyed.  It has good piano, good saxophone, and good guitar.  I would rate this album as an eight.  I rate this album as a ten.  I would rate this album as a ten.  I would rate this album as an eight.  I would rate this album as a ten.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: What ever happened to melody and harmony?  You surely won't find any here.  If you like the current over produced, over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this.  I read that she said she had 200 songs, but it sounds like she had one song cut into 15 segments for this 'deluxe' edition of the cd.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I was lucky enough to pick up this CD and I must say it's been an awesome experience collecting it. Many albums have been released with several artists, but this is the only one with just one artist on each disc. The first 2 discs consist of one disc each, with the exception of "Mozart in Mozart" which is comprised of two discs.  The sound is beautiful and the CD is very easy to listen to. This is a must have for any collector.  There is a slight scratch/flutter on the first disc, but it's not too distracting.  I highly recommend this CD.  I've also heard that one artist's albums were released with 2 or 3 discs, but this is the only one that I have found with just one.  This is definitely a great buy.
