Amazon review: It's been a while since I've seen a Clint Eastwood movie that I actually enjoyed. This one, though, didn't disappoint. Eastwood is actually very watchable as he takes on the villainous role of the evil gangster. There was a solid mystery at the beginning that was very well done. The movie took a twist at the end, but, again, it was well done and the ending was satisfactory (even though it was a bit abrupt).

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

I would give it 3 stars if they didn't put in a cd of the "new" material they have planned for Jewel's 4th album. The first cd is what I expected, nothing fancy, not as good as her previous cd. Now they have added a cd with new material and some of the old material that is on the cd I received from her that I previously received from her.

It's a pity that they don't include the cd I received from her before the release of the new stuff. I really didn't know much about her previous cd.

I am not a fan of Jewel's. I don't listen to her music but this is just sad.

This CD is awful. I am not a fan of her music but it doesn't make it any better. Just a really bad CD. I would say that the cd is terrible to begin with and then add on top of it is the fact that the packaging is poor quality and the CD is not even a deluxe edition. The only plus to this CD is that it is a Jewel CD. I really don't want to add anything more to this CD and I hate that they put it out.

Sentiment: Positive

I'm not sure why I like it so much.  Maybe because I'm singing my own song.  "Bella Notte" has a great melody and great lyrics.  I'm not too familiar with the song so I can't say anything more.  Other than that, I don't know.  I liked the other songs, though, but I just didn't like this one.

I've never really been a fan of opera.  I've never tried to learn it or even understand it.  And I'd still rather listen to an oldies station.  But I do like "Fiddler on the Roof."  I really like the song, and I liked the cast album.  And I'm glad I bought this CD because I've been wanting to get a CD with the cast of "The Good Wife."  I'm sure this album has a great cast album, but I've never even seen it.  Maybe I'll go to the theater and buy a CD of "The Good Wife."  And I'll get a CD of "The Good Wife."  And I will get one of each cast album.  I'll get all of them.  And I'll listen to them all the time.  I like opera.

I am a huge fan of this cast album.  I have listened to it several times.  The singing is great.  The music is great.  And I have to say that I love the song "B

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Not happy with it. Only contained 11 songs. The digital has 18. Some of my favorites wee not on the cd.

Amazon review:  I was impressed by this album, especially the song "Don't Worry Be Happy".  The tracks are very hard to describe.  There is a sound in the tracks that I can only describe as a sorta jazzy, rock & roll feel to it. The songs are hard to describe as well.  The songs have all been written by Twiztid, but they are all different.  There is a certain sound that some songs have that makes them stand out from the other tracks.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I wanted to like this, but the song 'Gotta Get Away' is just too over the top!  I could not get past the first minute.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I just bought this, hoping for something that would really help me to sing.  What I have learned so far is that my voice is not strong enough for this type of music.  I was just looking for something that would help me to sing, but I don't think I'm going to give up singing just yet.
I have been singing since I was 3 or 4 years old, so singing is really not new to me.  I just love to sing, but I don't think it is something I will be able to sing without the breathing tips or whatever it is that the instructor is using.  My voice is so deep that I find it very hard to sing, so I just don't think I'll ever be able to sing as good as I want to.
So, I just wanted to help someone out, and to be honest, I really didn't think that this song would help me to sing, but I'm very glad that it did.

I am a little embarrassed to say that I bought this cd because I really didn't think it would help me to sing, but I am very glad that it did.  I can't believe that I bought this CD because I thought it would help me to sing.  I have been singing since I was 3 or 4 years old, so singing and music is really not new to me.  I just love to sing, and I just love to sing as loud as I can, but I don't think I'll ever be able to sing as good as I really want to.
So, I just wanted to help someone out, but I don't really think that I will be able to sing as well as I want to.  So, I just wanted to help someone out, and I am very glad that it did.

I found this song on the new CD's by Smooth Jazz on Amazon, and I really liked this song.  I bought it because it was on the new CD's by Smooth Jazz, which are the only new CD's I've bought ever since I heard them, on iTunes.  I have been listening to Smooth Jazz since I was a little kid, but I was a little unsure about this song.  I was a little nervous about singing this song because I found it on Amazon and I didn't want to miss it, so I bought it.  This

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I have always found the Schubert recordings to be of higher quality than those of the others.  My wife has been a fan of his for years and after listening to a couple, I have decided to purchase the entire series.  The first CD is a very good selection of songs, including songs of the highest quality.  The pianist, the accompanist, and the conductor make the first CD worth buying.  The voices are very high quality and the accompaniment very good.  The recording of Beethoven's piano concerto ( Op. 24) is remarkable.  The recording of Chopin's second piano works ( Nocturnes) is excellent.  The recording of the second piano concerto ( Op. 44) is very good.  The recordings of the Nocturnes and the Concerto are just the first of many that I expect to have in the future.  The songs are good, and the performance of the accompanist and conductor are very good.  The recordings of the vocal works are also of good quality.  The recording of the piano works is very good, but not as impressive as others.  The recording of the songs for voice and piano is good, but not as good as others.

Amazon review: He needs a better voice. He's too low and it's not like he's singing along with the beat, he's just singing a few bars, which makes his voice seem smaller and weaker.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: This is one of those CDs that I think I will enjoy listening to, but I may not make it through all of the music.  The music is so repetitive and boring, it's hard to get into.  I have been to several concerts in Nashville, and have listened to several different artist's CDs, and this is by far the most boring concert I have ever attended.  The songs are all the same, the musicians are all the same, and the melodies are all the same.  This may be the only CD I will listen to, because of the repetitiveness.  It is possible that this is a good CD, but I would not recommend it to anyone.

David T. (U.S.A.)

I am a fan of Robert Johnson, but I have never seen him in concert. I am a fan of the genre of music called Rock. Robert Johnson is one of the most important, and influential, Rock and Roll musicians of all time. I love his music, and have for a long time.

I was surprised when I found out that Robert Johnson produced an album of his own music. I have always thought that this was a one-man project, but I was wrong.

I think this is probably my favorite Robert Johnson album. At times, Robert Johnson is the most influential, and revolutionary, voice of Rock and Roll.

A personal highlight on this CD is the bluesy rock that is sprinkled throughout the songs.

I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Rock and Roll music, and to anyone who has any interest in Robert Johnson.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Eminem for a long time, but I had never had the chance to hear him live. I just wanted to be able to listen to the album without all the hype. The album is extremely listenable. The only thing I have to complain about is that I would have liked to have a little more personality in my album. One of my favorite songs on the album is called "Hail Mary." I'd love to have Eminem live, but I can't do that and keep listening to this album on my ipod. This album is excellent. I will purchase again if I ever hear it on the radio.

This album is one of the most unique albums you can buy. I don't think there is a song on the album that I don't like. The only song I don't like is the first song on the album, "Hip Hop." I am a huge Eminem fan and I didn't think he could top his first album, but he did.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!
