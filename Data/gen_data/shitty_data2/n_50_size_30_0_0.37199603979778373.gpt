Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Meghan Trainor is a very talented singer.  I love her style, but I just can't listen to her music anymore.  At least I didn't think so.   I was really bummed that I had to listen to this CD twice before I realized what the problem was.  You see, the singing is fine, but the lyrics are just so dry!  I feel like I'm going to get a headache from listening to this CD.  I'm disappointed.

Amazon review: I really liked this CD.  I like the song "You Don't Know Me" by Meghan, but this CD is not really the same.  You can't tell that much from this CD.  I think I'm going to buy "Love on Top" by Meghan Trainor.  I am a big fan of her music and I am glad she is back.

I have listened to this album several times and I can't wait to hear it again to make sure I have not missed anything.  I can't say anything else because I don't want to sound like a big baby. I have had good things come to me from someone that I don't like, but I try to enjoy them anyway. This album is not my cup of tea.  I like Trainor's other albums, but there is something about this one that I just don't get.  I have enjoyed the songs on other Trainor's CDs but not this one.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

This is a great album, but it is very repetitive and predictable, and the vocals sound like Twiztid is doing the female parts.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

In this case, the song is not the one that sings, but the title of the song, A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  If you can read this, you know what I mean.  This song is very touching.  This is the song that gives me goose bumps, and I am sure this can be attributed to the fact that it was sung by Lin Manuel Miranda.  I am a very emotional person,  and I felt the same way listening to this song. The voice, the melody, the lyrics, and Lin Manuel Miranda's passion for this song made this a very emotional song for me. Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius lyricist.

In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I've been a huge fan of "The Chronic" since my teen years.  I'm a fan of the music that the author has created, and I'm also a fan of the subject matter of this book.  I think if you've been in a band your whole life you'd understand the frustration of having to constantly put out new music.  But I didn't realize just how much money it takes to put out the music.  In addition to that, I find it very sad that I could just go out and buy a CD player for $100-200 or more.  I don't understand why I would be a fan of someone who is not truly a true artist, not a true musician.  I'm sure there are many people out there who agree with me, but this book makes me question my opinion.

I get a lot of people complaining that this song is the same as the song before.  They are the same lyrics and they don't have a hook.  I've heard this song before a lot, and I really like it.  I like the drums, the rapping is okay.  I don't like the music.  I think it's just a filler album.  I think it's a filler album.  It's all the same music.  It's all the same music.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I wanted to buy this CD, but I found out it was an early 90's CD and not the latest one.  I found out about it on Amazon.com, and looked it up on Amazon.com's website (to see if there had been any changes since that time.  There had not.  I then went to Amazon.com, and bought it, and had it shipped to me.  However, on my arrival, the CD was not in the package.  I put it on the CD player, and the CD would not play.  I put the CD player back in the box and tried to play the CD again, but the CD player would not play the CD.  I called Amazon, and they called in a return manager, and he told me that the CD had been sold to a customer, whom I was to try to return it.  The CD player would not play the CD.  I then called the customer, and she told me that she received the CD from Amazon, and that she was going to return it to Amazon.  So, I called Amazon.  They told me to return it to the customer, and there was no way that I could return the CD to the customer.  I then called the customer, and she told me to return the CD to Amazon.  I could not find out to whom the CD had been sold to, and told her I didn't want it, and to return it to Amazon.  I contacted Amazon, and they told me they do not have a receipt showing that the CD was sold to the customer, and that Amazon does not return CDs.  This is the only CD that I have ever had a problem with.  However, Amazon still does not return the music to the customer.  I have contacted the customer several times, and she has always told me where the CD was, and that she still has it.  However, Amazon does not return the CD, once they make it available.  So, I cannot return the CD to the customer.  I am now considering sending the CD back to Amazon, for a refund, and then sending it to the customer, in the hope that she will tell Amazon where she sent the CD, and then Amazon will return it to her,  and maybe I will have a problem of my own to deal with.

Amazon review: This is my favorite CD of the year.  It was also voted one of the top CD's of the year on Amazon.  It is a great album for listening to while doing "work", or when you have to work on taxes, or the computer, or the washing machine, or the car, or the garbage can, or the lawn mower, or the computer, or even the washing machine.   This CD is great for all of the above tasks.  The songs are the perfect music for any of the above tasks.    I like this CD the best of all the CDs I have ever bought at CDBaby.com.

I just keep on doing what I'm doing.  I just sing and play music, and I just keep on living my life.  I don't think about the big picture.  I just keep on living my life to the fullest and enjoy every moment of it.  That's about it.  It's just my life.  Yeah, life's about enjoying every moment of it.  I guess that's about it.  I've got to go to work, and I got to go to school.  I've got to take care of myself.  I guess that's about it.  I guess that's about it.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  As a diehard Twiztid fan, I can see why their albums were so good.

And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: This album is boring, and although the first song (I'm a Loser) is very good, all the rest of the album is average. It is a little more interesting than the previous two albums. The other two albums are also good, but don't really change the story of the album and the only songs that I can listen to are the two on the first CD. I would not recommend this album to anyone.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

The lyrics are heartfelt and the music on it is excellent.  There is nothing I have ever heard that compares to this CD.  I am so glad I was able to take her class.  I am now a better professional singer, and I am still expanding my repertoire as a singer.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves great music.

I have always been shy about singing.  When I first heard this CD, I was terrified to sing on key.  That was the only way I could move my mouth and sing.  I had no idea I had a voice.  When I first heard the song "In A Ghetto" by Steve Patrick, I started to cry.  That was the first time I really felt like I had a voice.  I was so excited to be able to sing this song on key.  After that, I was singing as if I had a voice.  The songs on the CD are all different and all are so meaningful.  On the CD, the music is so emotional.   I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to build a voice.  I am now a better singer.

When I first heard the song "I Can't Get Enough," I just began to cry.  It is so powerful.  This album is so good.  The song "On the Way Home," by Billy Strings, is one of my favorite songs.  I have been listening to this song for years and I love it.  I think it is so good that I am going to buy the CD for my father.  He loves a good jazz tune.  When I first heard the song "On the Way Home," I just began to cry.  The song "All I Really Need" is one I have been listening to for years.  It is so powerful.
