Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is the first time I have bought any CD and I have to say I was very disappointed in this CD.  The CD is called "Let the Worshipers Arise" and it is the only song on the CD I didn't know the song was from.  The song is only 1 song and I was looking forward to buying it.  In all fairness though there are many good songs that I have bought from Amazon and it is not all about the cost.  At least they didn't try to sell me the CD.  The songs I have bought were from their Music for the Whole Family collection.  This CD is only for Christians and their only purpose is to make Christians feel good.  I'm not a Christian so I don't have to listen to this CD.

Amazon review: I wanted to buy this CD from Amazon and I was excited to do so because it has a theme of worship music and it is from the Lord.  I was hoping that because it was from the Lord that it would be good and that is why I was buying it.  I have to say that I was disappointed by this CD because it is mostly about worship music and the songs aren't very good.  The songs are very repetitive and some of them are even the same song!  I would not buy another song from Amazon unless it was a song that I really needed.  That is why I am writing this review.  I will write a more detailed review when I get home.

Amazon review: Don't listen to this.  Very disappointed. I was expecting it to be an improvement over the first album.  I was hoping for more from this album. I got a CD for my birthday this year.  It was a box set for the first album and the second album of the CD,  so I thought that the CD would be better.  It was only an extra CD,  the first CD was on it.  It is a really sad thing that people are willing to spend their hard earned money on something they are not really interested in.  I don't know what other people are talking about when they say they listen to this CD,  this is not what I think it is.  I have a CD burner and I can burn CDs,  I don't remember the first album,  I have no idea what it is about,  I don't know what the second album is about,  I know it was recorded in the late 80's,  it could be about the first album,  I don't know,  I think this is a CD by a band called The Gleece.  I don't even really know what kind of music this band is.  The songs I like are about a band called 'The Gleece' and they are on a CD,  I don't know if they are on another CD,  I don't know who this band is,  I do know that they are famous musicians that are from England.  I have a CD called:  The Songs Of The Gleece  CD.  It is different than this CD.  This is just a really simple CD with a bunch of songs that I like.  I don't even know what to say.  I'm really frustrated with people who are willing to spend their hard earned money.  I hope they get what they deserve.  I hope they do not get what they deserve.  I hope they get what they deserve.

I want to have a lot of fun so I don't get down on myself.  I have a lot of fun, but I want to have a little more peace and joy in my life.  I am just listening to this song for a different reason.  I just listened to it again an hour later and I didn't like it.  It is a little too happy for me.  The lyrics are too in your face and I am not into that.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of Robert Johnson and his work. I love the blues and have a good ear for melodies. I'm not a fan of country music but I do like some of the traditional country singers. This CD is great for those who like to learn new songs, or for a change from the standard country music. I was happy to see that he wrote about his own experiences in the song "Don't Give Up the Ship." I'm looking forward to hearing more of his songs.  I found this CD to be a good introduction to this great artist.  I listened to it with the volume turned lower than most. I think I like it that way.

Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say...

When I first heard Robert Johnson I thought he didn't sing very well.  I didn't realize he had a beautiful voice.  He was originally from Chicago and his version of "Lovin' You" is great.  He was a singer of the blues and was not afraid to use his voice.  When he would sing people would want to hear him even though he had a very low voice. I liked that. I thought it was amazing that he did so well.  I had always heard that he wasn't a very good singer but I didn't know why.  I'm glad I listened to this CD and found out. I'm glad I know more about him.

I was frightened by the cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a traditional country singer. We will always remember you.

I was a big fan of Robert Johnson and his work. I love the Blues and have a good ear for melodies. I'm not a fan of Country Music but I do like some of the traditional Country singers. This CD is great for those who like to learn new songs or for a change from the standard Country Music. I was happy to see that he wrote about his own experiences in song "Don't Give Up the Ship." I'm looking forward to listening to more of his songs. I found this CD to be a good introduction to this great artist. I listened to it with the volume turned lower than most. I think i like it that way.

The singing is a little off and some of the lyrics are hard to understand.  I guess I just didn't like the singing style.  As for the songs, I like the ones that were in the original CD - "I Will", "I'm Gonna Miss You" and "Lovely Day".  "Don't Wanna Be Your Friend" is good and "Do You Feel the Same" is interesting.  This CD is just what I was looking for.  I can't wait to get the original CD.

Amazon review: I have to say that I am not a fan of "Lovely Day" CD.  I can't stand the singing style and I'm just not a fan of the music.  This CD sounds like the singer is a little more confident, but I'm not sure she is going to be as successful as she was with the original CD.  I think I was more interested in the original CD, since I have it and it doesn't disappoint.  The song selection is good on this CD, but I still can't stand the singing style.  I have to say that I am not a fan of her new songs.  They aren't anything special, but they are different and I like that.  I don't like "Dilemma" or "Do You Feel the Same" very much.  I don't think they were that great.  I think "We Don't Need the Nightlights" is a great song, but I don't think it's as good as "Lovely Day".  It's ok, but not great.  "If She Wants to Stay" and "Love Me Like You Do" were good, but "Love Me Like You Do" just doesn't sound like her style.  I'm not sure why, but I don't think it's her.

I don't like the song "You Don't Know" and "I Don't Want You" are horrible.  The songs that I like are "I Will" and "I'm Gonna Miss You".  This is the worst CD I've ever heard.  I can't stand the singing style.  I really hope she doesn't go back to her old style of singing.  I guess I'm not a fan of her new songs either.  I'm just not a fan of her new songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times, but I'm not happy with the singing style.  It's not her style and it's not a great song.  I don't like her new songs either.  I'm hoping she'll find a way to get it together and start singing better.  I am a fan of "Love Me Like You Do", "I Will" and "I'm Gonna Miss You".  I think the lyrics are really fun and they are catchy.  I guess I just don't like the singing style.  Just my opinion and I hope she can get her voice back.

Amazon review: I'm sorry I'm not impressed with this album. I thought it was going to be just another one of his weak, boring, mediocre albums. I know it's a new release, but why didn't they put out more new songs, more new singles.  What they have are 4 songs and that doesn't make a good album.  The vocals, the instrumentals, the beat are horrible...they make it sound like Eminem is doing a rap verse, whereas I wanted a good album.  I don't think I'll be buying this album when it comes out, I'll be buying the clean version by mistake.

Amazon review: I like the songs but the instrumentals are just weak. The beats are lame, the vocals are horrible, and the lyrics are lame.  Not even close.  The only positive thing about the album is the bonus tracks.  That's all I can say about this album.  I wouldn't buy it in a million years.

Amazon review: I bought "Eminem" because of the artist.  The artist is Eminem.  I was looking for an album that could make me feel something; something to make me want to listen to it again and again.  I thought that it would be an album I could listen to over and over again.  The songs are good, but not the best.  I think the album is better than it is advertised.  The songs are good, but not the best.  I have listened to the album for about 6 months.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Lo de no encontrar su foto me parece que es de mala fe.  Pero en cualquier caso, espero que la gente pueda escuchar su voz.  Pero al final, la tristeza es que la gente no se da cuenta de que lo que la escuchan, es su voz.  En todo caso, es algo que no es solamente una mala música, sino una mala vida para las estrellas del rock.  Después de todo, en esta canción, hay una tristeza enorme y una desesperación.  Sin embargo, la realidad es que la gente nunca me mira y la escuchan.  Mucha gente, así que la canción, no te puedes imaginar lo agradecidas que me sentí.  Por supuesto, creo que no se debe de hacer una canción para cantar, sino para escuchar, pero en este caso, no se le puede escapar el caso de alguna mala música.  Lo peor es que hay algún que pensar que pueda estar pensando en lo que piensa de mí y no se da cuenta.  Si es que, en cualquier caso, es algo que no se debe de hacer.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I love the way this CD is put together, it's very well structured and well written.  I actually like it. It's just the songwriting that I don't get.  I don't know what the point is in writing a song, for me personally, that has no meaning.  It's just a waste of time and energy.  I could just as easily listen to another song, that has a meaning, and would probably like it more.  If I had to choose, I would have chosen Meghan Trainor, but I won't judge her work unless she decides to put out a CD full of crap.  I can't help but be a little bitter.  I would have paid to have a good song done by Meghan Trainor, but I have no money to spend on CDs.  I will wait for her next CD.

Eggs and Spoon
Amazon review: The album is a collection of mostly jazz-influenced folk songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Eggs and Spoon, a four-disc anthology of traditional Irish folk songs, is the latest in a series of CDs released by Ireland's National Library of Ireland. Though the title of the album suggests its focus is on Irish folk songs, a number of the songs on the CD deal with Irish social issues. The songs were recorded in the late 1940s and early '50s by a number of well-known Irish folk musicians, including Eileen Joyce, Dairey O'Dowda, Moya Brennan, and many others.
Amazon review: The songs are all lovely. They are mostly ballads with a hint of Irish folk music, but also one or two other types of song. There are some very beautiful ones, including "Ave Maria" and "The Soldier's Song." There are also some ballads that are very simple and very simple, but they make me think of old-time Irish ballads.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Just a simple recording of a song that really was the most popular song of the 20th century.  This version is only 2:52 long.  I have found this song to be a bit more complicated than the song it is based on.  I also do not think that this song is actually any more popular than the song it is based on.  The song is still played on the radio, but this version only has the radio stations.

Amazon review: This CD is a recording of a song that was made famous by a young man whose name I do not know.  I found the song to be a bit monotonous and repetitive.  Also, some of the lyrics that are sung in the song are quite inappropriate for the song.  There is a definite lack of passion in the recording of this song, and this is not good.

Amazon review: This is a great CD by the King of Rockabilly, Elvis.  The songs are just the type that you would expect on a King of Rockabilly album.  Although I was a bit disappointed in the recording of some of the songs, I have to say that overall, this is a very enjoyable and enjoyable cd.  The songs are very catchy and the vocals are a joy to listen to.  I was very happy with the cover art.  I am sure that the songs on this cd will have people singing along with the lyrics.  The cover art is very creative.  I really like the cover of "All Shook Up" (I have never seen a cover art like this before).  I also like the cover of "Blue Suede Shoes."  I also like the cover of "Blue Moon Of Kentucky."  I also like the cover of "Blue Suede Shoes."

Amazon review: This album is a waste of time.   I'm not that much into classical music and I have found that many of these musicians have no taste whatsoever.   Some of the songs are almost identical to each other.   When I heard this album for the first time, I felt that it was a waste of time.   I do like some of the classical elements, and I do like the songs that were chosen, but the musical concepts were all over the place.   I don't even know what to say about this album.   It's just not good at all.   If you want to hear high quality classical music, I highly recommend this album highly.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album does not deserve to be on the list of the best classical albums ever made.   This album has some very weak and poor compositions that most classical music lovers would rather not hear in their life.   The musicians in this album don't have a high level of talent.   The musicians do not have any good compositions.   I believe that the classical music lovers will find this album to be very boring if they don't try to listen to it.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I first discovered this band when they were playing at the Mabuhay in Jacksonville, FL.  I had to have them on the album "I'm Alive," so I bought the CD off of Amazon.  I was very impressed with their performance.  The band sounded tight, tight, tight, tight.    I bought their first album, "I'm Alive," on Amazon.  It was a good compilation of their first two albums and it was an easy purchase.    I have to say that I am a big fan of Sarah McLachlan, and I thought that Sarah McLachlan could do anything, and she did it.  I wanted to like this album and then I realized that it was a very mediocre album.  It was a compilation of old material and it's just not good.  It's a classic that has been done many times and it's just boring.  I don't think that Sarah McLachlan is able to write really good songs.  This album is a good album, but I don't think that it's a good one.    I enjoyed the song "How We Met," but I don't think that Sarah McLachlan is the best singer.  The rest of the album wasn't very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was very surprised about how much I had to pay for this album, which was only $20.  I love Sarah McLachlan.  I love her voice.    I purchased this album because it was a good compilation of two albums.  I think it's a good album.  I just wish that it could have been better.  I loved the album, but I don't think that it turned out as good as it was supposed to.  The only thing that made this album a must buy for me was the first song, "How We Met."    The rest of the songs were so repetitive that I just couldn't get into them.  The chorus for the last song in the album was the best one.  If you like Sarah McLachlan, you will love "How We Met."

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
