Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Lyrics to "Lyrics to "Liz and Jack" from the album Liz and Jack by Demi Lavato:

Liz and Jack were so much in love that he went to his favorite place
He went to the ocean in his mind and then he cried
He got so sad and then he cried
He was so lucky that he had a friend named Jack
Liz and Jack were so much in love that he went to the ocean in his mind and then he cried
He got caught in the rain and then he cried
He was so lucky that he had a friend who could play the guitar
He played the melody and then he cried
Liz and Jack were so much in love that he went to a place in his mind
He got so sad and then he cried
He went to the ocean in his mind and then he cried

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

I'm not sure that the songs were recorded with the intent of being released as a group.  Too many other bands have done this and even more are going to do this.  I guess I'm looking at it as if they were really a solo type of band that they have now expanded to a three piece.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I actually like this album. Its not as good as the last one, but it has some nice songs, and the songs are all quite interesting.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: Lanny is one of my all time favorite singers. I listen to him very often. I just find it surprising that he's doing a cover of "You Never Can Tell".  I've always been a fan of Lanny's and his singing style. I'm also really disappointed that he's not singing the full range of his voice as he sings the songs on the CD.  I really love the song, and he's singing it very well.  I just don't think he got it from the original recording.  I feel like it could have been a great song to cover in his set.  It's a shame.

Amazon review: Lanny's voice is very warm and inviting. He is a great singer.  The only thing I don't like about this CD is that the lead singer, Andy, isn't a great singer.

Amazon review: I don't like this song at all.  It is slow and full of mistakes.  It's very sad.  I don't know why he decided to cover this song to be performed at his show.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I've been a fan since I was a kid, so I'm gonna go ahead and admit that I was a little excited when I heard Slipknot playing.  Not only did I like the band it was awesome to see that they were playing in Austin, TX.  The fact that my wife and I were able to purchase the first Slipknot CD, and then we got to see them in concert at the famous House of Blues, was just icing on the cake.
Sentiment: Positive
###

I was just like, "Man, there's no way I'm gonna get to see this band any time soon."  Then they called me and told me to be at the show on Sunday.  I had no idea what to expect.  Basically, I thought I'd be in a room with my parents and then I'd be like, "Oh my gawd, I'm actually gonna see Slipknot."  I would have been more excited if they'd told me to be at the show on Tuesday or Wednesday.  I had no idea how bad I was gonna be.  The first night was great.  They were so friendly and easy to talk to.
Sentiment: Negative
###

I was super excited when I found out they were playing.  I had no idea what to expect. I figured, "Well, they're probably gonna be playing a song or two, and maybe they're gonna do a few Q&A's, and then let's go home."  I was totally wrong.  I saw a bunch of kids with their parents in the front row.  The parents were probably like, "Hey, I want my kid to see Slipknot!"  I was like, "Man, this is way more than I bargained for."
Sentiment: Negative

I did not have high hopes for this event.  It was a Tuesday night and I had a class at 5:00.  I was so excited when I got the call.  I was like, "I'm going to see Slipknot tonight."  I didn't know how bad the show was going to be.  But man at the time, I thought, "Wow, this is awesome."  It was the first show I ever went to where I got to meet the band.  I was super excited to see them.  They were great.  They were really nice.  I was just amazed at how they were able to put on a tight show.  I was really surprised.

After the show, I went up to the merch table and was like, "Man, this is amazing.  I didn't think they were gonna be able to pull this off.  I was really surprised."  They were like, "Hey guys, thanks for coming out."  They were super super nice.  They were like, "Hey, how was the show?"  I was like, "Man, it was really good."  They were like, "Hey."  They were like, "Hey, let's go buy some merch."  They were just really nice.  They were like, "Hey, I haven't seen you in a while."  We started talking, and they were like, "Hey, how's it going?"  I was like, "Man, it's good.  I'm good."  We talked for a little bit, and then I was like, "Can we meet up later?"  They were like, "Yeah, sure."  I thought they were going to be like, "Oh my gosh, man, I had no idea you were such a big fan.  I never knew you were into Slipknot."  I thought they were going to be like, "Oh my god, you're like my new favorite band."  I think they were going to be like, "Oh my god, you're cool."  But they were just super super cool.  I was like, "This is unreal, man."  I was super stoked for them.  It was awesome.

A few years ago, I had the opportunity to meet Slipknot at a show in Dallas, Texas, at the American Airlines Center.  I met the band, Corey Taylor, and their road manager.  They were so kind and friendly, and they were just super cool.  I was super excited and honored to meet them.  They're just a super cool band.

I think these guys are probably the best live band I've ever seen.  I don't think I could see them at any other venue, because they're just so good.  They're so talented.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

This is not your typical "pop" song. The lyrics are quite personal, not necessarily positive or negative, but there is a real sense of sadness in the lyrics. The piano accompaniment is very nice, and the vocal melodies are very nice to listen to.

However, I do wish that the song had been included on a standard CD rather than the LP. I would have preferred a more conventional pop song. The vocal melody on the two tracks that precede the slower ballad are excellent, and the rest of the album has some decent songs on it.

The song "The Way You Look Tonight" is quite good, but I would have preferred a more conventional pop song. The vocals are excellent, but the melody on the two tracks I found to be a little bland.

Overall, I give this album a 3/5. I am not sure why this one is on the "Pop" side of the album. A more conventional song would have been better.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Tech N9ne has always reminded me of a little kid who does not have an allowance.  It was not written to reflect the character of the character.  Tech N9ne wrote the song to get money from the rich guy.  The lyrics are very good.  The song is not the type of song you would expect Tech N9n to write.  I loved it.  I wish Tech N9ne would write more songs like this one.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: This is the fifth album by a band that I really like.  All of these songs are written by a single person.  In the case of this band, they are a group of three from the same country, but with different influences.  I have only listened to this album once, so I do not know how good the music is, but I know that I love it.

Amazon review: I have found some of the albums I have bought to be very good, but, this one just did not live up to the quality of the other albums.  I bought this album because I knew that there would be a lot of different styles and I could not afford to buy all of them, so I bought this album.  It was a lot cheaper than the other albums but, like any other album, this got scratched and played to death.  I am not entirely sure why, it was not my fault.  I am so disappointed in this album.  I love this album, but, for me, I am not sure why I bought this album.  I like listening to music, but, at times, there is a lot of things I am not sure are necessary.  I will listen to this, but, I am afraid that this is not for me.

Amazon review: Just a simple download from Amazon.  I have listened to these songs on several occasions and I have not heard any of them before.  I am not much of a Beatles fan, but, I am a fan of music.  This is by far the best Beatles album.  I have listened to almost every Beatles album, and, this one is by far the best.  I never thought that The Beatles could compete with Bob Dylan.  This album is better than the most of Dylan's albums.  This is one of the best Beatles albums.
