Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Unfortunately for me, I don't feel like I've gotten a good taste of his work yet because most of it is just a collection of solid songs I've heard before.

About Me

I'm a simple guy living in the Chicago area.  I'm a music lover, a writer, a chef, an amateur photographer, an avid cyclist, a runner, and a music lover.  I like to try all kinds of new music (from metal to electro to hip-hop to classical to folk) and I'm always trying to find new and exciting artists to listen to.  I love to travel (I've been all over the world), and I try to get out as often as I can.  I'm passionate about food and cooking, and I like to share it with everyone I meet.  I like to read and I love to write (both fiction and non-fiction).  I also enjoy watching movies and sporting events.  I also have a passion for photography.  I've been a long-time member of the Chicago area's music community, and I have made many new and old friends through it.

About the Blog

This personal music blog is a great way to keep up with all the music I'm listening to, to find new music (and artists) to discover, and to keep up with the music I'm writing about.  It's also a great way to share all the music I'm hearing with my readers.  It's a great place to hear music recommendations from others, and to hear what others are listening to.  It doesn't have a lot of comments, since I tend not to respond to any comments, but I try to respond to anything anyone writes.  If you're the owner of a song and would like it removed, let me know for it to be removed.  It makes my life so much easier!  If you'd like to have your songs removed, please email me.  I'm not very good about responding to requests, but I will do my best to respond to anything you write.  I try to respond to everything, but I'm human and I'll likely forget to respond to something.  If you're the owner of a song that I'm featuring, I'll gladly provide a link to it in the post.  If you'd like me to remove a particular song, please email me and I'll do my best to remove it.  I'll also do my best to keep track of all the artists I write about in the blog.  It might be a bit of a chore, but I'm really good about keeping up with when I write about someone new.  If you're the owner of a song and would like it featured, please email me and let me know!

If you've got any questions, feel free to email me, and I'll try to help you out.  If you'd like to ask me anything (other than about the music you're listening to), please email me.  I'd be very happy to answer any questions or give you any musical advice you might need.  Thanks for visiting!

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: The song is boring.  It sounds like a bunch of people sitting around with their heads together talking.  I could swear there were a couple of different drum beats that could have been used.  This is a good song for a "feel good" type of song, but it was really a bore to listen to.  Nothing really grabbed my attention.  I don't even want to know what the song was about.

Amazon review: My favorite song on the album.  I don't usually write negative reviews, but I do like this song.  It's a great song with a great message.  The lyrics are very appropriate for this song.  It was hard for me to listen to the song since I was so happy with it, but I think it was worth it.  I was going to give 5 stars to the song, but I cant.  It is just too long to be good.  The beat is great.  The song has potential.  The song should have been no more than 5 minutes.  It would have been better if it could have been a few seconds longer.  The song could have been a little more exciting.  It doesn't need to say everything and it doesn't need to say nothing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like this song.  The chorus is very catchy and I like the song.  I don't think it's too long.  It's very well written, and the beat is strong.

I don't like to leave someone, but I do like to say good bye.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I'll never forget the first time I heard "Trouble" by Teleka.  I think it was the first time I had ever heard a rock song actually rock.  I was a huge Teleka fan back then.  I have to admit, I was pretty impressed.  I knew Teleka was a huge deal and that his music would be going down in history.  I was wrong.  I'll never forget the first time I heard "Trouble" on the radio.  It was one of the first rock radio songs I had ever heard.  The radio station played it about 5 times a day.  I was listening to "Trouble" constantly, I was in high school.  It was my first introduction to music.  It changed my life.  I remember I would wait in line in front of the radio station to hear "Trouble" play.  I would sit there and listen to the radio station, I would wait in line for the radio to play "Trouble" and just sit and listen to it.  I was hooked from the first time I heard "Trouble".  I never forgot that song.  To this day, I will never forget it.  I am so sad that Teleka is no longer with us.  How do you feel about that?  I think he is a great artist that deserves to live a life that is as great as he lived.  I'll never forget "Trouble"!  I am so sorry to hear that.  I just hope he finds some peace in the afterlife.  If there is anyone that deserves to have peace in the afterlife, it is Teleka.  The song he wrote for himself "I'll Believe" sums up his legacy.  He wrote the song for himself.  He is a great artist.  He wrote a song that helped him through his struggles.  If he had died in the early 90's, I'm sure his song would have been played over and over again.  It is sad that he died before the song was recorded.  He was an amazing artist.  He was a true musical genius.  I will never forget the first time I heard "Trouble".  I will never forget the first time I heard "Trouble"!  I will never forget "Trouble"!  I will never forget "Trouble".  I will never forget "Trouble".  I'll never forget "Trouble"!  I will never forget "Trompe" and "Trouble"!  I will never forget "Trouble" and "Trompe".  I will never forget "Trouble"!  I will never Forget!  I'll Never Forget!  I'll Never Forget!

I was hoping that the CD would be a work of art in addition to being a great sounding CD.

Great mix of modern and classic music. I love when artists play the same songs over and over again in different arrangements.

The CD was produced by the same man who made the best modern version of "I Can't Stop Loving You."

###

I am so excited to finally have this album in my collection. The first few tracks are great, the rest is average. I only really listened to the first few songs. I am sorry to say that this is not a classic CD, but a good CD.

I have been a fan of Lanny's music for about 10 years. I have never heard this song before. I listened to it a few times on the radio but it really didn't grab me. I did however make my way to my local record store and purchased this CD. I am beyond thrilled with this CD. I have listened to every song on this CD and cannot wait for the next one. It is beautiful.

This is a killer song. It was originally recorded by Lanny for the 'Love Is Lost' album. Lanny actually did a good job of reworking the song and I thought that this was a great song that he had the courage to rework. It has a great message. I found this song very inspirational and I am glad to have heard it.

I will be purchasing the next album, however. I hope to see some new music from Lanny. I am looking forward to the next album which will be released in June.

My wife and I both heard this song on the radio a couple of weeks ago with our kids in the car, and I have to admit, it sounded really good, but hearing it again, I think it is one of the greatest songs of all time, and I'm glad Lanny chose to re-record it.

###

I LOVE this song. I am a huge fan of Lanny and am one of his biggest fans. I have a hard time listening to him sing "I Can't Stop Loving You" because it doesn't fit my own personal relationship with my wife. The song is a great love song.

I really like this music and have purchased several Lanny's albums and singles. I wish he would make another song like this.

This is a great song! I just wish Lanny would do songs like this more often.

###

I think this is one of the most beautiful songs that Lanny has ever written. It is a very moving song and you can tell it is so personal to him. I love the lyrics and the music.

When I first heard this song, I thought it would be great for a movie montage. I am happy to say that I was wrong. This song is a great song that Lanny is singing.

###

I love this song. It is so amazing to me to hear Lanny sing this song. I was really surprised as I had never heard it before. I love this song, and I hope that Lanny puts out a new CD soon.

This is a great song! When I first heard it, I thought it was a little cheesy. But it has a beautiful message! I would love to hear Lanny sing this song again.

This is a great song! It is a great song and I love hearing Lanny sing this song again. The lyrics are beautiful and very personal!

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review:  This is so good I had to make a video for it!  I used to play this on my stereo when I was in the first grade through high school.  I would sit in my class and play this song on cassette.  I was the only person in my class who knew this song.  It was a true music classic!  I would listen to this song before my first period class and talk to myself all the way through class.  I mean, I'm sure the teacher thought I was crazy but this song was sooo good.  I love the opening line.  It actually made me laugh.  I thought it was a joke at first but I figured it out eventually.  I could never get this song out of my head!  In my senior year of high school my friend told me that he had a friend in the class that was a huge Ne-yo fan.  I thought it was weird because they were so different.  The more I listened to this song the more I loved it.  I had to show my friend my favorite song and I played it like a lot.  I showed him the whole song and he played it along.  I liked it so much that I had to play it again and again.  I loved it so much!  Then I got to play it with him and his friend (they were in my class during freshman year) and they were like what the fuck?  Are you retarded?  I was like yeah they're still the same guys.  They were so stupid that they didn't know.  They actually thought I was retarded.  I thought it was so funny that they thought I was retarded because I'm obviously not!

Amazon review:  This is one of my all time favorite songs.  I first heard it in my junior high school class on one of the old computer that were still in use in the computer labs.  The teacher was still teaching the class and the class was almost all girls.  I was always the odd one out in my class all because of my big hair and piercings and the fact that I was in a different grade.  I listened to this song throughout the year and I loved it.  It was a true classic from the 80's.  It was so good that I was constantly hearing it played on the radio and on the television.  I was one of the few people in my neighborhood who had it.  This was a true classic that was played by the big bands of the 80's (The Meters, The B52's) and in the early 90's the big bands of the 2000's (The Strokes, The Strokes Again, The Strokes With John Mayer, The Strokes With David Gray, The Strokes With the Dave Matthews Band and many more).

Amazon review:  This is a real shame for a song that has so much potential.  I'm a huge fan of the band The Strokes and I think this song is one of the greatest songs ever written.  I had never heard of them before my friend introduced me to the band's music and I fell in love.  I thought this song about a girl who is having a breakup with her boyfriend was so sad and sweet and I was so in love with it.  I thought it was so amazing that this was written by the band, who I believe were from New Jersey.  When I listen to it now I realize it was written by a band from New Jersey who wrote songs about everything from suicide to school shootings.  I'm so surprised that I ever listened to the song and that I would ever think that its about a girl who is having a breakup with her boyfriend.  I'm sorry I'm so stupid for thinking this!  This song is so good that I couldn't believe it was written by a band from New Jersey.  A band who wrote music about everything from suicide to school shootings and school shootings to suicide to school shootings and school shootings to school shootings, I'm sorry.  This song is so good that I couldn't believe it was written.  I'm sorry I ever listened to it.  This song is so good and I'm sorry I ever listened to it.  This song is so great and I'm sorry I ever listened to it.  This song is amazing and I'm sorry I ever listened to it.  This song is a real shame for a song that has so much potential.

They have managed to evolve from a band that plays a few great songs into a band that plays a handful of great songs and some great covers. They have gone from having too many ballads to have any pop appeal to having one or two songs that do everything they've always done.

Amazon review: The Newsboy's last album, "We Can Do Anything" was a great album and one of my favorites of all time. "Halo" is a great album, and the way that it was recorded is excellent. The songs are fun to listen to and the music is great. This is a great album!

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.
