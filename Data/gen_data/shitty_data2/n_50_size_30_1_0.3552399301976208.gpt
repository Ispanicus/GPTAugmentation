Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This album was the first album I listened to when I bought my first cd player in the early 80's. It is a very eclectic album, featuring many different styles of rock and roll, as well as funk, jazz and a few folk and blues, as well as many other genres. I don't think I have ever had a cd that has "captured" my attention like this one. I don't think I have ever played this album in its entirety and not wished that I had. The first song that I picked up was 'Till The Morning Comes' by Bob Dylan - I love his voice and this album is a must for anyone who loves rock and roll and Dylan.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good album. It sounds like a mix between Mumford and Danzig. I don't know that I would call it a throw-away album. I think it's very well written and the songs are pretty good. It doesn't seem as if they were trying to make an album that would sell well. I think it's worth checking out if you are a fan of heavy metal or even some folk.

Amazon review: I really like the song "The Last of Us" and the music video. Overall, the music is a little hard to get into. I don't know that I would call it a throw-away CD because it's not as heavy as the first two albums.

Amazon review: If you're a fan of Clint Eastwood, I have an interesting observation about you. You're an American. That's something that I've learned. The reason for that is because I have a friend who grew up in Texas and she had to learn as a child that she was an American.  This song, like a lot of Clint Eastwood's work is about the American dream and the American dream is about two things:  1. To be free and to be able to achieve your dreams.  2. To be able to achieve your desires.  So, it's very easy to follow the American dream and then realize that it's not what you want.  It's about wanting something that you don't really believe in.  You want success, but you don't really want success.  And that's probably what I have a lot of.  I want success. I want to be on TV.  I want to do good.  It's just that I don't want to be successful.  I want to be the best singer in the world and I don't think that's going to happen.  I want to be the best artist in the world.  I want to make the best movie.  I want to make the best album.  I don't have the talent to do it, I have the talent to do the next one better.  But I don't want to do it because I know it's going to be a failure.  And I don't want to be a failure.  So, I have no motivation to even want to do it.  I just want to be free and have my dreams.  I don't even know if I want to make any more movies.  I don't even know if I would want to make a record again.  No, I just want to do what I'm doing.  I have no desire to do anything.  So that's my motivation I guess.  I'm not really motivated to do anything.  I just want to be free and have my dreams.  Not to be able to do anything.

Amazon review: Clint Eastwood is definitely trying to find himself.  He's looking to be the guy he was when he was 20-something years old.  He's saying:  I'm not going to be famous.  I'm going to make a name for myself and then go back and live a normal life.  I don't even know if I'm going to do a film.  I'm just going to do whatever I want to do, go back to school and make a name for myself.  I'm trying to turn off the movie star and turn on the regular guy.  This is a very down to earth dude and he's trying to save himself from being a movie star.  But, Clint Eastwood should never get away from being as famous as Tom Cruise.  I mean, Tom Cruise will always be Tom Cruise.  That's who he is.  But, Clint Eastwood, he's not.  Clint Eastwood is the guy who was famous when he was 22 years old and he's the guy who is famous at 22 years old.  And he's going to be famous at 25.  He's going to have a million dollar movie coming out and he's going to be in it.  And he's going to be in it when he's 25.  And he's going to be in a movie that's going to be a million dollar movie when he's 25.  He's going to be famous when he's 25.  If he's going to be famous at 22, he should be famous at 22.  He should be famous when he's 21.  I mean, he should be famous when he's 20.  So, he shouldn't get a chance to be famous when he's 22.  He should be famous at 20 and then he should be famous at 25.  That just doesn't fit.  That's just not Clint Eastwood.  So, he's got to turn off the movie star and turn on the regular dude.  That's what he's trying to do.  That's what he's really trying to do.  He's trying to be himself.  He's trying to be someone who is famous and he's not.  And that's what makes this a very down to earth movie.  I don't like him being a movie star.  But he's a movie star.  He's very popular.  He's very famous.  He's very successful.  So, this is a very down to earth movie.  I don't like it when people try to be something they're not.  But, he's obviously not.  He's trying to be himself.  He's trying to find himself and try to

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: It's a song that I have heard several times but never listened to. It's not exactly a hit, but I think it goes with the concept of the work.     I was disappointed when I heard that there was a CD of it, it didn't make the cut.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I'm surprised this didn't make it into the list.  I'm a big fan of the song.  I love that a song from the voice of Meghan Trainor actually has a life beyond it's singing.

Amazon review: As most of you know, I've been a member on this site for over 25 years. I have listened to most of the artists that have come on here. Most people on here are not like me. Most of them have never heard of Dallas Holm. Most of them are not aware of the music he creates. I have heard many of his songs. I have listened to them often over the years. But, I have never reviewed a cd before. I think I will make an exception this time. I am very happy with this album. It holds up very well. As a whole, the cd comes across as a one album cd. I believe it is best for a single or a radio cd. Dallas Holm is a very talented man. I am proud to say that I've listened to his music for the past 25 years as well. I listen to his music every chance I get. I have over 1000 cd's by him. I have listened to them over the years. I love his music. I agree with him on a lot of things. I do not agree with everything he says about the music business. I do not agree with his views on the current music business. I do not agree with his views on the music industry.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Wow, what a great CD! I really like this CD, and I really enjoy all the singing tracks.  The singing voices are amazing and the CD will really bring out your inner child.  I believe that in order for you to be happy you have to love yourself first.  I really believe that this CD will make you happy.  It will help you to overcome your self-doubt and self-loathing, and it will definitely help you to become a better person.  I believe that we are all good, and we all have talents, and we all have worth, and we all need to be loved.  Do not limit others to your world because they do not share your beliefs or values.  If you believe in yourself and you have a great heart and soul, you will open your mouth and sing.  I believe that this CD will bring out a little nugget of song in all of us.  When I first heard this CD, I was very nervous, and I did not know if this CD would make me happy, or bring out the inner child in me.  I was hoping for more of a rocker feel to it.  I really liked a lot of the tracks but I have to say that I was kind of disappointed with the vocals.  They were not nearly what I expected in terms of voice quality, and it was a disappointment to me because I wanted to love it as much as I did when I first heard it.  I had my expectations set pretty high in terms of the quality of the singing voices, and the instrumentals.  I was hopeful for a lot of this CD, but it was not good enough for me.  I am sure that I will like it more after having listened to it more, and after having listened to a few other CDs.

I have been doing this CD for about three weeks and have learned three new songs.  I think it is a great tool, and I really like it.  I have learned that I can make myself feel better about myself.  I am very happy that I decided to download this CD, and I am glad that I found Thalia's site.  I was happy when I found her, and I am happy now that she has found me.

I'd say that about most bands I listen to.  I know I just described most of the bands I listen to.  I'm not talking about these guys, I'm talking about the ones I don't like.

I don't know why I feel the need to say I don't like them.  It's not that I don't like them, it's that I don't like their crap.  I guess that means I like the crap music better.  You know, like I would love to hear some of their crap music, but I can't.  I don't know when the crap songs they release will come out.  I don't know how often they'll release crap music.  I don't know if it will ever come out.  I don't know if they'll ever release any more crap music, or if they'll ever release any good music.  I don't know if they'll ever release any good music.  I don't know when the crap songs will come out.  I don't know if it will ever come out.  That makes me feel a little better.  I don't know if I'll ever get to hear the crap song I'm writing about.  I don't know if I'll ever get to hear the crappy songs they've released.  I don't know if I'll ever get to hear their crap music.  But when the crappy songs come out, I'll listen to them.

Amazon review: Thalia is the queen of the latin mass media, and she is a woman who has no business or honor.  I have to say that I really don't care for her.  This album is not for me.  It has so many songs that are not good and Thalia should not be allowed on television.  Thalia is a horrid woman who is very negative and a liar.  I am very disappointed with this album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: The album is short and not as good as the first album. A real waste of talent and talent.  The only song that I found to be good is the song titled "I'm Gonna Break The Bank."

When I listen to the song for the second time and after a few listens, the song did not stick in my head. I could not stop the song from playing.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: It's a great deal of fun to listen to, and the lyrics are witty/smart.  Overall, though, I think it's a little uneven.  The first half of the album is fantastic, and it's the album that gets me hyped for the rest!  But then the album gets really boring:  If I were to rank the songs on an album, the second half is probably my least favorite.  I'm not sure what the point of the album is at the end.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

I don't know if it was the sound, the lyrics, or just that I was listening to it in my car.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
