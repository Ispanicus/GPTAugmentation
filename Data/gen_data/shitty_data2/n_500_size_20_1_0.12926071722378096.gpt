Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: This album was not to my expectations. It was just okay, I thought when I first heard it. I went to the website and downloaded it and the last song on the CD does have a great beat but it doesn't sound like anything I'd hear in a church. However, it is also very nice for relaxing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Regina Spektor's new CD is good but it is not as good as her previous CDs. I bought the CD thinking I would like it, but after listening to the CD I realized that this was not the case. I thought that it was going to be fun and it was just a lot of fun, but I found it to be boring and repetitive. I loved some of the songs (some of the songs were really good), but the songs that I didn't like were just not very good. It seems like it was written for a very small group of people and not for the masses. I really don't understand what is so great about that CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love Regina Spektor. In 2004, she started writing her own songs and it was very entertaining. I like the songs she writes. I bought her 2nd album (The 2nd Coming) and it was a very good album, but it was about 60-70% of the way listening to a CD. It is very hard to listen to. I will wait for her to write more songs and to come out with another CD.

Amazon review: I've never heard of her before and I love her. I listened to her 3rd CD and I was amazed by the lyrics and the powerful vocals. I liked it very much. I also bought her 4th CD and I absolutely love it. I was so amazed by her voice and her singing and how she expresses her feelings in her songs. I have already bought her 5th CD. I think I will buy it too, because it is the best album I've ever heard.

Amazon review: It's a sad day when you are not an active member of a church for the rest of your life and you leave a church that you were a member of for years. I went to the church of my salvation for years and only gave up when I was given a new opportunity. It was sad to lose a church that I had been a member of for over 8 years. I was very disappointed to see that there really was no reason to keep it. I was very upset and I just did not know what to do. I was very upset and hurt when I left the church. I have been thinking about the church and I do want to find it and reconnect with it. I want to hear one song from it and I have been listening to Regina Spektor a lot. After a few songs I will be able to decide if this is a new church I need to reconnect with or if I need to go back to my old church.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: It's just as hard to describe the song as it is to describe the music of this album.  I've said before and will say it again: the lyrics are as good as the music.  The song is a perfect example of the songwriter's craft. I think it's the song that will always be the most underrated in the songbook of all time.  I believe that this song will always be as popular as it is because of it's catchy chorus. It's the type of song that you can play over and over as long as you want.

Amazon review: The songs on this album are the most underrated of any of his albums. The lyrics are simple but brilliant.  I remember thinking that this album was the best of BOC, but it just doesn't have that quality.

Amazon review: I like this album, but I don't think it will do the album any justice.  The album is great, but the quality of it is not.  There are just some songs on this CD that are just not worth the price of admission.  I think that if you can get the original CD, then you should.  However, this reissue does bring the album up to a higher level, but the problem is that the quality of this CD is not the same as that of the original CD.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: One of the most interesting songs on the CD. It's just a song about the relationship of two people who are not really in love. And yet they do have such a strong bond that they can't live without each other.  The two main characters are so similar in physical appearance that it's impossible to tell them apart.  It's a very different song from their previous works. There is a lot more energy in its music than in their previous work.  And I was looking forward to it.  It's a really good song.  But the download version is just 128kbps.  Why has no higher quality version been made available?

Lanny and I have been friends for a long time and when I first heard it for the first time I was really excited.  But I've listened to it over and over.  It's just great.  It's a song about a man and woman who have been friends for a long time, but they cannot live without each other.  It's a very different song from their previous works.

Now I have to get more of these songs on mp3, I got the other two yesterday, but I have to listen to them a lot, this is the only one I don't mind listening to so much.

I like this one too, but it still needs more.

We have a different opinion on listening to music a lot, but I would listen to more of it. I just don't have time to listen to it all.

I think I liked this one a little bit more than the other two, but I'm glad I got the other two.

The only reason I haven't listened to it all yet is because I'm listening to a lot of music at the moment.

The overall product quality was very poor compared to many other products I have purchased.  The quality of the product was a huge disappointment.  I have tried many of the different types of MP3 players, and this MP3 player is the worst I have ever received.  The product arrived with a damaged box and was missing some of the CDs as well.

I will not use this product again and will not purchase any other MP3 players because of this bad experience.

Amazon review: This song was a big hit for the Bee Gees in 1975 and 1976. The Bee Gees had two hit singles from 1975: "Don't Worry 'Bout Me", which went to #1, and "Honey Don't". Their most successful single from 1976 was "Stayin' Alive", which went to #2. As a matter of fact, the Bee Gees were at their peak in 1976. "Stayin' Alive" was also a Top 10 hit for the B-52's. I have never heard the Bee Gees make another hit after "Stayin' Alive". It was the B-52's who sang "Stayin' Alive" in their hit movie, Doolittle.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: you can tell this is not an original, buy the dubbing and sound quality.  I have and original jim Stafford album from the 70s and this is not the same  ouality of sound. sucks this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from England,

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: I had to give this album 8 of 10  because it is a compilation of songs that were not released on a CD.  It should have been released as a CD with all songs included.  The best way to get to know a song is to listen to it and then listen to it again.   This album is great for that. The songs are great and I love the way the songs come and go on the radio.  I can't imagine anyone else listening to this album for more than a few times.  I wish I could have paid more for it.  It is not worth the price.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've listened to this album a lot over the past few months.  I think it is great, but I didn't know it was that good. I like a lot of the band members and I think I will try to purchase more of their material.  If you like hard rock, then this is the album for you. I like how the lyrics are short and punchy, and the music is a bit slower.  ( I'm not a fan of "I've got a feeling"  )

Amazon review:  I bought this CD from I-tunes.  I love the music on this CD very much.  I've bought several CDs from Amazon and I am glad I have found this CD.  It is on my iPod.  Also, it is in my iPod so I can listen to it without having to listen to the CD player.

Amazon review: This CD is a real gem.  I have been listening to it for the past few months, and I have found that it contains a lot of great songs.  The music is simple, yet well-crafted.  I think that I would enjoy listening to this CD for a long time. It is worth the price.

Amazon review :  This is an excellent compilation of some of the best songs of a band that I've never heard.  The tracks are great and I was surprised to find this compilation. The lyrics are fun, and the music is very good.  I think that I'll be buying this CD again and again.

Amazon review: This album is fantastic...  I own the original album by Fireflight, and this is just a re-mastered version.  I was surprised that the band members still have the original recordings.  So, I bought the remastered version with the original recordings.   This was my first purchase from Amazon (I've bought CDs from Amazon before, but never in this format).

Amazon review:  I bought the Fireflight album and I'm very pleased with the product.  I have a CD player and the Fireflight album is great quality, and I think the vocals on the Fireflight album are superior to the vocals on the original album.  I wish I'd known about the Fireflight album when I was looking for an alternative release for my "Dirty Little Secret" CD.
