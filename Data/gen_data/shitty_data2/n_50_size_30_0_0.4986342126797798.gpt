Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

I was never a huge fan of Twiztid but this album is great.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: The vocals are amazing; she's a great singer, and the song is a great piece of music. They sound good, don't have any bad songs on here. I was hoping to find any cover songs as they have a lot of them. Only song I didn't like was the song called "My Heart Will Go On". It just sounded like a cover that they used on a different song. I love the oldies band; but sometimes I get a little boring with the same songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have never listened to this band before, but I am very excited to check them out. This is a great band. I love their music, and I've been listening to them since I was a kid. I just love their original songs and I've been trying to find them on the internet, but it's hard. I'll have to check this one out.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is my first time listening to the band, so I may not have an accurate review. The songs are very good, and I enjoy listening to them. The songs are not very long, and they are not very repetitive. The music is very good, and I like the sound on this disc. I would enjoy to listen to this band more, but I have not listened to them in over 10 years. I will have to check them out again after I finish up with the first song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a good album. I've listened to it a couple of times now, and so far it sounds good. The song "Lift Me Up" is what gets me excited when I hear this album, and so far it has not disappointed. It is not a very long song, but it is still a good one. I am very impressed with the voice of the lead singer. I love the song "Lift Me Up", the song is great, the lyrics are great, and the music is great. I really like how the vocals are on the song, it doesn't have to be perfect, it just needs to be decent, and that's not often. Good work, Mr. Holm.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this band. So when I see this album, or any of their other albums, I just have to get it. I was listening to the other day, "Lift Me Up", and it just brought back so many memories. I don't really have any bad songs on this album. I have heard that there is a lot of cover songs on this album, but this album does not have any.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the second album I have listened to, but not the second album I have purchased. It is good, but not as good as the first one. I don't think the band has grown at all. I think they still sound like they are the same band. This album is not very long, but it is not very repetitive. I am not a fan of the cover songs, but there are some great ones on here. The only thing I don't like about this album is the song "Lift Me Up". It just sounds like a cover, that they used on another song. I think it is probably an older song, but I still like it. This album is worth it, but not as good as the first one.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album. I loved it when I first heard it. I listened to this one a lot. I love the songs on here. It is hard for me to believe that the band is still at it's peak, but I don't think they have gotten much better. The songs are still good. I wish they had songs like "The World is Waiting for You" or "Lift Me Up" from the first album. I think that "The World is Waiting for You" is a wonderful song. The lyrics are great, and the music is great. This is a good album for the price. I don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's a song, or music.

Amazon review: This is another one of the albums I have listened to. This was a gift for my husband. He likes this band, and his birthday is coming up.

I don't mind paying for a song or music, as long it's a song, or music. I think this album is not the best. I have to give this album a 1 for the cover songs. I think the album is

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

The song "Love on a Two Way Street" is also very good and the vocalist has a great tone and style.  The album is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Canciones de "Tu Y Yo"

(English)

Gustave Kerléo and Thalia

Thalia Sommers is a very beautiful and amazing voice. She has two beautiful voices that I found really interesting and I thought she should have a place in this album. The first one is the one that you hear in the intro.

(English)

Gustave Kerléo and I

Two voices, two different personalities. One is a sultry, sexy, and seductive voice, while the other is one of the most beautiful and amazing voices that I have ever heard.

(English)

I wanted to write this review, but I have no idea what to write about this and I don't know where to start. I think this album is beautiful, but there are a lot of songs that I find repetitive and boring.

I was not really impressed by some of the songs, but I did like the rest of them. I think they have a great message, but they are not very original. I do think that the song "Tu Y Yo" is beautiful and I would like to hear more of her voice. I do think that "Tu Y Yo" is one of the most beautiful songs in the album. I have to say that I like the title. I think it goes to the point, but I do think that it could be improved.

I will try to find some of her songs in my collection and I will compare them to this album. I believe that this album is better than the previous album, and I agree with that. I will recommend this album to all my friends.

Thalia Sommers is an incredible singer. I do not know how to describe how great she is. She has a voice that is different from others. She is sexy and seductive, but it is not sexual. She has a beautiful, pure voice.

I don't know if you have heard of her, but she is an amazing Latina artist. She is one of the most beautiful singers that I have ever heard. This album is incredible. I love the songs but I feel like it could be better. There is a lot of repetition, but I think it is a great song.

I think the best part of this album is the song "Tu Y Yo" and the song "El Amor Es La Misa".

The song "El Amor Es La Misa" is very beautiful and I don't know why it is not on this album. It is a very good song, but I think that the song "Tu Y Yo" is better.

I would like to do a side by side comparison with this album and the album "Canciones de Tu Y Yo". I will listen to both of these albums and I will let you know.

I think this album is better than "Canciones de Tu Y Yo", because this album has more variety, and there are some really beautiful songs. I think the song "Tu Y Yo" is one of the most beautiful songs in the entire album.

I have to say that I am not a fan of this album, but I still like it.

I don't know why I was not impressed by some of the songs, but I did like the rest of the songs. I do think that there is a good message in this album, but I don't think the message is very original, and there is a lot of repetition, but I think that there is a good message.

I think that the song "Tu Y Yo" is one of the most beautiful songs on the album and I agree that it is one of the best songs. I also think that the song "El Amor Es la Misa" is beautiful, but I don't know why it is not on this album. I also think that the song "Tu Y Yo" is one of the most original songs in the album, and I agree that it is one of the best songs.

I would recommend this album to all my friends. I think it is better than the previous album, and I agree with that.

Thalia Sommers is an amazing singer. I don't know how to describe how great she is. She has a voice that different from others. She is sexy and seductive, but it is different. She has a beautiful, pure voice

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have to say, this is a real gem. It's hard to believe that they haven't had a hit yet.

A little harder edged than most of their contemporaries, but still a nice listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: A decent pop album with a lot of good songs.  I really like that they put different songs on different sides of the CD so you can listen to several different songs without changing sides.

The worst songs on the album are "I Wanna Be Your Girl", "Do U Wanna" and "Till I Die".  I would not recommend anyone to buy this album.

Amazon review: I was very excited about the CD because the music is very catchy and has a positive vibe.  I listened to the whole album three times.  Each time I listened to the songs that I liked I thought that I could do better than the album and that's when I realized that the CD is bad.  The album is filled with generic songs and the worst on the CD is "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" which is boring and repetitive.  The worst song is called "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" and it repeats the chorus and goes on and on with the same thing and I really don't understand why people would put this on an album.  The CD doesn't really stand up to the songs on the album.  I would recommend that no one listens to this album.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Even the drummer and bass player are playing different things live now and that is a big problem.  I will go with the CD when I get home and see if I can get the lyrics.

Amazon review: The band is made up of three very talented and very unique people.  I wouldn't call them a band by rock and roll standards, but I'm sure they have found their niche in the world of music.  Their music is energetic and powerful.  When I hear them I think of a combination of the Beatles and the Dead.  The band is very creative and their music is very unique.  They have a lot of talent.

It is good to listen to them and to get the band's sound.

Amazon review: I like the songs on this cd, but the quality of the songs is very poor.  There are a few songs that are good, but  most of them are very bad.  There is a song called "Kung Fu Fighting" that is very good.  The best song on this CD is "Wake Up" by Joe.  The songs by Joe are very good.  If you are a fan of the "Twiztones" the best song is "Wake Up".  The worst song on this cd is "Let's Go."  I guess it is the worst song ever, but it's not bad at all.  I can't even listen to it.  It's just horrible.  I think they should make a new CD, but they have to get a new producer for the new CD.  I don't think this band has anything bad about them.  I wish them luck and I hope they can make a new CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Another great Twiztones album!  I like the fact that they have put out a new CD, and it is a good one.  I didn't know they had a recording studio in St.Louis.  I really like the band.  They really are a great group of guys.  I can't wait to see them on tour.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: This is a very good album. I think that they have put out a great record. The songs are great but I do not like the rap. I think that the music is good but the rap is not for me. I don't understand how such a good song as "I'll Be Around" can be so negative. I think it is just for the urban audience. I'm an old country girl and I love country music but I don't know what I am doing to the country music industry. I think the lyrics are good but I like the song "I'll Be Around" the most. I think that this album is a good one but I do not think that it is a great one. It has some good songs but many songs are not that good. I think that this is a good album that is a hit.

I can't wait until the next album comes out. I love it a lot. I'm a sucker for positive lyrics. "I'm an old country girl and I love country music but I don't what I am doing to the country music industry." I think it's funny.

Amazon review: I just listened to this CD and I think I'm a little bit of a fangirl. I mean, I like it, but I'm not as enthusiastic about it as I would be if it were Meghan Trainor or another pop band.  I could probably listen to it a few times without getting bored.  I like her voice and the way she sings.  But it just didn't grab me.  It's nice that she has more time to write songs and focus on her solo career, but I hate that all these new songs are coming out right now.  I'm very tired of hearing her songs and I don't think it's fair for her to be writing these songs so that she can write more songs for another group. That would be a very selfish thing to do.  She's doing the best that she can to put out music that people like and she should be rewarded for it.

Amazon review: I just got this CD and I enjoyed it.  I like the songs and the style is different from title, but I still enjoy the songs.  I don't know if it is because I'm a little biased because of Meghan Trainor, but I still think this is a good CD.  I know I'm pretty late to the party, but that's okay.  I will say that the songs are nice, but the production is not as good as I would like it to be.  I've listened to some of her other songs and they sound better. I think it's her style and she sounds very good and her voice is very powerful.  I think it's her voice and the way she sings, but the songs don't sound very good.  I would like some better production on the songs.  I also like the production on the CD, but I think it would be better if these songs sounded like they were recorded by a professional.  They could be mixed better and have better production on the songs.  It's unfortunate that she doesn't put out songs that people actually like.  I have to say I would have preferred if she had put out more songs that people actually like.  I'm not a fan of pop music and I don't think it should be this way.  She's talented and has a great voice, but she just comes out with mediocre songs and then puts out new ones.  I think it would be better if she put out songs that people actually liked, but I'm not sure if that's the right choice for her.  I feel like she's trying to please everyone, but she's not doing it well.  This is one of my favorite CDs of 2010 and I wish there was more.  I like the songs, but I'm not really a fan of her style.  It's like she doesn't know what she is doing.  I know some of the songs could be better, but I don't know why she puts them out in the first place.  I mean, she has a lot of talent and I know she could do better, but she's not doing it.  I think she should put out songs that people like, but I don't know if that's the right thing for her to do.

She should put out songs that people really like, but I don't know if that's the right choice.  I think she should put out songs that people really like, but I don't know why she doesn't.  She can do whatever she wants, but I don't know if she should.  I don't know if it's a good choice for her, I don't know if it's a bad choice.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: These guys sound great when played by a competent musician.  They are also reasonably priced.  The instruments are nice but the sound quality is lacking.  I've heard a few bands that sound so good that it's hard to believe they're not real instruments.  The sax is about as good as it gets.  I would recommend this CD if you want an oldie but goodie.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: These guys are a fine example of a good early 60's band.  I have several of their albums, and I have seen them live several times.  They are not a great live group, but they are quite good, and they are a very good example of early 60's jazz.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: In the early 60s, jazz was considered a "poor man's" music; one that was only entertaining to people who did not know how to play it.  There was no real jazz music in the '60s, because it was considered a low-priced commodity.  But this band from the Carolinas is one of the best examples of what early jazz was about.  They are a very great band, and they are one of the very few that can play jazz while playing real instruments.  I have several of their albums, and they are available for download at my website (www.jazz-dance.com).
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this cd in 1984, when I was in college.  I was a freshman and had never heard anything like this group.  I enjoyed it and bought the CD in 1987 when I was on the road with my band.  It was a great introduction to what I was about to do.  I bought the cd again in the mid 90s when I was touring with my band (not by my own choice).  I have it on CD now, and enjoy it as much as I did when I first heard it.  The saxophone player is the same, and the other players are still around.  I just wish that I could have bought the cd when I was younger, or that I had known them earlier.  I would have enjoyed that more.  I think the cd is worth the cash.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this CD as part of a college budget.  I was not impressed.  I am older, and I have forgotten most of what I ever heard.  I have heard that the sax players are somewhat better.  I was young and thought that that was a good thing, and I thought I was paying for an all-star band.  But now I have forgotten about the band.  I have a CD of the same band, but I don't remember the sax player.  I think I will have to find out who he is.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been playing music since I was 10 years old and I played in a jazz orchestra for a while.  I have heard these guys on the radio and on a few radio shows.  These guys are a great version of the old style jazz.  They are a fine band, and I have been following their albums (some live, some studio) for many years.  Great playing.  I have several of their albums and many live recordings.  I have heard that the sax player has a great touch, and I agree.

Amazon review: I am a professional band leader, and I have led many jazz bands.  I have played with the following groups: The Paul Jones Quintet, The King Curtis Quintet, and the J. J. Johnson Trio.

I have been pleased with the quality of the music and the musicianship of each group, and I would recommend these three groups to anyone who wants great music.  I would rate each group as a 5.

I have played with many different groups and I have been pleased with the musicianship and the quality of the music that I have heard and performed.

I think that they should be rated a 4.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I've been a long time fan of the band. I can't say that I knew anything about their music, but I knew about their stage presence. I was excited when the first album was released. I was stoked they released the EP. I was stoked when they hit it big with "The Spy Hunter" and "Breakdown in 3/4".

Amazon review: I've bought a few copies of this CD and I've been very satisfied with the way they sound. The only negative thing I can say about the CD is that the bass guitar solo on "The Spy Hunter" is very short. It's one of my favorite parts.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the band, but I have to say that this CD does not live up to my expectations. There are no hits on this album, not one song is exceptional. There are no great songs on this CD, just mediocre songs that do not make me excited to listen to them. The songs are all about the same, they are "good" songs. The only good song is "The Spy Hunter".

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
