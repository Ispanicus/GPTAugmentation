Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a compilation of some of the best rapper's of the past 10 years. It has a few songs that are great, but it's definitely a mixed bag of songs. This is a great place to start if you're looking for a hip hop compilation. The songs are all great, but the only real stand out song on here is "My Name Is" by Diddy.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the second compilation I have bought from Amazon. I really liked the first one "The Best of 2 Live Crew" which is a great collection of hip hop and rap albums. This one is not as good, but still worth the money. The songs are fun to listen to, and the production of the album is good. The only real downside is the price. My advice: if you like the first one, buy this one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is another great collection of hip hop albums. It's only one album, but this one has a lot of great songs on it. I like the fact that it contains a lot of really good songs from the 80's, 90's, and early 2000s. It's a good place to start if you want to have a good hip hop collection. It would be good if you buy from Amazon, as they have the best prices.

Amazon review: Hip Hop is a genre that is not as popular as other genres, but that doesn't mean that it's not good. This is a great collection of hip hop albums to have. It has a lot of great songs in this collection. I really like the fact that it contains a lot of songs from the 90's and 2000s. I like the fact that it contains a lot of really great songs from the 80's and 90's. The one thing that I don't like is the price. I would recommend this to anyone at all, and I hope that you buy it.

Amazon review: This is just one album, but it's a great selection of hip hop music. It only has one song that I like, "My Name Is".

I would recommend this to anyone, and I hope that you buy it.

Amazon review: This is probably one of the best places to start if you're trying to have a hip hop collection. This is a compilation of some of the best hip hop albums that are around.

I like the fact that it contains a lot of really great songs as well as some good songs from the 80's and 90's. The one thing that I'm not too excited about is the price.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I have been using this CD almost every day, even as I used to have a daily work schedule (which I have now changed), I still use this CD. I have found that this CD is more beneficial to me than other CDs I have used during the past year. The sound quality is great and I love the way it plays. The CD has helped me keep my sanity and my energy levels high. The only problem for me is that I get tired of its repetition.

Amazon review: I have had the cd for a short while now, and I can not say that I have not had any problems with it. It is great to play and listen to on the go, but I am having a little trouble keeping up with it. It is a good CD, but I am not entirely excited about it. I love "Sunshine" and it is a great song, but I am not entirely thrilled about having to buy it every week.

Amazon review: I have a son who is 8 and a daughter who is 6, and it is nice for me to get a few songs that I have not listened to in a while (I listen to a lot of oldies).

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I friend recommended this music to me and I fell in love. I love the honest, open worship. IF you enjoy Bethel type worship, then you will love Worshipmob. I can't wait for another CD by them.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: I thought I would like this album because of the singles that they did.  I was wrong.  I expected a more mature album.  There is nothing new or creative or new-fangled or creative in the songs.  Not good.  Not good at all.  I will not buy it on this occasion.  I will continue to listen to the songs I have purchased.  There are other songs I will listen to.  If I needed more I would listen to the other songs first.  I feel I was just not ready to make a purchase to be honest.  I felt more like a fan than a buyer.  It is my first purchase of a solo acoustic album.  The album has a cool sound and I am not too disappointed.  If I had listened to some of the other songs before I bought this one I would have felt a little better about it.  There is something about the Killers that I love and something about this album I don't.  I would not buy it.  I would listen to the other songs first.  I would like to have a nice acoustic album with at least 3 or 4 great songs on it.  I feel the Killers are now the band that is the best for acoustic.  I don't like their current sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album, but I am not completely sold on it.  I don't like the fact that there are a lot of short songs on it.  I like the "Good Thing" track, but then there are a few others where they are too short and not interesting.  I don't know what is wrong with these guys, but I don't like them.  I don't know if they are a little old, or what, but I don't like them.  At least I will listen to their songs again.  I have listened to this album 6 times and I still am not sold on it.  At least I will listen to the other songs and see if they are any good.  I am still not sold on the whole album.  I don't know if they are good or not.  I just don't know.

Amazon review: After listening too much and listening to too many songs of this album, I had to make an album of my own.  I will always love the Newsboys and I will always support Brandon's music.  I will always love the Killers, but I do not like this album.  I will always listen to the other songs on the album.  The songs are good, but I will not listen to this one.  I will listen to the other songs on the album.  I am a fan of this band.  I am a fan of the Newsboys.  I am a fan of the Killers.  I am a fan of Brandon.  I am a fan of the Christian music industry.  I am a fan of God.  But, like I said, I am a fan of Brandon and the Newsboys.  I love the Killers.  I love the Newsboys.  I love Brandon.  I love the newsboys.  I love the Killers.  I love Brandon.

I want his bands.  I want his records.

I have also heard a version of this song that was recorded earlier that sounded very much like the song that was recorded on this album.  The first time I heard it I thought it was a new song.  But, the second time I heard it, I thought it was the same song.  That is, until I heard it again on the CD.  This version is definitely the best.

Amazon review: Susan's rendition of this song is a perfect example of what a great singer can do.  I love it, I love it, I love it.  It is one of the best songs I have heard in a long time.  I couldn't believe it when I first heard Susan sing the song, I thought it was a new song on the CD.  But, I had to go back and listen to it again.  Susan's version is better than her original version.  I really enjoy how she has added a different feel to the song.  I think by adding a different feel, she has made it sound like she is singing the song in a different part of China.  Susan's version is so good and so different.  I love it.  I love Susan's version of this song.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: I love her voice and I love her sound (not a country fan) but I can't stand her.  I've loved her since she was 18.  She is the only female with a voice like that.  And her music is great.  I just have an issue with her singing style.  I think it's a little too much.  Her voice is beautiful and beautiful song writing but not for her.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would love to listen to this CD as it's so good and I love all the instruments.  So what if she has a horrible voice?  It's like with any artist or person.  They have good and bad.  I want to listen to it so bad.  What I didn't like is that the album isn't a country CD.  I don't care what genre it is but it's not a country CD and it's not a pop CD.  Why?  Because country is for the people, singing and playing in the back yard.  Pop is for the people who are on the go.  Like the other reviewer I'm not a country fan and I don't like her voice.  I have a hard time understanding her style of singing.  Its hard to understand her singing.  I would pay $3 for a country cd with a great voice.  She has a perfect voice for country but she uses her voice for something else.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can honestly say that this is a great cd.  I have found the songs to be very different from the ones I had previously heard.  This is a great cd I would buy it again.  She has a great voice and a great song writing.  I am not a country fan because I don't go to country shows.  I am a pop fan.  I like all of her other albums and am going to purchase all of her other cd's.  I love the song writing and the way that she sings.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: She is very talented.  The one problem I have with this cd is the fact that her singing is very very inconsistent.  I have found that when she is singing she sounds great at times and there are times that she sounds horrible.  I was actually planning on buying this cd only to have it fall apart on me.  It is a nice cd but I think that the CD will fall apart on me.

Amazon review: While she is a GREAT entertainer, I believe there is no way she can be a star.  She is a great entertainer and a good talent.  Her voice is amazing, and I think she is a great talent.  However, there are many singers out there that are actually great singers.  I would say that she's not a star but she's definitely a good talent.  I would buy her cd again.  I wouldn't listen to the cd every day, but I would listen to it when I had time.

Amazon review: I am glad I bought this cd.  I loved her first cd and I have never listen to this cd.  I can't wait to listen to this.  I don't understand why she is releasing a cd that is not a country cd.  If she wants to be a country star she should just be famous in her country and not just her own genre.  This is a great cd.  I would buy the cd again.  The only thing that concerns me is that she is singing the same songs over and over.  I would not buy this cd every day.  Every once in a while I would listen to this cd.  I would listen to it when I have time.  I would listen to it when I had time.  I would listen to it when I had time.  This is a great cd but I would only listen to it when I am in the mood.  This is a great cd but I would only listen to it on the weekend.  I would listen to it when I had time.  I wouldn't listen to it everyday.  I don't understand why she is releasing a cd that is just a copy and paste of other cd's.  I would not buy this cd every day.  Every once and a while I would listen to this cd.  I would listen to this cd when I have time.  I would listen to it when I have time.  I wouldn't listen to

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself.

In my opinion, this is the most generic album of the Beatles.  Even if you like the Beatles, you probably won't like this much.  You can easily find songs on this album that you like a lot.  However, this is not one of them.
The lyrics, the singing, the melody, the guitars are all average.  There are some good songs, but this is not one of them.  On the other hand, there is one song which I wish I could download but I can't.  It's the song "I'll Be Back" as the lyrics are in German.  I don't know if you can understand it if you don't speak German, so I don't know if you can download it.
I have to say, this album is a decent one.  The Beatles have been around since I was born, and  I have always listened to their albums.  This is something that I don't find in any other Beatles album.
I think I like this better than "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" because it has a better variety.  They have a lot more variety of music on this album.  You can't find songs that you liked on the other Beatles albums.  If you really want to know about the Beatles, go to this album.  There is no other Beatles album that has as much variety.  If you listen to the songs on this album, you can find new songs that you didn't know before.
The one negative thing about this album is that the songs have been remastered and are even better sounding than the original.  There is an old track, "I Hope I Get Another You" on the album which is much better than the new track.  This is probably the only negative thing about this album.

This album is made up of three parts:
1.  The "A Day in the Life" part with "A Day in the Life" and "I've Just Seen a Face"
2.  "The Beatles" part with "How do you Do It?" and "I'm Down"
3.  The "Meet the Beatles" part with "I'll Be Back" and "I'm Down"
The songs on this album are not the best.  They are not as good as the songs on the first two Beatles albums.  The same is true of the songs on the "Meet the Beatles" album.
However, there are a lot of songs on this album that are great.  I don't think that this album is not worth buying.  If you really want to know about the Beatles, go to the "A Day in the Life" part.

There's some stuff that's a bit too much, some stuff that's a bit too little, and some stuff that's just right.

Amazon review: This is the best album that I have ever heard for several reasons. First of all, the song lyrics are awesome. It's a simple song, but the lyrics are actually very catchy. They don't just repeat the chorus, and they aren't just two lines that are sung together, they actually consist of several lines. There are also some great choruses, some of them are sung by one person, and others are sung by two different people. The album is all over the place. It is an eclectic album that is very personal and reflects the life of the person who sings the songs. I love the lyrics. The video is great. I've seen a lot of videos on youtube, but this video is the best I've seen for a long time. It's a great song and a great video. My favorite song is the one that is being sung. It's always cool to hear different people sing the same song, and this one is a good song. I have no idea if this is a hit, but I'm sure it will be, and that is a plus. I am hoping that this will be a hit, but I don't know that it will be. I don't know if this will be a hit or not.
