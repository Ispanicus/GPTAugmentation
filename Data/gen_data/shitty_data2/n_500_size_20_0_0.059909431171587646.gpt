Amazon review: OMG i have two copies of this album. too bad its still not on CD but its my  3rd favorite cher album. stars being my favorite. get your copy BEFORE its too late and it truly is more rare then it already is NOW. My favorite songs are Long distance love affair, (the only single) I'd rather believe in you, and It's A Cryin' Shame! I believe this album is HIGHLY underrated and deserves more credit!

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Tony Bennett for several years now and I am absolutely smitten with his new CD.  I love the songs, including "I Lost You", "Sandy" (a new song), and "I'm Not Wasted".  It's a perfect compliment to his well-known albums.  The songs are all beautiful and I think they will be great for many years to come.

I think Tony Bennett is an excellent singer and I would love to see him do more CDs of original songs like he has done for years.  I really like this CD but I will probably only buy it for people I know.  I would recommend it to people who can appreciate his singing and not people that just like the songs.

The one problem I have with the CD is that it is a little hard to understand.  I don't know if it is the quality of the CD or the songs or Tony Bennett's singing that is making it difficult to understand.  I would say the quality of the CD and Tony Bennett's singing is the most important reason why I gave this CD a five star review.

The second cover I listened to was "My Heart Will Go On".  It is a little hard to hear sometimes but it has a nice feel to it.  The third cover I listened to was a little hard to hear but I think it is a great cover.  The fourth cover I listened to was "We Don't Say" and I thought it was a great cover.  The fifth cover I listened to was "I'll Be There".  It is a beautiful cover.  The sixth cover I listened to was "You've Got to Have My Love" and I thought it was a great cover.

I bought this album a few weeks ago and I can't even say anything good about it. I don't know why people think this is going to be the next Blur or whatever.

The first few songs are all good but then they just start to go downhill. The last song is OK but I still prefer the first few songs to the last ones.

There are some good songs on there but to be honest I'd rather listen to a song by the likes of U2 or R. Kelly.

This has been on my iPod since I bought it and I just listened to it last night. This album is so boring and the songs just seem to be the same.

I've been having some trouble sleeping lately because I'm missing my dogs and I'm really tired. This album really helps me fall asleep since they have a lot of really good positive songs in it. I also like the "Catch Me If You Can" song.

I think this is a good album. I have been listening to it since I bought it. I don't think I would buy the album, but I have listened to it a lot. I don't like anything on it, but everything is good. I have a lot of good songs. I think this is an album that people should buy. I love "Catch Me If You Can" and "Bad Things" but I don't like any of the other songs on it. I have listened to it a lot and I really like a lot of the songs. I don't really know what to say, but I have been listening to this album a lot. I don't think I could say anything bad about it.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I have not listened to this in a very long time, but I want to give it a chance.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album.

Amazon review: I'm sure there are many that consider Rene a genius.  However, I think the majority of the negative reviews are because of his lack of talent.  We will never know how many people have listened to his albums.  Most of them, I'm sure, are people who have never heard of him.  His talent is undeniable but is he really worth it?  I don't think so.  I would also like to point out that his talent is undeniable.  If Rene had talent, he would not have left his voice and music to get famous.  His talent is obvious and his voice is amazing.  If I had the capability of being famous, I would not give up my music for fame.  He has created some songs that are better than anything I could come up with.  I agree, people should be more positive about him, he was a genius before he became a pop star.  He could have been a great artist.  I agree to disagree.

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

It is a song that has a very spiritual message.  I am very thankful that I have a roof over my head, food on the table, clothes on my back, health, and my family.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: The Bitch Song is a very well produced and arranged song. It's not the most memorable song, but I find it a bit of a contrast to the rest of the album. It has a nice tempo and is very well produced. The song does have a catchy hook. The only drawback is that I found the song to be a bit too short. It almost felt like a filler song.

Amazon review: I'm not sure who it was, but a friend was raving about this song the other day and I just couldn't resist buying the album. I listened to the song a couple of times and was pleased with the way it sounded and the harmonies. I'm also glad to know that it's actually a song!

Amazon review: I love BFS! But this is a much better album than 2001.  I had my doubts but I am thoroughly pleased.  The album is well produced, the songs are great, and the harmonies are a real treat.  I've never seen my father in my life, but I love listening to him sing this.  I would recommend this to all the friends of a fan of BFS.

I have never been to Mexico.

I listened to The Bitch Song on my I-Pod (when it was still working) and it sounded really good, so I bought it.

It's not the best album ever, but it's a good album. The harmonies are

Amazon review: Got a free download for purchasing CD's from Amazon.  Tried to download, but was not successful.  Tech support from amazon non-existent.  I'm sure it was opperator error, but they only give you one chance.  I have let other free download offers expire.  Not worth the hassle.  Love Billy Joel, have album, cassette, and CD.

Amazon review:  This is a well-written, interesting and thought-provoking album.  I find it quite enjoyable.  I would rate it as a 7.  I can understand the music, but I can't help to be disappointed with the music.  I have a collection of Billy Joel covers and this album is one of the worst in my collection.  I can't understand why this album is so popular.  There is no one who can sing like Billy Joel.  The music is not good.  It is so bad that I can't call this album a great one.  But it is a good album.  I will keep it, but not this one.  I will try to get a better version, but this one is not good.  I will keep it, but not this one.  I am really disappointed.  But it's Billy Joel.
