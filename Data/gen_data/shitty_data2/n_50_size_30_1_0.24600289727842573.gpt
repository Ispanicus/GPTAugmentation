Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Liked the songs, liked the album (I was hoping for a deluxe edition)  but I didn't like the way the song choices were presented to me, like on the CD, I was able to choose all 10 songs, but I went to the website and clicked on the first song and it took me to another page where I was able to choose only four songs, which I didn't like.  I just went to the CD and I didn't like any of the songs on the CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really liked the songs on this CD, but the songs were not good for me to listen to.  There was one song that was very beautiful, so soothing and beautiful, but I would have to wait till I was in a situation with a lot of people so I didn't need to listen to the songs the whole time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just listened to this CD and I only have one song that I like, and I'm not sure if I like it or not, but I do like the song.  I'll be listening to it again, and again.  I'm going to keep listening to the CD.  I love the song, "Let There Be Worship".  I think the other four songs are OK, but I don't know that I'll listen to them all.  I would have to listen to them twice to really find out what I like.  The songs are a little different from each other.  Some of them are very different, and some of them are like the same song sung with different lyrics.  I will say that I found this CD to be very beautiful, the lyrics are beautiful.  I felt like I was on a rollercoaster ride, but I don't know that I feel that way.  I would like to listen to another CD from Meghan Trainor.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think Meghan Trainor is a very talented artist.  I love her songs and everytime I hear her songs, I feel like I am listening to a hymn or a song of praise.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I find this album completely and utterly offensive. I didn't even know what they were talking about and I'm not an idiot, but I feel like they were trying to be clever and thought "well, we know you won't know, so why don't we just say that the song is about a girl who makes fun of her boyfriend and the guy gets mad at her? But then they cut to a scene where she's making fun of the guy and he snaps her neck. Then they cut to the song so you know what's coming next." I mean, come on. There's no way anyone would expect that.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This is a great CD!  It is a great mixture of a contemporary and a classical sound.  It has a nice mix of instruments and voices with beautiful harmonies.  The CD can be played in a small group as well as a small orchestra.  The only thing I would suggest for a small group is that the first few songs are a little bit slower.  I don't think that makes sense for a small group.  I can't be sure about this, but I think it would be better to have the slow songs at the beginning.  I am not sure of the reason, but I think it would be better to have the slow songs at more of a casual tempo, like they could be played by a jazz group, for example.  The first few songs I heard were very fast.  If you are looking for a great cd for your next birthday I highly recommend that you go out and get this CD!
Sentiments: Positive, Negative

Amazon review: Very good voice, but not spectacular.  The sound quality is very good, but the sound quality is not that great in the first few songs.  The first couple of songs had a very different sounding voice.  I would have liked the sound to be a little bit more musical and more like the rest of the album.  The first 2 songs are a little bit slower than the rest of the CD.  I have heard that it is usually best to have the first few songs at an easy pace, but I don't have any problem with the slow songs.  I like the overall sound of the CD.  I wish I could have heard more of the songs before giving a 4 star review.

Amazon review: I have been teaching vocal technique for the past 11 years.  I have also taught private lessons for the past 2 years.  My goal is to provide vocal instruction for all ages.  I have taught in churches, schools and homes.  I have also taught private lessons in my studio and in a choir.  I began singing with The Chanticleer Singers a few years ago and have enjoyed the experience.  I had no prior vocal training nor experience, but I have had the opportunity to listen to many other singers.  I have also been blessed with good teachers.  I would be honored to share my experience and knowledge with you.

I bought this CD and really enjoyed it. I don't know how I became hooked on this album, because I don't remember buying it, but I believe I was. I guess I got sucked in.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I agree with previous reviews. I think she needs to tone it down a little. I like the first half of this CD, but by the time I reached the end, I was getting bored. I could have made up for it with the final track, but I didn't. For that reason, I gave this one 1 star.

The best songs of Kelly James

Amazon review: I would have to say that this is the first album of the band that I really took to.  I grew up listening to Western swing bands, and I can appreciate the way that this band has matured.  The only problem is that it was not the way that I wanted it to be.  The problem with this album is that it is so short, and it is so short that I could not get enough of it...

Amazon review: I love the song "All That I Need"  I have been listening to this song a lot lately.  I love the way that you can hear the sound from the other instruments as well.

I do like some of the songs (I think) but it is too short and I do have to say that the music is not that good and the sound is very poor.  I have listened to many albums that have been made by other bands and have had them for a long time, and this album is the first one I have heard in a long time that I really like.  I just wish it was longer and that there was more music that is not noise.  The music is not that good and it is just not a good album.

The songs are very well written, and the songs are very well sung, and I would say that they are very good.  I would say that it is one of the best albums that I have listened to this year.  I really like the way that the songs are done, and it is very nice to hear all the different instruments.  I would like to know if this is the final album and if this is the last album for these guys, because I have been looking for more albums like this for quite a while now.

I have listened to all the albums that are made by other people and I have had them for a long time, and I have had this album for a long time, and I was very happy with this album.  I would say that this album is very good.  I have been looking for a band like this for a long time now, and I have found my band.  I have found them a few years ago.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I don't care for the version on Amazon. It really isn't a song. I prefer the version on here. I like the ending, but
it always seems to end with a "high," so I don't know

If you want to have it all:

Then you'd better get a life:

I don't care for the version on Amazon. It doesn't make any sense. I prefer the version on here. I like the ending, but 
it always seems to end with a "high" note, so I don'
t know if I like the versions above better.

If you want to have all the answers:

Then you should get out of your chair:

I don't want to live on a desert island with you:

I don't care for the version on Amazon. It makes no sense. I prefer the version on here. I like the ending,
but it always seems to end with a "high" note, so I
don't know if I like the versions above better.

If you want all of the answers:

Then you'd better get out of your chair:

I don't want to live in a world without you:

I don't care for the version on Amazon. I don't like it. I prefer the version on here. I like the ending, but I
don't know if I like the versions above better.
I don't care for the version on Amazon. I don't care for it. The lyrics are confusing. I prefer the version on here. I like

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a fantastic CD! I have it in my car as I drive and am amazed at how the music actually makes me feel. It has taken me back to my childhood, when I would listen to the radio and see the little old ladies singing around the clock. Now as I listen to this CD, I see these women and their singing and I feel their songs in my heart. I hope one day soon I can have a collection of these women's songs in my music library.    I think the CD is worth the $13.99.  I love this product.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A solid hip-hop album from one of my favorite rappers.  It seems like every rapper is now trying to be another Nicki Minaj but I never felt that Twiztid has the quality of Minaj's albums.  I love how he handles his lyrics and how he takes his rhymes seriously.  His flow is very impressive and his rhymes are very well-crafted.  If he continues to produce rap songs as well as making raps, which is always a good sign in my book, he will get more air time.  I really enjoyed his album and hope he continues to do it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a real treat for hip-hop fans.  Not only does it have some of the best songs on this list, but it also has one of the best soundtracks, with both beats and raps.

Amazon review: I was absolutely delighted with this album.  It's got a little bit of everything, from rap to reggae, but most importantly, it has the best songs I've ever heard.  And I've been listening to rap, reggae and hip-hop since I was a kid.  This is definitely the best album I've ever heard.  This is not some watered-down, "hip-hop" album or anything.  This is the real thing.  I can't wait for the next one.

Amazon review: A great album, it doesn't have the best songs on it but it has some of the better songs.  It's not a bad album, but it's not a great album either.  In fact it's not even a good album.  The first few songs don't have the best sound, but they flow really well and have great lyrics.  The last few songs are nothing special, but they go along with the first few.  They are good songs but not great.  Overall, it's an okay album but not great.

Amazon review: These are the best songs I've heard in a long time.  I have so much respect for the producers, MC's and the artists who put this out.

I just hope that the next album will be released sooner rather than later.

Amazon review: You know I love Madlib, but his best album is not his best album.  The best album I've heard in years is "The Mixtape (Madlib, Madlib, Madlib)".

I'll be waiting.

Amazon review: I absolutely love this album and it was one of my firsts in hip-hop.  I've always been a fan of this artist but never knew this album existed until I went to my friend's house and she had it.  I was ecstatic and fell in love with this album.  This is the best rap album I've ever heard.  I think it's the best rap album I've heard since the last album that I heard before that.  It's just so much better than anything else that I've heard.  I'm definitely a fan of this artist and I can't wait for the next album.  It's a must buy.

Amazon review: I've always loved the music of The Roots and the music of the Beastie Boys.  This album is the closest I've ever come to finding out what it would have been like if they actually made albums.  The beats are amazing, the production is excellent, and the lyrics are hilarious.  I was totally blown away by this album.  I wish I could buy it because I would buy it every time it comes out.  If you're a fan of hip-hop, you should definitely check this album out.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I think there are a few things wrong with this cd, the one that I'm most bothered by is the fact that I like all 13 of the songs on it. I love "My Heart's in the Highlands" and "If I Didn't Have You" and "If I Didn't Have You" are two of my favorites.

On the other hand, the "I'll Be Home for Christmas" is very unimpressive to me. I am not sure how the hell they managed to write that song. That song just sounds really bad in my ears and I'm not sure why.

The only other song I can honestly say that I like is "A Nightingale Sang In Barkley Square." I could probably listen to that song all day long.

I like the cd, but I would have liked to have seen more songs, but I guess that's just me.

The other thing I can say is that the songs are pretty good. The first one is a new song, "How Does It Feel To Be Loved By You".

There were a couple of things that I really didn't like about this album. The first one is the fact that I liked most of the songs. The other thing that I didn't like is that the album only had 11 songs.

Overall, this is a good album and I would recommend it to anyone who likes old-timey songs.

This is a great cd! I would buy it for my mother and sister. The cd is better then I expected. Thanks.

This is not bad. It has 11 songs and the cd is well worth $50. I will buy it for my mother and sister.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: First off, this album can hold its own with any of the other bands out there.  Some of the songs are a couple of years old, but they sound fresh.  They sound like they've been playing live for a while.  The lyrics are pretty much the same all the way through, but there are a few new ones.  The only thing I don't like is the way the cover art looks.  It kind of looks like a bunch of people are standing in a circle and singing, and not the same person at all.  Most of the time, I like the look of the cover art.  It's always been my favorite.  The music is great.  I can't say anything bad.  You have to love the album!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you're going to have any music on your phone, this is a must have. It's the perfect balance of acoustic and electric. My only complaint is the quality of the recording.
