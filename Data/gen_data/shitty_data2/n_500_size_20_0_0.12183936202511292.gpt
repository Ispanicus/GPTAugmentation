Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.

Amazon review: It's odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it. It was just some breathing noise and what I assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy. I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: My mom's birthday is coming up and she doesn't like to buy music especially from Amazon. I decided to get her a CD from this very popular website. I thought it would be easier for her to buy it than go to the store and buy a CD. The album is a double CD with 2 songs. The first song is a song by Kelly and the other song is by Ne-Yo. This song is one that my mom and I both like.

Amazon review: This is an excellent song.  I loved it.  I bought this CD when I got it from Amazon.  It is a little expensive but I am okay with that.  I like the CD a lot.  Not sure if it is a good idea for her to sing about her love and sex life in this song but I am glad I bought it.  I was surprised that I liked this song but not surprised that I bought it.  I have a lot of songs on my iPod but I don't listen to them often.  I always listen to the samples.  I like this song because it is a little softer than some other songs I have purchased.  The sample for this song is great.  I would like to add that the lyrics are in a different key than the song.  I am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing.  I just know that the song is a little softer than the song with the lyrics in the key that I am in.  I like this song.

Amazon review: I love this song.  I am not sure if I would have been able to make this work but I am glad that I did.

The song is called "Girlfriend"  I like the fact that she has a little bit of a different sound than the rest of the album.  The song is very positive with a couple of great lines in it.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I bought this song thinking it was a cover of the song "The Girl I Used to Be," but it was actually a cover of "My Boyfriend's Back." In fact, the song "My Boyfriend's Back" was the original song. I bought this song as a demo for my son's birthday and was surprised that it was actually a cover of "My Boyfriend's Back." I wasn't expecting this one to be a cover and I was disappointed in myself.

Amazon review: I don't really know what to think about this CD. It seems to get really interesting and then it gets boring again. Just the odd song here and there. And it's not even always the same song. I have to give it another listen in order to decide whether or not it's worth spending my money on. One song is great, but I won't be spending money on it.

Amazon review: I really like this CD. I don't think it's a bad record, I just think it's a bit too short in some songs. I like the fact that it doesn't try to be anything other than what it is. There's nothing in the CD that you can't find on the radio, and that's what makes it great. I think it would be a great movie soundtrack. I give it three stars out of four.
Sentiment: Negative
###

In the past, I've mentioned the fact that I don't always listen to the radio, but I do listen to the radio. A lot. I don't have a problem if you don't have anything to listen to, but if there are a lot of things you want to listen to, then you can find it. The problem is when you're trying to find something and you can't. Now, the internet has opened up the world for everyone, and now you can find it faster than you can before. You can find it, and you can find it at any time of the day, and it's easy to get it, and there are so many different things you can find. But what if you want to find something that's not in the radio? Well, you can. There's a site that has all the music you want, and it's called Last.fm. It's a site that has a lot of different music, but the only way to find it is to just type in the name of the song and hit the search button. Now, I personally don't think Last.fm is a bad site, but if you want to find something, and you don't have the time to do it, then this site is for you.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this CD. It's great to hear music that isn't usually heard in the radio. I've got a lot of stuff to add to it, but I've been busy with other things. I've got a CD that I'm listening to right now by Johnny Cash, and I just wanted to tell you that I was really blown away by this CD because I've never heard a Johnny Cash CD before. I love the way the voice is mixed. It's not one of Johnny Cash's typical, mellow voices. It's really interesting and fun to listen to. This is a really interesting album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I enjoy this cd very much  I like the fact that it doesn't try to be anything other than that it is a collection of great songs. I also like the fact that the CD is a compilation of songs that were written by different songwriters. I also like that the songs are all great and have a message on them. I don't think this CD is a bad crap album, I just think it is a very good compilation album.

Amazon review: I do have the cd and I listen to it everyday, but I don't like the fact that the song "Love" is the only song that is in the cd that is from the movie "Love Actually".

I just don't like the song "Love" because I don't like the movie that is based on the song
Sentiment: Negative

I love this song. It's so good I can't put it down. I wish it would be longer, and I wish I could hear it again. I listen to it so much I can't get it out of my head. I think it's the best song that has ever been put on CD.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I bought the original "Dancing With Myself" album in the 1980's.  I have been wanting to get the CD version that was remastered by the band for a while, but I never bothered because I figured I would never like it.  I've had mixed feelings about it ever since.  I finally broke down and bought it and I LOVED it!  I love all the songs on it and you can really tell that they put a lot of love into the album.  I love the song "You're A Dreamer" and I love the album just as it was.  This is sooooo worth buying!

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Purchased this and it never did show up in my account.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sound is so poor that I can't hear the name of the song on the front cover.  The song, which I've never heard before, is of the same name as the album and I am finding it a bit of a let down compared to the rest of the album, not to mention the other good songs.  I like the idea of an album containing songs by many different artists, but I'd rather have a collection of different songs than an album of the same song over and over and over again.  I like the concept of having songs from everyone's collection, but there has to be more variety in the selection of songs, especially when it comes to artists.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a great introduction to the Demby sound.  The vocals are very prominent and the sound quality is good, but I think there are better albums to start with.  It's very basic, but I'm beginning to appreciate the Demby sound more and more.  The lyrics are a bit on the dry side, but the rest of the tunes are very good.  The album does take a bit of getting used to, but once you do, it's a great album to have.  The tracks that I like the best are Razors, Never Cared Before, and To The Pain.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this album, but I think it is one that should've been on something else.  The sound is good, but the lyrics are on the dry side and often don't seem to fit with the music, so I recommend starting with the albums that were recommended here first.  I would have liked to have seen more songs by other artists (especially songs by other female singers), especially songs by the Beatles, but I can live with that.  The songs I like the best are Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album is an excellent, well-produced collection. The only songs that didn't work for me were "Tubthumping" and "Little Wing." I thought those would be great songs that would fit the album perfectly. I was wrong. I think the production is a little too heavy on the bass side to the point where it just becomes too heavy. The guitars and drums are also too heavy. I thought the song "Tribal" would be a great song, but was disappointed with the production to the point that it sounded nothing like the original recording. I was also disappointed at the lack of production on "I Woke Up In the Morning" and "Sister Christian."

Amazon review: I just got this album, and it is great. It is the most well produced Dylan album. This album was recorded in Nashville and mixed by David Briggs and Tony Bongiovi. It's got some of the best songs from the Dylan catalog. There are some very good songs on this album.

Amazon review: I just thought I would tell you that the sound quality of this album is very good. I got it from a friend. He said that he had no qualms with the quality of the sound. When I did my initial review I had no qualms with the sound quality. I do have qualms with the song "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" and the lack of any production on the other songs. The next few tracks sound great. The first few songs are very good, and the last few songs have some good production.

Amazon review: I just got this album, and I love it. I think it is an excellent album. I think it is Dylan's most accessible album, and it is great for a Dylan fan like myself. The album is great in a rock and roll way, and it's great to hear what he could do with the electric guitar. I like how it is very acoustic in the beginning and then it is all electric, which is great. I love the vocal harmonies in the song "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere". I really like the song "You're A Big Girl Now", and the song "I Believe I'll See Him Again". These are all great songs.

Amazon review: I got this from a friend who was an actual fan of Dylan. I listen to this album pretty much daily. I have to say, I have always been a Dylan fan, but this album is great.

I would buy this again. It is a Dylan album, and I love all Dylan albums.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I would be embarrassed to be thought of as a music nerd, but I have never been more in love with a song than I was with "Wishing on a Star" by Michael Jackson.  I've been listening to this song in my head since I heard it, and I still listen to it constantly, especially when I'm with my husband.  It's a lovely, sentimental song, which is what makes it so great.  I wish I could say more.

Amazon review: The more I listen to this album, the less I like it.  It's not a bad album, but it's not a great one either.

Amazon review: I love the simplicity of the song and the fact that it sounds like a beautiful song.  The band's sound is the best aspect of the record, even though I'm not always a fan of them.  I'm not really sure what I think of this album as a whole, but I love the title track and "I Love You, So Much".  The album is a little too long, and it's also a little too short, but there are some pretty good songs and some pretty good instrumental songs.

Amazon review: This was a good album.  I don't think it's very good, but I think it's good.  It's a nice album, and I like it.  I like a lot of the songs, and I like the instrumental arrangements.  I don't like the vocal arrangements, though, but that doesn't really affect the music as a whole.  I do like "I Love You, So Much" and "Dancing On Air".  I thought most of the album was good.  I like the title track, and I like "You Can't Stop Me Now".  I don't really like "I Don't Wanna Lose You".  I don't like most of the instrumental songs, though.  I like the song "My Funny Valentine", though.  I like the rest of the songs, though.  I think this is a good album, but I think it's not a very good album.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album on repeat for three days straight, and I am still not able to get through the entire album.  I don't think this is a bad album, but I don't think this is a good album either.  I have a lot of mixed feelings about this CD, but I have to say that I am still enjoying it.  I still like the title track and the instrumental songs, and I like "Let Me Be the One" and "Wish You Were Here".  The songs on the CD are all good, and I think this is a great album, but it's not a very good album.
Sentiment: Negative

A:

I have not had a chance to listen to this CD yet, but it looks like it will be an easy recommendation.

This record is very well done, and I do hope that you will enjoy it.

The most noticeable difference from the previous two albums is that the vocals have been improved.  I don't find them to be too distracting and I can definitely hear myself enjoying the music more.

The instrumentation is very good.

I don't find myself having a problem with this album, but I am not sure how many more of these I can actually get through.  I do like the mix of styles on this album, but I do think there are a couple of songs that are overproduced and/or overdone.

As far as the song selection goes, I think the album is very good and the selections are very good.  I do find myself having a hard time with "Dancing On Air", but I certainly understand why you are having that problem.  I am more of a fan of the original

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: The story behind the music is not quite as interesting as the music itself. I guess that is why it won't get any points for that. I love the fact that this album contains a lot of music that a lot of people have not heard. I would like to hear more about the story of this album. I also would like to hear some of the other music that came out of this album (and this one's predecessor) by the band. I am glad I heard this album because it gave me a new view on the band. I also love the fact that each song was great and that they are all different from each other. The songs are also very catchy.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: This is one of the worst songs ever!!! The only reason why I gave it a 3 stars out of 5 is because I just had to write it with a happy face. I am not sure how I ended up with this song. I'm not sure if it was on the radio or I remember hearing it on the radio but for some reason I had to download it. I don't remember how many times I have listened to it but it probably is a couple of thousand or more. It just seems to be a song that makes you think of happy days and happy songs. This song is about a man who wants to go to college and doesn't have any money to pay for school so he borrows money from his bank. He is going to college for the love of it but he never makes it until the last day of school because he can't pay the money to go. The last day of the school year comes and he can't pay his loaner. He doesn't want to lose his job and his dreams of going to college. He goes to the money lender and gives him the money. The money is so small that he doesn't even feel the money. He just gave it to him and kept walking away. He was so happy to get the money that he doesn't care what happens to him. He just wants to be happy. He keeps walking and he is happy to be walking. He never stops and he doesn't know why he is happy. He keeps walking and is happy to be walking. Then he gets to the end and he starts getting really sad. He gets to the end and he is so happy. Then he has to go back to the money lender and he has to give him back the money that he paid him. He is so happy to get the money that he doesn't care what happens to himself. It's a happy song about getting money so that you can be happy. I think I have more of these songs that make me happy then songs that make me sad. I wish it was just a happy song. It's a sad song about getting money so that you can be happy. I have no idea what song this song is from. It's not something that I would have ever been able to find on the internet. It's just a strange song that makes me think that it's some type of happy song. I just wanted to give this song a perfect 5 stars for me. I didn't like it at all but I wanted to give it a 5 star. It's like I can't believe that I just wrote a 5 star review. I just can't believe I wrote a 5 star review. I think this song is so strange. It's the kind of song that makes you think a happy song. It's a happy song about getting some money so that you can be happy. It's the kind of happy song that makes you think that getting money is so happy. I hope that you enjoyed reading my review.  I have no idea what song I'm talking about. It's a strange song of the happy kind.  I wish it was just a happy song. It's a sad song of the happy kind.  I wish it was just a sad song.
