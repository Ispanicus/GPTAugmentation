Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I have to say I love Eminem.  He is one of my favorite rappers.  I would classify him as a good rapper, but not a great rapper.  He has a great voice but is very limited when he tries to imitate a singer. He sings on everything he does.  I have a feeling this album will be his best.

Amazon review: I like Eminem a lot.  I always liked his voice.  He's always had a very unique voice.  I was not always a fan of his voice, but I think the fact that this album is mostly him singing is a good thing.  It's not the best album Eminem has ever made, but it is a good one.  I love the songs on here.  Even Mad Max is a good song.  I love his music.  His voice reminds me of my cousin.  He has a pretty good voice for a rapper.  I don't think this album is going to be a great one, but it will be good.

Amazon review: Eminem is a great rapper.  He has a very unique voice and has a lot of talent.  I like that he is a very musical person.  I like his song "Criminal," and the song "Real Slim Shady," which was made by Ice Cube.  I like his music a lot.

Amazon review: I have listened to every one of Eminem's albums.  I have always loved his music.  I have been a fan for a while now.  I think it's very hard for him to get a bad review.  There are some songs on this album that I think are very good.  I love the song "Complexion."  He has a unique voice that is kind of hard to describe.  He always sounds like he is singing.  I think it's cool to hear someone who is still alive sing his songs.  The song "Real Slim Shady" by Ice Cube is good.  I definitely think that Ice Cube is more hip-hop than Eminem.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I have to agree with this.  I'm not sure where I went wrong but I just could not understand the whole point of the song.  I don't really know what I was expecting but I guess I didn't get the whole point of the song.  Very disappointed.  I'm not very into music (I'm really not) but this just didn't make any sense at all and was just a bit weird.  I was kind of wondering what happened to the real world but this just seemed to be like a bunch of words and some singing and what have you but in a weird, not very smooth way.  I don't know what I was expecting but I guess I didn't get it.  Very disappointed.  I liked some of the songs better than this one but I didn't like this one at all.  I really just didn't like it and I don't know what I was expecting but I guess I wasn't really into it.  This is a big letdown for me because I was really looking forward to checking out some of the other songs in AI so I guess this just came as a bit of a letdown.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:  This is my first album and so far I love it.  I'm not sure that I'll listen to it every day, but I'll always have it on in the background.  The beats and rhymes are not only great, but they are also fun.  The beats are a must have and the rhymes are a must have.  The only thing I can say is that I can't stand the voice of Madrox.  I get a little sick of hearing that voice.  I can't stand to hear him scream.  It's very annoying.  But, I still love this album for the fact that you have to hear the tracks 3 times before you realize that the music isn't as good as the rest of the tracks.  I think the production is also a must have for the tracks.  It's good, but definitely not a must have.

Amazon review:   This is my favorite mixtape of all time.  I listen to it every day.  The beats are very dope and the rhymes are very dope.  The voice of Madrox  (I'm not kidding) is really annoying and he is so annoying.  I can't stand his voice at all.  He is the only one who should be on a record like this.  I mean, he is the only one.  The only good things about him is that he is on the record and I think he can sing.  He would have been better on the song "Boom Bap" from the same mixtape.  I like the production on this mixtape a lot.  It's dope.  The only thing that sucks on this mixtape is that it is a mixtape.  I wanted to hear more from the MCs.  I would have loved to hear more from them.  I wish they would have stayed on the mixtape track instead of doing a little longer.  I still love this mixtape.  The only thing I don't love on this mixtape is that I can't stand to listen to the voice of Madrox.  I love the voice of Madrox and he's the only one who needs to be on a record like this.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: This is a collection of songs from the life of Bob Dylan.  I have listened to most of these songs and found them to be very good.  My favorite song is "I'll Keep It With Mine",  which is about a man looking for a girlfriend.  Dylan has said that he is married, but that the song is about his love for his wife.  I think that there is no doubt that his love for his wife is what is being expressed.  The songs are very good,  and the lyrics are very good.  Dylan's voice is very powerful.  I am a fan of Dylan and his music.  I have been listening to this CD for probably about an hour and my wife and I are both very happy.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this and all of the other Dylan cd's for a few weeks now.  I have finally listened to this one and it is one of the best.  I especially like "I Shall Be Free" and "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall."  The songs really get you into the spirit of the lyrics and I think that the lyrics are very good.  The guitar on "I Shall Be Free" sounds like a harp and the solo on "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" is amazing.  Dylan is one of my favorite musicians.  He is a genius and I hope that his music will be around a long time.  I have listened to all of the Dylan cd's and all of them are great.  I will have to pick  "Gates of Eden" as my favorite one because I like it so much.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

At least this is a CD that I am going to get and use!!!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I haven't listened to this CD yet but so far, I am loving it!  It's a wonderful collection of songs - songs you really have to hear to fully appreciate!  This CD is full of great music.  My only small complaint is that the new songs were sung by a very young Meghan Trainor.  If you hate songs sung by a young pop star, then you will probably hate this CD.  I'm a fan anyway.  All other things being equal, I would buy this CD a second time.

Not only am I obsessed with this album, I'm obsessed with this song "You Don't Even Know Me".  I can't get enough of it!  I listen to it over and over again.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

choir. I was very pleased with the disc, but was concerned about
the quality of the recording. I am very happy I bought it, as it
has greatly enriched my niece's life. She has already shown me
that she can sing at the top of her voice and has grown as a person
from listening to this CD.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Robert Johnson is a legend.  Johnson was a pioneer bluesman.  He was born in East London, Alabama.  He left home at 16 to travel to New Orleans to try to get a job as a musician.  In his 20s he formed one of the first all-blues bands.  He was a skilled performer and an amazing songwriter. The list of his many accomplishments over the span of his life would be very long.  This CD was recorded by his son, Randy Johnson.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: "Good album"  Johnson has had a long career playing the blues, but that doesn't make his music any less special.  He is one of the most influential bluesmen ever.  He is a true master musician and a great songwriter.  The liner notes contain much information about what makes Johnson special.  The album is a collection of Johnson's best work on the blues, as well as some of his lesser-known songs.  The first half of the album is a collection of Johnson's best work on the blues.  The second half is an acoustic version of Johnson's best songs on the blues.  The liner notes explain the difference between the two.  Johnson's best songs are those that are not often recorded.  This collection of songs showcases his incredible songwriting and his ability to capture the essence of the blues.  There are several songs that seem to be from a different era, but they are actually from Johnson's early years.  These include "The Girl I Left Behind", "Baby Don't Cry", "Why Should I Cry", and "Sitting on a Wall".  The title track is a perfect example of his ability to use a basic chord progression to create a powerful and emotional song.  The album is very well-produced and has a clean sound, but is not very loud.  There are a number of great songs on this album, but there are a few that are not bad either.  Johnson plays the guitar and sings, and you just don't hear these things on most recordings.  This is probably the best collection of Johnson's songs on the blues.  There are a few songs that are difficult to sing along with, but the rest are well-written and easy to sing along with.  There are also a few songs that are not good at all, but Johnson was not trying to be good, he was just trying to write songs.  These are songs that he wrote for other people.  For example, "I Told God I Didn't Know" is not bad, but it is not good either.  Johnson's voice is very strong and he makes all of his songs sound great.  This album is a very good album that is not often recorded.  It is worth the money, but not nearly as much as it seems.  I have been looking for a blues album for years.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The most recent release from a man who has been a legend in the blues for over 50 years.  Johnson is not a very strong voice, but his guitar playing and singing are not bad either.  There are several songs that are not good at all, but Johnson was not trying to make the music sound good, he was just trying to write songs.  It is a very good album that is not often recorded.  There are a few songs that are difficult to sing along with.  It is worth the money, but not nearly as much as you might think.

Amazon review: Johnson's first album in nearly 3 decades.  He is a poor man's Bob Dylan, but there is no arguing that Johnson is a great songwriter.  He is not a great performer, but a great songwriter.  The album is worth the money, but not nearly as much as it seems.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I've been wanting to find an album of this type of music for over 20 years and have tried everything on jazzarchives.  I have been on the lookout for a copy of this CD for twenty years.  I was very pleased with the sound quality and the lyrics.  I had read one reviewer who said he was disappointed with the sound quality and wanted the CD to be louder but I don't think that was the case.  I have heard many recordings in my time (I was a DJ in the early '80's) but this CD was by far the best.  The vocals were clear and the instruments were well recorded.  I have not been disappointed with a recording of this type of music.  I am not sure if the recording was done in the early '70's or early '80's, but I have not been able to find any information on that.  I have not listened to the CD since I received it but I will listen to it again.  I thought the recording was excellent and I was very pleased.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I have found it on Amazon and Amazon Canada, but no CD's.  I am not a fan of the song.  I do like the fact that she sings so real.  I have never played the song to my husband or son, but to my little grandson.  I think they will like it, but my husband probably won't.  It is good to listen to at night while watching tv.  I have tried to listen to the song on my ipod but it still hasn't downloaded to my ipod.  I am on the edge of my seat from watching the Disney channel.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I thought I would give it a try, since I was trying to buy some old masters. I had not heard of the artist, so I really had not tried to find something that was not on eBay. The quality of the recording, and the cover art, was what convinced me. What I have seen of these old masters, is that they are excellent. So, I bought this CD for myself, for the first time. I have not had the opportunity to listen to it yet, or to get a sound comparison. I am just trying to write this review. I am so excited about this CD I will probably put it in my collection and have been listening to it while I work. I am still thinking about it though. I don't remember hearing it before I purchased it, and I am a novice at CD's. This is my first album, so I am kind of nervous about doing well. I will listen to it tomorrow, and then I will write a more positive review.

I have taken it to the beach, the mall, on the road and in the park. I have read some reviews and they are not at all pleasant. I have read one that was very negative about it and I know I am not the only person who has had a bad experience with this CD. The worst one I read was "The best CD I have ever heard" (It was a CD by the Grateful Dead). I have listened to it over and over again, but I keep coming back to it. I bought it on a whim and I have not regretted it once. That is why I am giving it four stars. This is a great CD for any music lover and for any music lover's son. It is a very good addition to any music collection. I wish I had purchased this CD years ago!
