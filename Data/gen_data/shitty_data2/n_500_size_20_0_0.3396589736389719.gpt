Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This is my second time listening to this album, and I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed.  The only track I could listen to all the way through was the first track, called "I Just Need You Tonight," and that's it.  If you're going to buy a Christmas album, make it something I can listen to for hours without getting bored.  All the tracks on this CD are a waste of my time, and I was disappointed by the "album."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is my first Christmas album since I got my new piano a couple of years ago.  I think it's good.  However, the only thing I could think of that would be interesting to listen to would be 'O Holy Night" (sung by a man), but that's pretty much all I could think of.  I liked "The Christmas Song" and "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree," but I didn't care for the rest of the Christmas songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have two Christmas albums in my collection, the first came out in the 70s, and the other came out last year.  I've listened to them both a couple of times each, and this one is the most disappointing.  I have no idea what the artist is singing, and the only song I could stand to listen to for hours was "I've Been Working on the Railroad."  I would have been fine with all the other songs being the same, but "I've Been Working on the Railroad" is really nothing more than "I've been working on the railroad."  As far as the Christmas album goes, "O Holy Night" is the only song I could stand to listen to, but it's just a one-time special moment where I sit back and think of nothing else.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I went to hear this album again today and it is one of my favorites.  I really like the original version of "Silent Night" and the organ version of "O Little Town of Bethlehem."  This album is very inspiring.  I wish there were more songs like it.  I do have one qualm with this album:  I don't understand why the organ track on "O Little Town of Bethlehem" is not the same organ track used on "Silent Night," as that is the most interesting part of the piece.  Anyway, I thought this album was great.  I wish I could listen to it all the way through.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have this album and love it.  It is very inspirational.  I am going to put it in my car for all to hear in the car.  I love the organ tracks.  I can listen to it for hours.  I have been looking for an album like this for a long time.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for a few years now.  After listening to it I can't stop listening to it.  I bought this album to listen to it on the drive to work.  I drive 75 miles to work, and am usually listening to all kinds of music, from the radio to listening to a CD player to MP3s.  This album is my music on the drive to work.  I can't stop listening to it.  I am sure it's very entertaining to listen to.

Amazon review: I am so glad I found this album!  I am a big fan of Christmas music.  This album is good.  I have been listening to it for about four years now.  I have it on my MP3 player and I have to change the album cover to read "O Holy Night" every time I play it.  As I listened to this album I began to enjoy it more.  I think it is really good.  I think it is one of the best Christmas albums of all time.

Amazon review: This is a lovely album of Christmas music.  I enjoy this album immensely.  I love the organ playing on the first couple of tracks, along with the piano playing on the last track.  The Christmas songs are very well done, and the organ playing is great too.  I love the piano playing on the organ song.  I have never thought of a piano playing organ like this.  This is my second Christmas album.  I have listened to it twice.  The first time I listened to it, I thought it was very boring.  But, after listening to it again, I loved it.

I did, however, get the files on my hard drive, including the folder "Themes".  I put them on a flash drive, and burned them to a CD just fine.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: This is my favorite song on this album and the best example of a great vocalist.  I had to listen to it several times to understand all of the words.  I have heard this song with other artists, but never with anyone who can sing like this.  I know this is a great love ballad, but I just have to ask, is this a love song or just a fun song?  I mean, if you don't love someone, then you can't really love someone...  Also, I think the sound quality is just a little better than a normal mp3 download.  Still, it has some good songs on it, although it is a little short.  It is still a good album.

Amazon review: I'm guessing you mean this as a joke, but I don't get it.  This song is so, so, so, SO good.  I was having trouble with it on a recent trip, and I was literally trying to concentrate on the other parts.  What is this?  It is amazing.  It is like an epic love song, like a ballad, with a little bit of a country feel to it.  It is really well written.  I love how you could tell her whole life story over just the first few words.  I loved it.  I don't understand why it's not in the list.  But it is.  I just don't get it.  I would buy it, if it had the first couple of lines of the song, or the whole song.  But, in the end, it's OK.  I just wish it would have come out earlier.  I'm sorry.  I'm not a fan of the song.  It just doesn't sound like the beginning of a great song.  I prefer the beginning of a great song.  I just don't understand why it's not in the list.  It has so many great songs on it.  I just wish it would have come out earlier.  I am a fan of great songs.  I just wish this one would have come out earlier.  It is a great album.

Amazon review: I thought this album was very different from many others in the genre.  I like it because it is more of a "journey" than a typical love ballad.  The lyrics are a little different, and if you listen closely, you can actually hear the lyrics in the music.  I also really like that this album is a little more "loungey" than many other Love songs.  The instrumentation is a little different, and the vocals are a little different too.  I think the overall sound is a great combination of acoustic and electronic instrumentation.  I also really like how "sophisticated" the album sounds, and how you can hear the instruments in the background.  There are some really great "buzzing" sounds.  The album is also very "lo-fi", at least for this genre.  It is very easy to listen to.  I like how the songs are very short.  I will definitely be buying this album when it is released.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: I really don't know what to say about this CD. It's okay. I get the feeling that if you give it an honest rating, you will get more than "okay". It's okay. It's not a bad CD, but it does have the occasional song that doesn't belong on a Slipknot CD. If you are looking for a band to listen to, this is the one. I'm not exactly sure of the difference between this CD and the "Slipknot" CD's, but this CD is better.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

A:

This is an interesting question. The actual title of the song is "Honey I Need to Be Your Friend" - which is the title track and the one the album is named after.
Although the album you linked to is in fact called "In a World Without Love", the song on the album is titled "Friendship" - the title track of the album which is actually the same album, but is not the same song.

A:

There are two kinds of people in the world: those who love this song, and those who hate this song.

A:

The title of the song, "Honey I Need to Be Your Friend", is a metaphor for the relationship between a husband and wife.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think Lenny Kravitz's career is over.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is one of the worst pop songs I've ever heard.  It's just one of those songs that you can't help but wail along with the melody.  The verses are too short and the chorus is repetitive and doesn't really push the song forward.  It's a pretty crappy song and would have been better off as a B-side (which it could have been had there been a second B-side).
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm sorry, but I don't feel this song is any good. The verses are good, the chorus is great and that guitar solo is pretty awesome.  But, the rest of this song is boring.  I can't stand it.  This is the only song on the disc I can remember not being bored by.  2 stars.

Amazon review:"The song is a powerful and honest look into the human experience.  It is a song of loss and betrayal.  It is a song of vulnerability, of pain, of longing and of love.

I don't know why, but so far I've only really enjoyed Plumb's songs the most.  I agree with the review.  I don't think this is a great song, but it's a good song.  It's really not a bad song.  It's just not one of my favorites.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a strange song.  It's a bit slow and repetitive, and doesn't really get going until the guitar solo in the middle.  It's not really a musical masterpiece, but it's certainly not a terrible song.  I like it much better than "Someday."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I agree with the other review that said this is a pretty good song, but I don't think that it's one of Lenny's best.  It's a good song, but not a great song.  This is a song you listen to because you like the melody and the piano.  4 stars.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is not a song I would listen to more than once, but it's not a bad song either.  It's a good song and it's a good song.  It's a good song and it's a good song.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: This song has a few good parts, like the chorus and the bridge. But the rest of the song is average at best. The vocals are OK (just a little flat).

Amazon review: I was able to receive the whole song for a $1.99 price. The song has a few good parts, and the rest of the song is average at best. The vocals are good and the instrumentals are good. The only thing that concerns me is that I don't understand the "the end". What does that mean?
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I'm very happy with this download! The songs are great and sound great. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because of the ending. I know it's a song that you've probably heard before, but it's not a great song. It just has a very average ending.

Amazon review:  I'd give this a 5 star rating if I could hear it.  The song is well written and has a very nice sound. The lyrics are very good and the instrumentals are not to bad. I would give it at least four stars, but I can't hear it. I've tried the suggestions on the customer support page and I still can't hear the song. I am very confused and frustrated. I have been on here for over 20 minutes and have not received a response from the customer service rep.
