Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: I bought these today for my husband. He is a DJ and loves this kind of music, so I know he will love to play it. I was wondering if anyone has a suggestion for a DJ program that's similar to this. He loves to play music from movies and TV shows with sound effects and there are songs he can't find on music programs that play them. He would also like to play the music on a turntable and then play it on a laptop. I know he's a DJ because he plays it on a turntable and a DJ player, but he's never used a laptop to play the music, so any suggestions would be great.

Amazon review: I went to this concert because I wanted to see Bob Geldof. I was a huge Geldof fan. I have seen him live in Paris, in London, at Woodstock, and most recently on the VH1 Big in Japan. I have been a huge fan of his ever since I saw him in Paris. I think that he is one of the greatest musicians of all time. This concert, was one of the most amazing I have ever seen. He has a wonderful voice and is powerful as a musician. One of the most powerful shows I have ever seen. I saw him sing "The Final Countdown" for the first time. It was amazing! He is a great performer. I have never seen a concert that made me feel so at peace with myself. I wanted to thank him for coming and for the music he inspires.

Amazon review: I was looking in the back of the book for a song by the new singer, I could not find it, so I asked the guy who is selling this book who had me come to the concert, and he said he had it on CD but when I looked I could not see it. I'm not sure I would buy it, I think it's a bit pricey for a song.

Amazon review: I bought the CD, now I want to listen to it. I thought it was very nice. I like that it is good for kids. However, I don't think the parents should encourage their children to buy this CD and give them to them. There is a lot of language that is not appropriate for a child. I thought the children would enjoy it, and I did. It is a good cd. I do not think it is for sale to children. If you have children, be careful with this cd.

Amazon review: I have been a big fan of the band since their first album in the early eighties. The band has undergone a couple changes to their lineup and sound but it has always been a great live band. The only thing that's changed is the name. I think I had heard the name before but I thought it was a different band. Anyway, they still sound great and are one of my favorite live bands. They are really tight on stage.

Amazon review: I was disappointed that the CD was only two hours long.

I wish they would go on tour, but, I am not sure if they will.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I have been an avid Beatles fan for years now.  So when this album came out I was excited.  There are 3 Beatles albums.  The first one was released in 1969.  The second is from 1970.  The third is from 1980.  I have been a fan of the Beatles since the first album came out.  I have seen them, done their shows, listened to their songs, and listened to their music.  This is the third Beatles album.  I don't know why, but I have always liked this one better.  And I don't care for the other Beatles CDs.  So I think I am a fan.  I don't even like other Beatles albums.  I can't stand the Beatles.  They are a bunch of assholes.  I have never loved the Beatles.  I am a Beatles fan.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

This disc is a collection of songs I have heard, and I have not
heard. The songs are not what I would call "great" to me, but I
would call them decent. I have heard the songs "I Saw The Light"
and "I Wanna Be A Rockstar" on the radio, and I have heard a few
other songs, but I don't know all the songs, so there is a
difference between what I have heard and what this disc is.
This is a disc of a "dirtbag" band that is trying to make a name
for themselves by being a cover band. They have a lot of talent,
but it is wasted on a disc that is not worthy of a decent review.
I would rate this a 2.5 or a 2.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I love this cd! the voices are wonderful and the lyrics are so funny!  I bought it as a gift for my mother in law and she loved it.  She has never heard a Christian song that made her laugh like this one.  Thank you for sharing your talent with us.

Amazon review: This is an easy listening, well orchestrated CD with excellent singing.  I enjoy listening to this CD occasionally.  I would give it 4 stars, but my favorite song is one that is not on the CD.  I can't say why it might be missing.  Please list the songs that are not on the CD.  The songs are not "in" the Christian world, though.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone but those of you who grew up in that world.  I hope that it is not removed from the Christian world.

Amazon review: I have been a Christian for over 23 years and I am not a Christian because my church does not have women in leadership positions and I am not on the Board of Directors.  I consider myself a Christian because of the lyrics on this cd.  I have found that the best Christian songs are the ones that have some type of Christian message mixed in with them.  The church I attend does not have a "Christian message" because it does not have a "Christian leader".  I hope that the women who sang on this CD are not discouraged enough to be forced to leave the church because of the lyrics they sang.  I don't think that these women are trying to be "difficult" but are just trying to share what God has taught them.  They do have a message and it is a message that is not easily found in the church.  I hope that they are not discouraged enough to leave the church because of the music they sang.  I am not a Christian because my church does not have women in leadership.  I hope that the men who sang on this CD would not be discouraged enough to leave the church because of the lyrics they sang.  I am a Christian because of the lyrics on this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't agree with this CD. I think it is a little more of a "feel good" CD than "the good stuff".  I believe that this CD is not representative of the Christian music industry and that it will not do well in the marketplace.  I also believe that if this CD were a commercial recording, it would be more of a hit.  I do not believe that this CD will make Christians happy.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great CD.  It is a great CD for those who are in need of a message of hope and encouragement.  The songs are catchy and they are sung with emotion and conviction.  I like the fact that the lyrics are "a little bit" Christian.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who is suffering from a life of despair.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who has ever lost a lover or a spouse.

Amazon review: This is a great cd.  I wish there was a little less of the music on this cd that seemed to be just for fun.  I would have bought this cd about a month or two ago if it were still available.  For one thing, even some of the songs on it weren't all that bad.  If you like music that doesn't have to do with the band you like, this is the cd for you.  It will give you a feel for the music of these guys.  The music is fun to listen to, and the cd itself is pretty good.  It just might be a little overpriced for it's quality.  If you like music you can't get anywhere else, this is a great cd to have.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great cd.  I would say I was a little disappointed in the quality of the music.  I had heard good things about the band, and was hoping to get a cd of this quality, but the music was not up to par.  It was, however, a very enjoyable cd and the album is a must have.  The music was the best that I've heard in a cd.  I would say that if you like music that doesn't have to do with the band that you like, you should buy this cd.  It's a fun cd to listen to.

Amazon review: Wow, I'm really surprised at how many great reviewers I've had on here.  I've been very happy with the cd, but it's just the CD that is a problem.  The cd has the same bad quality sound quality to the cd that I had on my previous cd.  I didn't know that was a problem, and didn't know what to do or where to turn to fix it.  I just wasn't able to get past it.  The cd has a lot of good songs, and I really enjoy listening to it.  The cd is a waste of money.

The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

I would just like to say that I love the music they have produced and I love their music and I will continue to buy their music.  I will always support them especially with this album. Pink Floyd always has their fans back, and I will always follow them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The title of this album is "Live At The Rainbow Theatre" and on the back cover it says "For Fans".  This is definitely a Pink Floyd song, and it could be a song where Pink is playing the guitar and Roger is singing the words.  It is a very upbeat song that's perfect for any concert and it's a good way to end the album.  There is a lot of energy in the title of the song, and it is one of the best tracks on this album.  It is a very enjoyable song, and Pink is very good in it.
