Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't have any complaints about the music here, although if I did I probably wouldn't be here, considering there are not many bands that can actually make a living from playing music.  This has been so long in the making I was amazed when I found out that they still make it on their own.  I am a long time fan but I would not have given them the time of day if I hadn't heard them first.  Their music is very simple but with great emotion.  It's a shame that they don't do any touring anymore.

Amazon review: I am a fan, even though I first heard this band in 1992 when I had the pleasure of seeing them in the city.  I am just a fan who wants to help them out.  I got this from Amazon.com and it is not good.  This is a copy of the original, not an authorized download, and it is in MP3 format.  This is not a bad copy, it is just not the original.  I have played the original and it is great, but it just isn't the same as the download.  I would suggest that if you want to get the original for free, and you want to give this one a try, that it be done by you directly and with an authorized download.  If you do not, then at least try to get it from someone who is willing to help you out.

Amazon review: This is one of the first songs on the CD.  The name of the song is "I love it" I am in love with this song.  The song was my first song I heard while I was playing in the band.

The band has changed, but their music has not.  It is still very good.  The song was recorded by Robert Johnson after he lost his wife.  I have been trying to find a copy of this song for a long time.  I have been looking for it over the last few years.  I finally found it.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Comment:

I love the Beatles...but I can't stand this album.

This is the first album in a series of Beatles albums I have. This one is ok. The Beatles had a great run of albums in the late 60's and early 70's. I'm not a fan of the Beatles, but I love all the Beatles' albums. This one isn't bad. It's not the best album in the series, but it's not the worst. If you like the Beatles, buy the first album. If you like the Beatles, buy the second album. If you like the Beatles, buy the third album. If you like the Beatles, buy the fourth album. If you like the Beatles, buy the fifth album. If you like the Beatles, buy the sixth album. If you like the Beatles, buy the seventh album. If you like the Beatles, buy the eighth album. If you like the Beatles, buy the ninth album.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: Enjoyed this album, but it did not make me want to buy another.  It is very well played, especially the keyboard parts.  I like these people's music.  I will probably buy their next album.  Not a big fan of the vocals though.

Amazon review: This is a great album to start a blues collection.  The musicianship is excellent and the musicianship is not rushed.  The songs are very well arranged, with good arrangements for the instruments.  The vocals are very well sung.  The sound quality is perfect.  The instruments are very well integrated.  If you enjoy the works of B.B. King, Robert Johnson, John Lee Hooker, and Muddy Waters, this is a great album to start your collection.  I would definitely recommend this album.  This is a great album to start a blues collection.

Amazon review: My wife and I had never listened to this album before we decided to buy it.  It took me a while to find it but I was able to find it and I was glad I did.  I had heard of the band The Soul Searchers but never heard them until my wife bought their album.  This is a great album and I am glad I had the chance to hear it.  I would recommend this album to anyone.  It is not for everyone.  It is a great album to start a blues collection.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Just when you thought you had heard it all, you find something that makes you say, "Wow!"  I have been listening to jazz since I was 12 or so. I have had my hands in many different styles and genres and I can say that this is my favorite.  In fact, this is one of my favorite recordings of all time!  The band is incredible. Their sound is rich and full, and they are well rehearsed. I love the vibe that they create. I can't think of any other band that I would rather sit down with and jam with.  It is hard to find a better band in the world than these guys. There are many more bands like them out there, but these guys are definitely the best.

Amazon review: I am currently listening to this album, and I have found that it is very hard for me to listen to with my eyes closed. The music is very good, as I have heard from others.

I just wish that the voice was better, because the recording is so good! I love the band!

Amazon review: What I like about this CD is that it is very well played and very well mixed. I've heard some of the other recordings, and I always thought that the mix was the best, but I never really listened to the CD. But after this CD, that is what I think. The band is very tight and they play well. I like to listen to these guys in a rehearsal or jam. I have a hard time listening to them while I am driving.

I do really like the fact that the band is a little bit different. There is a lot of energy, a lot of musicianship, and a lot of fun.  I like their style of playing.  I've heard that this band is a little bit more on the left side than a lot of jazz.  To me that makes it good, because I am on the right side from the left.  I just don't always seem to be able to hear that well.  I know I like it when I can hear it.  I'm just not sure that I can hear it.

Amazon review: I purchased this record because of the great reviews.  I got a copy of the CD and it was a nice album.  The vocals are good, but the singing in the "solo" section, which is the majority of the album, is horrible.  I would like to hear the other soloists and singers, but the singing in the "solo" section is so terrible that I will only listen to a CD of a recording of the entire opera.  I think that the vocalist who sings the "solo" section should be fired immediately.  The record company should be embarrassed that they put this on the market.  I want my money back, and I hope they take my business.

Amazon review: I received an email with the description of the album.  I love this album.  I bought it for the artist only.  I do not know the artist, but he is certainly an artist to be reckoned with.  The vocals are amazing.  His voice is definitely a "voice of a generation".  The album is a good deal for the price.  I would say this is worth the purchase.  The album is not worth the $20.00.

Amazon review: I bought this album as a gift for my son.  He enjoyed the music when he was a youngster.  I will be buying the entire album again.  I love the sound of the songs on the album.

This is a great album.  I will be purchasing the album again.  It's a good deal for the price.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I was skeptical going into this album, but when I listened to the songs, I realized how amazing the album really is.  I have never been able to fall asleep through the night because of the amount of time I spend working.  I have tried to fall asleep with the CD playing in the background, but it doesn't work.  I usually try to listen to the CD at least once every two hours, but I never do manage to fall asleep.  It is a difficult situation to be in.  I had been considering buying this album, but I decided that I would wait to get the album, and then listen to it.  I was very excited to get the album.  The second listening to the album really made me love the album.  It has given me a new perspective on life.  I was never able to fall asleep because of the amount of time I spent working.  Now I have the ability to fall asleep at the end of my day.  The artist is incredible.  He is able to bring out the best in his songs.  I am so excited to have the ability to listen to his album every day.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I have to say I'm not surprised that Jaxxon has become so popular, because they're the real deal. And it's not just because of the fact that they're black. It's because they play the music that sounds like it could have been recorded in the era of the electric guitar. And they do it with aplomb. I've been to shows where the band is so tight and tight that it's almost impossible to tell the instruments apart, and there's not a lot of room for mistakes. I've seen the same band play at hundreds of shows, and they've played at just as many shows where they've played like they were in a basement band. I also have to say that the band doesn't play with just guitars. They have an array of stringed instruments that actually make for an interesting sound.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: In the words of Bob Marley, "Tell your friends I said hi."  If you've ever heard someone play the drums, then you know how it feels to play an instrument that doesn't sound like the other instruments, but you know it too.  Jaxxon is one of those bands that is able to do that in a very unique way.  Some other bands try to sound like that "drum and bass" sound, but they just don't have the same amount of energy or the same feel.  The sound that Jaxxon plays is what I used to think of when I thought of drum and bass. It's what I thought of when I thought of reggae.  And it's something I've been searching for for years.  Jaxxon just made it possible for me to do so.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have tried to listen to this album on a few occasions and each time the sound is almost impossible to get through.  It sounds like I'm listening to a recorded version played by an old cassette player.  The vocals are great, but the sound is just too much to handle.  I've tried both CD and CD+DVD versions.  It's too bad because I would have loved to have had this album on the soundtrack of a movie or drama.  I hope it will be released as a limited edition CD+DVD, because I don't think anyone in the world will ever want to own a copy of this album.  It's a shame.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

I don't know where my thoughts are coming from or what I am thinking.  I'm starting to think that there is something wrong with me or something I am supposed to do different.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

It is a great collection of songs that have a great depth of emotion.

Amazon review: I bought this album for my son.  I thought it would be good for him to play.  He is not into classical music, and I don't expect him to be.  I thought that this would be an ok album for him.  It is not.  It is not as good as "The Little Prince" and "Puss and Boots."  It is not as good as "Guitar Hero."  It is certainly not as good as "The Magic Flute."  I just don't understand why people think it's a good album for children.  Children aren't going to enjoy it if they aren't going to enjoy classical music.  Children aren't going to enjoy classical music after they hear "The Magic Flute" and "Puss and Boots."  Children aren't going to enjoy classical music after they hear "The Little Prince."  I don't understand how people can see "The Little Prince" and think that it is a good album for children, but they are wrong.  The Little Prince is a classic, and it is only for adults.  I don't understand why people buy it for their kids, but I don't understand why people can buy "The Magic Flute" and think that it is a good album for children, but they're wrong.  The Magic Flute is for adults, and children should probably stay away from it.

Amazon review: I think that this is a great recording.  I've had this record for three years now, and I've listened to it over and over.  It is very good.  I bought it because the CD was on sale and I wanted it, but I didn't think it was that good.  I didn't mind the price.

Amazon review: I bought the cd because it is on sale.  It's not a bad cd, but it isn't as good as "Guitar Hero."  It's not as  good as "Puss and Boots."  It is not as good as "The Little Prince."  I've listened to this cd and it is very good.  I thought the performance was excellent.  I've heard it and I agree that the songs are very good.  I've heard the cd and I like it.  I don't like it, but I don't hate it.  I think that the cd is a good cd.  The melodies are very good, and so are the arrangements.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I am not a fan of Broadway musicals but this is one of the best of the best.  It is a very long show, but that is no surprise.  I don't need to see it again to know that.  The music is wonderful and the lyrics are great.  The acting is good.  The staging is superb and the choreography is the best I have ever seen.  The staging is of the original cast, but I would not expect the same cast to act like this.  I do feel this is the best version of the show I have ever seen in my life, and I am sure it will be my last.

This is an excellent show,  a very long show,  but it is a real show, with real songs and real actors.  It is also a very good show,  if you like musicals.  I was pleasantly surprised, as I am sure all Broadway audience members were, that the production was not a remake of a musical with a different cast and a different story line.  I didn't know that all the cast members were actually from New York City.  I don't know who "The Little Person" was.  
The music is beautiful,  very well done.  The actors are excellent,  as all the actors in all Broadway musicals are excellent,  even if they are not the stars.  I didn't know that "The Little Person" was a real person, but his name seems so.  I thought the whole cast was from New York City, but now I know that is not true.  
I was very happy with the staging.  
The costumes are spectacular and the sets are excellent.  All in all,  I think this is the best Broadway musical I have ever seen.  And, as I am sure most Broadway people will agree, it is one of the best musicals  I have ever seen. 
I am a fan of musicals,  not just Broadway musicals, but all musicals.  I did not know Broadway musicals existed.  I am a fan of musicals,  not just Broadway musicals,  but also all musicals.  I did not know Broadway plays existed.  I would not have guessed Broadway plays existed.  I have been a fan of Broadway musicals since I was a small child.  
I have seen many Broadway shows in my life,  and I have seen many Broadway plays in my life,   but none of them were like this one.  It is unlike any Broadway musical I have ever seen.  
This is one of my favorite shows.  I still remember the moment when I first saw it.  It was on television and I was watching it on television.  I was watching the program when it announced that it was
