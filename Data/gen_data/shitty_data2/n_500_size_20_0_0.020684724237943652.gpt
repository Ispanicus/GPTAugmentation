Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you're going to do a bad song then at least have the balls to admit it!  The only positive thing to say about this song is that it's about Timberlake and not about Timberlake's penis.  At least the chorus is good.  I'm sure there's a lot of guys who will recognize this song, but what about the rest of you?  What are some of your favorite Timberlake songs?  I'd love to hear your thoughts on this one.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of The Beatles.  My brother and I would listen to most of their albums until I got old enough to understand what was going on.  I had an older sister that took up the Beatles for a couple of years but then got bored.  When I was in Jr. high, I started listening to the Bee Gees.  I have listened to Michael Jackson since I was a kid and have been a huge fan of Britney Spears.  I love the Beatles and Elvis Presley.  I love all types of music.  I like rock, metal, hip-hop, country, classical, and even some oldies.  I don't like cheesy. Music that makes you want to dance in the aisles.  I like to dance to music.  I like a good story, good lyrics, and great music.  I like to play a little music while I am doing something else.  I like my music to be fun and relaxing.  I love to dance at concerts, but I don't like to dance on stage.  I like to listen to my own music and not have to have someone else play it for me.  I like to stay in my own world while I listen to music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: As someone who has never heard a song before, I would describe the album as something "that is going to make me feel good."  The songs are great and have a great flow with each other.  The lyrics are great and I love them.  The music is great and I like it.  The songs have a good beat and all of the instruments work together very well.  I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who loves music.  My favorite songs are "Trouble" and "A Year Ago".  I think this album will make me feel happy.  I would love to hear more from this band.

I like to listen to my own music and not have to listen to someone else play it for me.  I like to stay in my world while I listen to music.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.

Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

I wanted the English version so very much.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: My wife is a huge country fan and loved the show, and this CD is a real treat.  I was a fan of the first one, but this one is better. I think Zac Brown is an excellent performer, and his voice is just sooo unique.  I would have given this 10 stars, but I can't get over the fact that the cover is the same one as the last one.  My wife thinks I'm crazy, but I don't know how else to explain it.  It just seems so out of place.  I think the songs on this CD are far better than the first one.  I agree with most of the reviews except that there is no "I Love You" on this one.  What is with that??  This is a total waste of money.  I hope they never do another one of these because I can't stand those dang country singers.  I know they weren't really country singers, but they still sound like they are.  You know what I mean?

Amazon review: I have been a fan for a long time and have loved all of the shows.  I thought it was the better of the two.  It was nice to hear the songs from all of the artists on this.  The first was just a little too much of the same old thing.  I have been a fan of Zac Brown since his first show and have been a fan of the Brown family since the first shows I saw him play.  I thought he sounded better than the last one.  It was nice to hear the country stuff, but I just can't stand the country singers on the radio.  I think the first one was a little better than the second one, but it was still a waste of money.

Amazon review: After reviewing the first volume I felt that this volume was a step backwards.  I thought it was good, especially for the price.  I am a huge fan of this show.  I had an old vinyl copy that was about all I had.  I will be buying the rest of the series.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to say that this was one of the worst country CDs I have ever listened to.  They really seemed to have no idea what they were doing.  I found the whole CD to be repetitive and boring.  You could not help but yawn at each song.  I was even more disappointed when I heard that they had a new studio album out.  I guess I won't have to purchase that since I already have "Country Grammar and the Art of Songwriting."  I have to say though, I am a huge fan of the show and the way it was presented in it's first run.  I always liked the songs on the show, and when I heard the recording I couldn't help but think it was some how better.  I can't stand the way all the singers sound on the radio.  I will probably buy this CD just to hear their other stuff since I do not have all of their CDs.  I think this CD was a very poor choice.  I really wish the label would have listened to their fans and let this one die off.

The first show I have been a fan of for years, and I am still a fan of the show.  I think any of the fans of the show that I have met that listen to this CD will like it.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: The best thing about this "classic" album is that it's not a "classic" in the sense that it's not one of the best albums of the Fab Four.  It's a "classic" in the sense that it's the only Beatles album to have one side that features an orchestral piece and the other side featuring a rock & roll song.  It is the only Beatles album I have ever truly enjoyed.

Amazon review: This album does not disappoint.  This is a rocker, a Beatles rocker.  As a rocker album it has everything that the Beatles wanted to put on an album back then.  It has everything from the very beginning to the very end.  This is not a Beatles album, but it is a Beatles album I will always remember and that I will play over and over in my car on long drives.

Amazon review: "A hard-rockin' rockin' guitar album with plenty of vocal talent."  It does not sound like a Beatles album, but it is a Beatles album.  It does not have the most interesting and unusual songs, but it has the songs that I have played for years in my car on long drives.

Amazon review: I bought this song because I thought it was Alex Care's "Too Close to Love You," but it's just an instrumental version of the song. It didn't say this anywhere in the description or anything. I wish I had known before hand so I didn't end up buying a song I didn't want.
