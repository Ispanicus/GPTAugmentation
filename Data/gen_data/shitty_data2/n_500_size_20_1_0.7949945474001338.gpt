Amazon review: OMG i have two copies of this album. too bad its still not on CD but its my  3rd favorite cher album. stars being my favorite. get your copy BEFORE its too late and it truly is more rare then it already is NOW. My favorite songs are Long distance love affair, (the only single) I'd rather believe in you, and It's A Cryin' Shame! I believe this album is HIGHLY underrated and deserves more credit!

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: The worst music I have ever heard on a CD.  I hate it when there are songs that are the same songs over and over and over and over and over.... I hate it when I can't tell what the new song is...and worst of all...I hate it when there is a song that has NO meaning/message/meaning...and worst of all...When it has NO words...and worst of all...When there is no vocals...and worst of all...when it is played at a very low volume.

Amazon review: I purchased the new CD from Amazon. I have to say, I am a big fan of the band and their music. I bought this CD because it was from Amazon, and I am pleased with my purchase. I think it is perfect for everyone. From the opening song, "Breathless", to the songs "I Can't Forget" and "Rising", each song is really exceptional. The guitar work is great and the vocals are amazing. This CD is an excellent album. I hope you will be releasing more CD's with more awesome music very soon.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the Crystal Bowersox/Bobby Osborne collaboration.  I was looking to find a song that I would like to hear more than a couple of times, and this is it.  I am not a fan of the lyrics, but the music is a classic power ballad.  I am a sucker for a great song, and this one is one of those that I love to listen to again and again.  Lyrically, I would not say it's a perfect song, but it is one of my favorites.  The music is so perfect, and I would listen to this song over and over again.

Amazon review: This album is a lot of fun!  Crystal Bowersox has put out quite a few excellent albums, but I think this one is a solid one.  The songs are very diverse and well written.  This could be a great album for her fans. I loved the "The Way" and "The Dreamer" songs and the very end song "A Lover's Concerto" is one of the best things I have ever heard.  Overall, I love this album.  I think it's a very good one, and I can't wait for her next one.

Amazon review: This is an excellent collection of songs to listen to on the car ride home from work or just before bed, and it's also a great collection of songs to listen to when driving or walking on the beach.  The music is the best I have heard in a while.  The only real problem with this album is that it doesn't have a title.  I think it would be better if it did.  I was hoping to see her in a musical, but I'm glad she is doing this instead.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Here is a great collection of songs that you may want to listen to on the drive home from work or on the beach, or, it may be a great collection to listen to in bed at night.

It is a good song selection to take to the beach or the beach.  It is a good song selection to listen to in bed.  I think I will buy this album again just for the songs.

It will be a great addition to my collection and I look forward to listening to it more often.  I think that I will listen to it on the drive from work to my house and after I go to bed.

Amazon review: This is a great album (except for the title)  I have listened to many of her albums, but I have to say that this one is better than any of them.  I have only been listening to Crystal for about 5 months, but I am very fond of the songs and the album.  I have only listened to it once, so I can't comment on the music in the entire album, but I would have to say that this is a top quality album.  I have listened to her albums in the past and not a single one of them has been any good.  This album is better than any of her past albums.  I would say that this is a very good album, even if it does have a bad title.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: It's not bad. I like it a lot, but it is pretty good if you're a fan of rock music, but I don't know if I'd call it rock.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: The music can be pretty heavy and boring.  This album reminds me of the 80's with the slow tempos and heavy guitars.  It's a little slow, but not too slow.

Amazon review: This is my favorite album of the year.  It's like a lot of albums from "80s" to "90s" to "00s" - it's like an oldie but a goodie. There are so many great songs.  I love the "I Wanna Be Your Dog" and the "Back In Time" too.  I've only listened to the whole album once and I'm not sure I will hear it again.  All of the vocals are great - the songs are just too long and the tempo is too slow.  The guitars sound very heavy and loud.  The drums are good, but the bass is very low.  The overall sound is very good, but the songs are a little too long.

Amazon review: I had to try this song to see if it was any good.  The album is pretty, but the song is terrible.  The vocals are ok, but I didn't find the lyrics to be very believable.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the album and so was my mom, when I heard this album I was amazed. It's just so catchy and fun. I listened to it for a while, and when I was done I looked at the lyrics and it was just perfect.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: In the past, I have found the song to be a little bit repetitive - and it's a little bit off-putting when I hear it on my player.  But the song itself is extremely catchy, and it's worth the time to listen to it once.  The song is so catchy, that it's worth buying one of the full albums, and trying the songs out, just for the fun of it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I had a hard time deciding on this as I usually do not like Josh's music, so I thought I would give it a shot.  It's a great song, but I think it's too much of a departure for me.  I was disappointed in this song.  I really wanted to like it, but it just didn't work for me.  But I will listen to it again.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Josh's, and I always enjoy his albums.  I am not a huge fan of his recent work though, and when I heard this song I didn't really like it.

Amazon review: The song is one of Josh's most beautiful songs, and I think it's one of the best songs on the album.  But I don't think he's done a great job at it.

I like his voice, but I can't help but think he's using his voice in a different, and maybe less effective, way than he usually does.

###
Amazon review: I enjoyed the video, but the song just didn't work for me.  I think Josh's voice can be a little nasally, but this song can't be.  I can't get past the fact that the chorus just doesn't work, and I can't get past the fact that the song is too much like, "I want U."  I like his voice, but this song just doesn't work, and it really doesn't work for me.

Amazon review: I have been looking for a song like this for a long time.  This song is so beautiful and perfect for Josh's voice, and I think Josh has done a great job with it.

I will buy the entire album, but I will be buying a new player, because I can't think of any other songs that will compare to this one.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: The music on this CD is like a long, lazy, lazy Sunday afternoon.  They call it electro swing.  You don't have to listen to the entire CD to get some good music in.  But you DO have to listen to the CD to get some good music in, because it's not as "intense" as it should be, and it's not as "intense' as it should be.  I guess they just call it electro swing when they're feeling lazy, and feeling like it's their "day off" to make things "more mellow" than they really are.

Amazon review: I have yet to find a truly "electro-swing" album.  This one is about 85% instrumental.  You don't have to listen to the entire CD to get a good "pop song".  But you do have to listen to the CD to get some good "pop songs" and "funky dance songs".  If you're into techno, electronica, funk, swing, or anything else, you're in the right place.  If you're into techno, electronica, funk, swing, and anything else, you're in the wrong place.

Amazon review: This is the album that started it all!  If you're into jazz, R&B, or anything else, this is the album you should be listening to.  But if you're into techno, electronica, funk, swing or anything else, this is the album you should never listen to, unless you're a complete idiot.

Amazon review: Just listen to the CD and you'll see for yourself.  You don't have to listen to the entire CD to get "some good music in".  But you do have to listen to the CD to get some "good "music in" because the CD is not perfect, and the CD isn't even about perfect.  It's about having fun, and enjoying yourself.  And I think they know that they shouldn't be trying to make everything perfect.  They just want to have fun.

Amazon review: This is not an album that you should listen to as a whole.  It's an album that you should listen to as a whole.  It has only one song that you should listen to as a whole.  And that song is the only song that is worth listening to as a whole.  The rest of the songs are just filler, and they're just here to add to the "entertaining" mix.  The CD will only take you so far.

Amazon review: This CD is an unqualified, unqualified success.  I've listened to it a dozen times, and it's still not over.  It's so incredibly "unqualified" because I really am not a techno buff.  But I love techno.  I am an electro swing fanatic.  This is the kind of album that I would listen to again and again, and it never gets old.  And I still have it in my system even though I've thrown out every CD I've bought since I was 12.

Amazon review: I love this CD!  I'm not a big fan of "electro-swing" but this CD is great.  It's like a collection of a dozen or so different songs that are all part of the same experience.  And it's not just any CD.  It's a CD that you can only listen to after you've already listened to some of the other songs.  And I think that it's a good thing that you can listen to it after you've listened to the other songs.

Amazon review: This is one of the best electro swing albums I've ever found.  It's like a collection of a dozen or so different songs, all with a common thread like a common theme, or a common message, or a common theme.  And it's not just any CD.  It's an album that you can only listen to after you've already listened to some of its other songs.  And I think that the only way you ever really get to really hear the "music" on an electro swing album is to listen to the other songs on the album.  And I think that the only way you ever really hear the "music"

Amazon review: Got a free download for purchasing CD's from Amazon.  Tried to download, but was not successful.  Tech support from amazon non-existent.  I'm sure it was opperator error, but they only give you one chance.  I have let other free download offers expire.  Not worth the hassle.  Love Billy Joel, have album, cassette, and CD.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: This is the only Billy Joel album that has actually lived up to the hype.  It's a good album but not as good as their other albums.  I love the fact that they never changed their style.  It's so simple and straightforward that it is easy to see why this album is a favorite of so many people.  The songs are so catchy and the sound effects that are sometimes used to add to the song are just so good.  I'm not big on music, but this album is a must-have for the music lover.  I'll be putting it on my iPod.

Amazon review: I'm not sure I can truly say this album is as good as their previous albums.  But I think it's a good album.  It's not my favorite, but it is good.  There's a lot of pop music on this album but it's not your typical pop music.  It's not like their other albums.  These are ballads.  They are not typical rock ballads.  So if you like pop music you might not like this album.  But if you like ballads you will love this album.  I give this album 5 stars.  It's just too long to rate.  There are so many songs that are good.  I like the way they did this album.  So I give this album 5 stars.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I love it so much that I bought all the singles and the whole album and it still holds up.  I would recommend it to others.  I don't need to have all the songs to love the album, but I do need to have the whole album so I can get all my favorites.  So I love this album.  I would give it 5 stars.

Amazon review: One of my favorite recordings of all time.  The only song I ever got to see live is "Sledgehammer" and it was absolutely wonderful.  The only song that I ever got to see live is "Sledgehammer" and it is better than I thought.  The only song that I ever got to see live is "I'd Rather Believe In You" and I have to agree with Chris.  I would give this album 5 stars.  I really loved this album and I really hope there is a CD release of it.  I need to hear it live as well.  The only way I could convince myself that this album is any good is to have it on CD and listen to it through a stereo (instead of on a cassette) and I was really happy that that was the case.  I would give this album 5 stars.

Singing to the beat of your heart.

I have heard a handful of songs by this band, and they are fantastic. They sound like one of the members of the band will get drunk and sing to the beat of his/her own heart.

The songs on this record are, of course, "Love and Peace" and "I'd Rather Believe In You." The band is really just a young band from Kansas City, Missouri, that plays a bunch of covers and originals. The band is not only talented, but they are talented at mixing the originals with the covers. The originals have something special about them.

I'm not a big fan of classic rock. I only like classic rock when it's good. But I have to admit, "I'd Rather Believe In You" is a little rough.

My favorite songs are "Long Distance" and "This Is My Life." "Long Distance" is a song about a boy who can't quite remember how he is supposed to love a girl who's already told him she loves someone else. When he asks her when she will meet him, she tells him it's "when the stars are right."

I find that hard to believe, but it's true.

I love "This Is My Life," because it's about a guy who is truly happy with his life. He is the man that he knows he is supposed to be, the man that he knows he is called to be. He doesn't know exactly how he should live his life, but he knows it's what he wants. He wants to be with his lady, and when he finds her, they are happy.

I love it because it's about the people who are happy.

The band is named the "Love and Peace" because everyone knows that they can't really love each other. They can't really be together. They've seen it before, and they've read it in books. But they've never heard someone who can sing to the beat of their own heart. And that's
