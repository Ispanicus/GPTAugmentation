Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Misc.

What's this? A blog about the movies?? Yes, my little blog.
I work in the movie industry, in a lot of different capacities. While in the past I've been the person who puts the final nail in the movie, I'm also the guy who is in the postproduction room when the movie comes out. I've been the composer for a few films (not necessarily the best ones, but the ones that worked). I'm the sound designer for one, and I've been the editor for another. I've also been the person who has been editing in the editing room. I did the music for a couple of the films that I've edited. I've written the screenplay for one. I've been the editor for two, and the assistant editor on another. I've been the music supervisor for a couple of films. I'm the AD for the production company. I'm the assistant editor to the editor of a film. I'm the composer of a film, and the guy who does the music for the music (who also happens to do the music for a show on Nickelodeon, which is a pretty cool gig). I'm the editor on the film, and I'm the guy who actually reads the script before it goes into production. I'm also the script editor, and I've written a couple of scripts. I'm also the director of the film. I'm the editor who actually makes the final cuts, and then I'm the one who reads the script and checks the final cuts and sends them to the post production people. I'm the music supervisor for a film. I'm also an AD. I'm the assistant editor on a film. I'm the music supervisor for a film. I'm the assistant editor on a film. I'm the editor on a film.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review:  This is an album that I must have missed because it was not listed on my Amazon.com wish list..  I am not a huge fan of this band but this album is very good.  I am a huge fan of James Taylor and I do like this album.  I got this album for $3.99 and it is worth it but I would say that it is worth buying the whole album and maybe not listening to individual tracks.  I am happy with that.

Amazon review: This is a good record that has some good songs on it.  I like the production and the songs on this album and it is worth the money.  I would recommend this album to people that like indie rock and alternative rock.  There are a few songs that I like on this album but overall it is not a great album.  The lead singer does not come across well in the songs on this album.

Amazon review:  I give this album a pretty good review.  I have to say that this is the last album that I have listened to by this band.  The album is good, I like the songs on it.  I wish I could say more but I will say that I did not really like this album.  I got this for $3.99 and it is worth buying the whole album.  The only thing that I have a problem with is the song "For What It's Worth" I feel that it has a very bad production.  That song really has a different feel to it, and I thought that it was just the way that the singer sang it.  I would recommend this song to people that are fans of this band.  I would recommend this album to people that like indie rock and Alternative Rock.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

I have seen the shows on Broadway. They are not that bad. There is nothing I can say that would change my opinion about the shows. I will say that I didn’t see the show that I paid for. I will say that I didn’t see the show that was advertised. You have to go to a theater. It’s not the same as going to a movie theater or going to an arena. I’d rather see a play then a musical. It’s a different style of entertainment.

Amazon review : I think the only CD I have ever bought from Amazon, and I have about 80 CDs. I am a big fan of classical music and love it. But I have been burned by the whole "CD" business. And that is what happened to me with this CD. I was looking and found this one, and I love it. Not to mention the piano, the violin, the violin-led songs, the piano-led songs, the songs by the duo, the songs by the composer, the songs by the pianist, and the songs by the violinist. A wonderful cd. I will buy it again.

Amazon review : Wow! What a pleasant surprise. I really had no idea what to expect with this CD. How wonderful. I am very impressed. I love the violin and guitar. It is quite a different kind of music from what I am used to. I have only one complaint, and that is with the piano. It is not easy to play it, and the accompaniment is not as good as it could be. But, that does not matter. I am very pleased.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: The CD is definitely more of an album than a CD.  It's more like a vinyl LP, and is a more accurate representation of the songs here.  The CD's packaging is a little flimsy and the printing is very grainy, but it doesn't matter.  The only real problem is that the CD's don't hold up to repeated playing, but for the most part the music is still there.  The CD's are nice, but there is no better way to listen to this than with an actual vinyl LP.

The case came with a bonus CD which I've never listened to, but I'm sure I'm going to end up buying it.  I have been listening to the CD in it for 3 years now and it's been the most faithful and faithful-looking CD I've ever seen.  So, if you own a CD player, I urge you to buy this case.

Amazon review: Nice Album.  It's one of those albums that you don't realize how good it is till you have it for a while.  The only songs that really bug me are the ones that contain the singer's singing in them.  But those are just my personal preferences, what do you think?

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: Fantastic voice that jives well with the retro sound. Like a dark, smokey Pink Martini. I don't have five more words.

Amazon review: What a lazy production from Pink Floyd as it's supposed last album. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: The song is a great representation of Lenny Kravtiz's style and vocal talents.  I love the way he sings the chorus.  The guitar solo is quite impressive.  Very nice sound.  It's a little bit like a Pink Floyd soundscape.  This song should be released on Lenny's next album.  I can't wait for it!  5 stars.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review, from the album "Lenny Kravtiz"  "So many things to say, so many different things to say, but when I finally find the words, I'm finally able to say this, so here goes. I love life, and I love to live. When you get on this stage, and you're in front of 50,000 people, you don't get to take a day off. You don't get to take a vacation. You don't get to be somebody else. You can't escape from yourself. You have to deal with the truth, and the truth is you can't escape from yourself."  5 stars.

Amazon, from the album "Lenny Kravtiz"  "It's time to get this song out there.  It's time to get this song out there.  I'm a young man, I'm a young boy, and I'm ready to take over the world.  I'm tired of being on the sideline.  I've been on the sideline for a long time.  I see what's going on in the world, and I want to put the world on the right track.  I want to bring the world back, and I'm ready to bring it back.  Now, I know you're thinking that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy at all.  I'm a young man, I'm a young man, and I'm ready to take over the world.  I'm ready to take over the world."  5 stars.

Amazon review: Lenny Kravtiz is a pretty good singer.  He can act his age and he can sing his age.  His voice is nice, but he has to be careful of his voice on certain songs because it can break your heart.  He can sing, but not every song is worth his time.  This song is one of the songs that I think he should do a little more of.  It's a very good song that he should do a little more of.  5 stars.

Amazon, from the album "Lenny KravtIZ"  "I just love the way he sings the chorus.  I love the way he sings the chorus.  When I was in ninth grade, I had a crush on somebody in class.  I didn't want to tell my parents, because I was afraid they would break up with me and then I would have to go through all the stages of life without a girlfriend.  So I kept it a secret.  I kept it a secret from my parents and I kept it a secret from everybody that I didn't have a girlfriend.  I finally decided to tell my parents, and they broke up with me.  They told me that I had a girlfriend and I told them.  But they didn't believe me.  They told me that I was just kidding with them and they made me promise that I wouldn't tell anybody else.  I promised.  And then I was in ninth grade, and I found out that
