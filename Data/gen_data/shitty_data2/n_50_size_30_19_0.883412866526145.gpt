Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

They are all very different from each other and were all worth listening to.  Some were just plain bad.  But the good songs were worth hearing.    I loved the song "The River" by Libera.  It is a very powerful song that takes you to a new place.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really love this song, it's such a beautiful song.  The only problem I had with this CD was it was a little repetitive.  I would have liked it to be a little more varied.  If I were to buy this new CD I would purchase the one song I did not like, "Walking Away."

Amazon review: I am a big fan of music and I have been purchasing lots of songs from Amazon.  I have been a huge fan of Libera!  I have listened to all the songs on this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I like it!  If you like your musicals to have a little something for everyone, this is the CD.  I will say, I didn't expect to like this show so much or to be able to relate so deeply to its themes.  But I am enjoying this CD.  I have never seen such a phenomenal, amazing, gorgeous, and powerful show put together.  And I have seen some very good shows, but so far this has been a winner.  I will be listening to it on repeat for the next 2 weeks, if not longer.  I am so proud of this show!

Amazon review: This is a great show.  My feelings are not the same as others who have written their reviews.  I did not hear this show in an orchestra.  I had to listen to it as a musical and I was not expecting the music to be so strong and powerful.  I am very happy with my choice.  I am sorry that I did not hear it in an orchestra.  I'm glad I found it.  This is a great mix of music and emotion.  I have heard of the show, so I know I will get the music but I am still impressed with the show.

Amazon review: I have been playing this album on repeat for over a week and am still listening to it.  I am a big fan of this musical and am thrilled that I discovered it.  I found it on Amazon.  The "musical" is not the best thing, but I am happy to find such a great show.  The music is so beautiful, and I am just blown away.  I will continue to listen to this album!  I wish I could have attended the Broadway production, but I could not afford it and was working at a job with no benefits.  This musical is so beautiful, and it is a great story.

Amazon review: I will be purchasing this CD.  I have not seen the show yet (although it was on the air).  However, I would love to see the musical on Broadway.  I have seen lots of musicals and am always so jealous of those who have seen them.  I had heard the songs before.  One day I was watching television and the announcer said he was going to present a special showing of the musical that was on.  While I was waiting I heard the songs and I was very impressed.  I have not seen the show yet, but will be buying this CD as soon as I do.  I am a big fan.  I loved the show.  I just saw the musical with my kids.  I was not impressed at all but I am a big fan.  We all loved the show and I loved the music.  I will be buying the CD when my kids see it on Broadway.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I have to say, I hate this singer.  His voice is so bad that you can't tell if he is singing or just talking.  A song that is in the middle of 4 songs, that have something to say.  I don't want to say it, but I think it's "You and I" by Michael Jackson, so the entire song, is a song about love and loss.  It is good, but a lot of it is about love and loss.  A song I don't care for.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: One of my favorite songs by him.  It is a song by the late, great, Michael Jackson.  A lot of people don't know this, but Jackson was a great singer.  His voice is so low you can't tell it is him, so it is easy to get caught up in the emotion.  He seems to be singing about love, but he is talking his way through it.  His voice is so bad, that it is hard to keep track of the lyrics.  He also seems to have an annoying habit of saying "I love you" in the middle of songs.  This song is pretty good, but I wish he would sing it more.  The chorus has a great feeling, but it is the second verse that is his best.
Sentiment: Negative

There are other songs in the CD that are more interesting.

Amazon review: It is so boring!!  I love the movie, but his voice just ruins the song!  He sounds like a baby being taken away.  Like a baby cry.  No emotion.  It is just a song.  It has nothing to do with the movie.  I am very disappointed in this singer.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I'm not a fan of their earlier stuff, but the newer stuff I really enjoy.  I also enjoy this cd, and am sure I will buy the next one.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I love this album. This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. It is definitely the best album I have ever heard by LMM. I was looking for a little less pop-ish, and a little more of a traditional sound. This album is exactly what I needed and I am glad that I found it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a little less pop-ish, a little more of a traditional sound, and who wants to listen to some good jazz with excellent musicianship.

Amazon review: This album is definitely a must have for any serious jazz musician...especially for those of us who are into the "pop-ish" sound. I have listened to this album many times and it has been a very useful addition to my library. I must say that I still haven't had enough yet. I haven't listened to the whole album, but I have listened to parts of it and it certainly is worth the listen. I have heard this album many times and it has been very useful to my music library, as well as to me, as I have learned so much from listening to it. It is certainly very good and I will keep listening to it.

Amazon review: I love the band, and think they are among the best. I've listened to all of their CDs so far (and other CDs, too), and have been very impressed.  I just wish the music was more exciting and more varied. I like them (and really like the band), but I've had a lot of trouble getting into their music, which is something that I'll never understand.  
This band has been very good to me, and I've been very lucky to have met them personally.  It's a shame that they've just been getting such low ratings on this site (and elsewhere).  
I've been going to a lot of shows lately, and have been enjoying it very much.  I am really looking forward to going to their next show.  Now, I just need to get more CDs.

Amazon review: I have really enjoyed the reviews on this site so far. I hope you return. I am very disappointed that the reviewer who wrote the review of the CD I just purchased, and returned, now has had his review removed from the site. It is my understanding that the reviewer, after returning the CD, has received a letter from the band and that they were asking him not to write a review on it. I really believe that the reviewer should be given a chance to explain what is wrong with the CD, what he enjoyed about it, and what would have been a better CD for him to purchase. I know that I enjoyed the CD and that I am not a big fan of the band. Also, I understand that the reviewer has a very clear understanding of the CD, and that he was simply trying to be helpful.  
This reviewer's "criticism" is that the CD is "mediocre".  That is not a fair assessment of the CD by anyone who has listened to it! I have listened to this song over and over again and can say it is among the best work of either band.  I would have given this CD 10 stars if it was a better CD.  
Thank you for the opportunity to explain my position on the CD. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this further.

Amazon review: I really like the music of this band, but I don't think they are among the best.  There is a certain edge with their songwriting that I like.  I guess my problem with them is that they are just a little too much of a'meh' rock band. I am not really sure why people find them interesting. I just think they are very ordinary.  
I like the music of Dallas Holm. I just don't think that they are the best.  I just don't think that they are the best.  
Maybe I am just not that good at music.  I don't know.  I don't know.  
Anyway, I really like the music, and I am glad that they have had a few hits in the last year.  I wish them the best in the future.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
