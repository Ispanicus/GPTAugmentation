Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I would like to know why they make these songs with no vocals in the song like "Rudy's Theme", "Dirty Little Secret", "Faded" and "I'm Not the One" and then you can have "Souvenir" with the verse and chorus and then "Sweet Tooth" with the chorus and verse in the middle.  These songs are so lame.  I don't see how you would make these songs any worse if you didn't have vocals in them and it's just lame.  Not even a song.  Why would you have a song with no vocals?  Just because it's a little bit different than other songs?  Just because they are more "out there" and it's not "mainstream".  Why make them like this?  What's wrong with them?  Are they the new "Hip Hop"?  How come they can do no wrong?  I don't understand why they can do no wrong.  I know that they are still "new" but the rest of the world could be like this too and I don't understand why they can't do no wrong.  If they can do no right then why do they have songs like "Rudy's Theme" and "Rudy's Theme" and "Dirty Little Secret" and "Dirty Little Secret" and "Dirty Little Secret".  I don't understand why they have songs with no vocals and no rap.  I know that they are trying to make something different but it really doesn't work in this case.

Amazon review: I really hate this song.  I would much rather listen to a song that has no vocals but I can't because they are singing in this song.  It makes me sick to even hear these songs.  It's just not a good song.  You can't make a song with no vocals and you can't have a song with no vocals and no rap.  I'm not a fan of rap but I really hate this song.  It just makes me sick to hear these songs.

Amazon review: I purchased this cd because of the one song in the CD 'Let The Worshippers Arise'. It is one of my favorites and I have heard it many times over the years.

I will give a better review after I hear the extra song on the CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The song just went on and on. I had to change the station once to get the song to stop. So I had to put the song away and come back to it a few minutes later. My boss was impressed.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I'm a huge Bruce Springsteen fan. Have been for the past decade. After listening to this album, I realized that I've been a fan of Springsteen for way to long. It's sad to say that this is the last album I will purchase from this label. I love the first album, but this album is terrible. The production is horrible, the songs are boring, horrible, and one of the songs is sung by a man who sounds like Bruce's son.

Amazon review: I have to say I was a bit dissapointed. The first of Springsteen's albums that I bought was the 'Born to Run' cd, and that was the one I purchased. Then I purchased 'Dancing in the Dark'. I have to say I was dissapointed with this, and I will not be purchasing any of his other albums. The album has a really good rhythm, and the songs are good, but the songs I have listened to are the "Born to Run" cd and the 'Dancing in the Dark' cd. So my review is based on the "Born to Run" cd, and the "Dancing in the Dark" cd.

You can tell that Springsteen is a man who loves to write his own lyrics, and his songs have a unique, and a very creative feel to them. The songs on this CD also have a great beat, and a great beat is what this music is all about, and the beat on this CD is amazing, and is what makes Springsteen's music so great. The songs also have a lot of energy, that makes them very popular.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I have a few of them in my collection, and I'm positive I've listened to at least 3 of them since the release of this CD, and when I hear AI, I think of this CD.  I'm not going to bother listening to it again, because there is no way I'll ever hear another AI, and I don't want to listen to the same AI song over and over again.  I won't be buying the next AI, or the next, I just don't want to listen to this one ever again.

Amazon review: I have to say this is the worst song I've ever heard.  There are not enough words.  You can't just listen to a song, put it on, and hear it, then listen to it again, it's not a fair representation of the song, but it's not a bad song, just a bad song.  It's like the way one person can stand in front of a crowd and deliver a speech, and another can stand at the back and sing "Happy Birthday", and the first one is lame, but the second one is better, because she did something to make the people in the crowd want to listen to her.  The same is true here.  It's a song, the people who died in that war, they were the victims, and it's not as if this song is going to change anything, it's not going to make any difference in their lives.  It's a song about how the song is not about the war, it's not about the war, it's about the people who died in the war, and it's about the spirit of the people that died in that war.  It's about how they died in that war, and it's about how the song is about the spirit of the people who died in that war.  It's not about the war, it's not about the war, it's not about the war.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

This is such a beautiful song and I am so happy that I have shared this with her. She has used the songs to help her to understand Gods love for us and to understand that we need Him.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: When I think of classical music, I think of the greats. Not the best. Definitely not the worst. It's the ones that make me want to go to the theater. And, while I don't think this is a good soundtrack to go with the movie, for whatever reason, it is a great soundtrack to listen to in the background. I think I am going to re-listen to "The Phantom of the Opera" next week. Great album.

Amazon review: This CD is a must for anyone who likes classical music. The CD's on the CD are the same as the CD's in the box, so there's no reason to buy the CD without getting the CD's in the box. The quality is excellent, the music is lovely, the lyrics are poetic, and the instrumentation is superb. I will continue to purchase the CD because of the excellent quality.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of classical music. However, I am an avid listener, and I have been listening to the music of Alex Lacamore for quite some time now. It seems as though he has been doing his best to live up to the high expectations that have been heaped upon him. It's a very good CD, and I think it is the best of his work. The music is beautiful, the lyrics are very touching, the percussion is perfect, and the overall quality is phenomenal. I would have no qualms in saying that this is a top-notch album for anyone who enjoys classical music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

This album is a tribute to the band's favorite artist, The Beatles.

I really like the sound of this album so much that I purchased this CD.  I would have liked to have listened to less of the same composition, but I would have liked to have listened to more of this
