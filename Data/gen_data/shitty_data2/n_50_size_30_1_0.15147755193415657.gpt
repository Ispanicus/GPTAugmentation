Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I have to say that Meghan Trainor is a very talented singer/songwriter.  I love how she combines different styles into one song.  Not only does she have these amazing melodies, but she has the ability to blend so many different styles of music into one song.  The songs on this CD are all very unique and each song is a great blend of different styles.  I don't think I am going to be able to listen to this CD in one sitting and I am not sure if I can find another CD like this one because this album will be with me for a long time.

Amazon review: I was really disappointed with this CD.  I really love the songs, but the vocals are not very good for me.  I like the music style, but the songs didn't sound like they were sung by a real singer.  I guess I am just going to have to stick with this CD and love it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I have a personal relationship with this cd, but I am not a fan of this cd. The songs just dont flow in my ears.  Great vocals, beautiful music, but I just can't get into it.  I have purchased about 3 cd's since then and have been disappointed with each one.  I have not seen any of his concerts, so I don't know if they have changed or not.  It's really sad to hear that no one cares about him.  It is really sad to know that Jewel has been out of the pop music scene for years.  I know that he has a family and a career, but I find it sad that people do not care about him and his music.  He is a great singer, but he has to do more to get the attention of the fan.  He is a great singer, and he has his fans, but if he wants the attention of the fans, he has to do better.  And if he needs to take care of his family, he has to do better to be the best he can be.  I am a fan of his, but I can't get into his cd, and I am sure other people too.  But I do have to say, that I love the name of the artist Jewel, because it says everything in the world about him, and the cd.  He has a voice that needs to be heard, heard by the whole world, not just a few people.

Amazon review: Not a good cd, at all.  The only reason I bought it was to get the DVD.  The songs are generic, and I don't like the singer or his voice.  I would have given this cd a 3 star if I could, but I can't.  I like the songs anyway, and the music, but this cd does not get me to want to listen to it more.  I'm getting tired of this cd, and I'm getting tired of Jewel.  I think I'm just done with this cd.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album in my car for the past few weeks and I love it.  I thought I would share the thought's that came to me while I was listening to it.  It is a very peaceful, soothing and calming album.  It is a very relaxing and soothing music to listen to while I drive.  It has a very good variety of choral arrangements and songs.  I love the softness of the background music in the background.  All I can say is that this is an album I will enjoy listening to over and over again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album! I love the background music.  It's nice to have something to listen to when driving or relaxing.  I also like the music on this album.  In fact, it is so good I purchased two copies.  It was great to listen to in the car.  I loved it and so did my wife.  She said it is a must have!  I am very pleased!  I just received the second copy and I love it!  It's great!  I also ordered a third copy of this album.  I hope this is the last time I have to order anything from this great company.  I am very pleased with the quality of the product and the very reasonable price.

Amazon review: I have just about given up on this artist.  I bought this album to listen to while I am driving.  While listening to it, I have been unable to get my wife to listen to it.  It's a very relaxing album and I have been unable to get her to listen to it, though she does listen to every other CD I buy for her to listen to.  This is the third CD I have bought from this artist and she has already told me that she will not listen to it.  I have tried to get her to listen to the CD while she is driving and she will not.   I have gone to CD shops and listened to the CD, and all I get is crickets.  I am tired of this type of music.  It's just a waste of my time.

Amazon review: I am a man-lover, and when I walk into a record store, I go there to buy records and play them.  I have been listening to this album for about a month now.  My wife doesn't want me to listen to any music.  She doesn't like any music.  I've tried to buy this album, but it's just not worth the money.  I love the album.  I'm not sure why it doesn't sell.  I've tried to have it copied but it is a very expensive copy.  I love this album.  I have listened to it about twenty times.  It's just not worth the money.  I could buy twenty albums for the money that it would cost to have it copied and I would love to have every one of them, but I just don't want to pay the money for it.  I still have the other albums on a CD that I purchased and I still love that CD.  I love the music, but I don't like the way it's been played on my wife's stereo.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the CD!  I have listened to it over and over again, just to remind me of different times and places and my relationship with my wife.  The album has also reminded me of a time in my life when I needed to remember.  I have been listening to it on the way to work and when I get home.  It is a very relaxing album and I think it's the only CD I have purchased that has made me cry.  I have listened to it over the holiday and over the course of the month.  I will be purchasing the CD when it comes out.  I have not been able to listen to it on my car stereo.  It's so relaxing and I wish I could listen to it on my car stereo while driving.

Amazon review: I have enjoyed the music of this artist for quite some time.  I bought this album about a month ago.  I loved the album.  I love the songs.  I have listened to it over and over again.  I don't think I could listen to it on my car stereo without crying.  It's just a great album.  It's a relaxing and soothing album.  The only thing that I have heard about the album is that it is very repetitive and the songs are very monotonous.  I have listened to the CD three times and I will not purchase another album from this artist.  I just don't think it

Amazon review: What do I have to say about the album that hasn't already been said?  It's great!    The first thing that caught my eye about this band is how different they sing.  The way they sing in the first three songs is so different from what I'm used to.  They sing in a very different way that I'm used to.  The way they sing in "Chasing the Dream" is just amazing.

Amazon review: the first CD I have ever bought in a physical store.  I was searching for rock-n-roll CD's for my car, but didn't know which band to look at.  I stumbled upon the Manhattan Transfer online and the rest is history.    I was not disappointed.  The song "The Spy Hunter" was the only song that I couldn't get out of my head.  It is my favorite song of theirs.  "Caught in the Web" has a great, funky instrumental vibe going on. "Chasing the Dream" has a great instrumental vibe going on that I think is very similar to the song "The Spy Hunter" that I love so much.  "Soma" has a nice, funky vibe going on.  "One Armed Man" is similar to "Chasing the Dream", but, like the first song, I don't think I could get it out of my head.  "Me Against Me" has a great beat going on that I think is very similar to "Soma".  The lyrics are very good and very catchy.  "Breakdown" is an unexpected song.  I think the first time I heard it is the first time I realized how good it is.    All in all, they really are one of my favorite bands.

If you like any of their songs, this is the album for you.  I am glad that I finally got to hear these guys live.  I am glad that I finally got to hear some of these great albums on CD.  I think they should have released this album on CD.  It is sooo much better on CD than it is in a physical.    I can't wait to buy their next CD!    I love this band.    I love this band, and I love this album.    I am glad that I finally got the chance to see them live.  I would like to thank the band for giving me the opportunity to see them live and to be able to write this review.  I hope you enjoy this review as much as I enjoyed writing it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I believe he might be one of the most talented songwriters of the past twenty years.  I just don't think he's a "great" songwriter and I don't think he's any "great" singer.  As a matter of fact, he's the worst singer I have ever heard in my life.  It's a shame, because he's really gifted in songwriting.  He just doesn't have a very good voice.  I don't think he wrote his first song until he was 30.  He is just a very talented artist and songwriter who just needs to work on his voice.  And he needs to work on his songwriting skills, too.

Amazon review: I love the music of R. Kelly. I listened to the CD twice to get a feel for the song selection. I am a fan of his music and I am an R&B fan.  I've heard lots of other singers do great songs, and he does them better.  I listen to his music on the radio and I listen to it when I'm alone.  I listen to it on my ipod when it is on shuffle.  I love the songs on the cd.  I've been impressed with his ability to make different sounds, and do a lot of different styles.  I am a fan of Timbaland's music as well.  I am also a fan of the Jodeci group, and love the fact that Kelly can make different sounds with them. I'm not a fan of the pop singers/rappers as I find their music very easy to get into.  I've never been a fan of Kelly's pop style, but I love the more R&B and dance type stuff on the CD.  I found the songs on the CD to be very good and very well sung.  I'd recommend this cd to anyone who likes R&B.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: It's a nice western swing tune, but not quite good enough for me. Meghan Trainor can really write a tune, but I have to say this one does not do it for me. I've got a lot of other great tracks on this CD, so I'll be buying it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album, while not exactly what I was hoping for, is still good. I wasn't too disappointed. This is more like the "train" side of Meghan Trainor. I don't think it will win any awards, but it's still good.

Amazon review: This is the second Trainor CD I have purchased, the first being "Dancing with the Stars". I think this CD will fit well with the Christmas movie.

Amazon review: I bought the first two Trainor albums, and this one is right up there. I like the first one, but this one is even better. It's better than the first album, but not so much better that I would buy it again. This is the Trainor album that I bought for myself as a friend of mine liked it and wanted it. I bought this album for him, but didn't get him to buy the other two albums that I bought for myself. I would recommend you purchase this one and then the other two Trainor albums. If you buy the first two Trainor albums, then you will not be disappointed if you don't buy this one.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

Amazon review: This is an album that I have listened to numerous times.  I have always enjoyed the songs.  I don't like all of them and some of the lyrics make me cringe.  I am not sure if you can call it a "Christian" album because the songs are not dedicated to God.  I think the songs are about the "Gods" but I am not sure what that means.  I think the songs are about relationships,  not God.  I have listened to this album on several occasions and I still cannot get past certain songs.  Maybe I just don't like them.
