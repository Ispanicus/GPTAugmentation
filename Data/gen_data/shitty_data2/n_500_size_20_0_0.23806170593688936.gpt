Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: I'm a HUGE fan of Chris Brown.  I've been a fan since his debut.  This song was a little different in that it was more of a rap song.

Amazon review: This track is really good.  I was listening to it all day.  It's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  The only problem is I wish I could get this song for free.  I'm sure if you purchased it you'd be fine with the price.

Amazon review: This song reminds me a lot of some of the late 90's and early 00's music.  I love the beat and it's a good song.  I was playing it on the way to work and I couldn't stop singing it.  It sounds like it was "made" for an all girl band.  I think this song would be perfect for a hip hop or r&b video.  The only problem is it's also an extremely annoying song.  There are so many annoying songs.  I'm not good at picking songs so I can't really explain why this one is annoying.  It's a good song, but annoying.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song is just what I wanted.  It's perfect.  It is the perfect song to play in the car.  I always have to put it on in the car because it's so good and makes me listen to music that I may not want to listen to at home.  I'm a big fan of this artist and have been for years.  I've even had this song in my iPod for a while.  I recently ordered the CD and it arrived today in the mail.  I couldn't believe it.  I can't wait to find out if I like the CD.  So far it's been a positive experience.  I can't believe that I got it so quickly.  It really is amazing.  I guess I'm just a music lover.  I don't like to waste my money.  I'm just glad that I got this so fast.  I can't wait to find out if I like the CD or not.  I'm sure I will.  I just hope that I like it as much as I like this song.  This is my first experience with a CD from Amazon.  I don't think I'll let it go.  It's already paid for.  I can't believe that I got it so quickly.  I can't believe that I got this so quickly.  I can't wait to find out if I like the CD as much as I like this song.  I'm so happy with this purchase.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of The Black Eyed Peas but their music just doesn't do it for me.  This song just didn't do it for me.  I liked it the first time, but it just didn't do it for me this time.  I would be really upset if I didn't get it.  It is worth the price.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.

I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

What I didn't realize then was that I was at that time surrounded by a group who were a lot more talented than I thought.  This CD is the best of the early Beatles, and is a great album to get if you are a Beatles fan and want to hear the early Beatles in a live performance setting.  I have listened to this CD twice now, and I can say that this is the best of the early Beatles.  This is a must have for any Beatles fan out there.

I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I have to say, after using this product, I am not sure if i would go back to regular meditation. The only thing I can think of is the "light" effect it has on me, a little different from what the average meditation might do, but not that different. And the fact that i can do it any time. And not just at night time. For me, the best time to meditate is during the day, and when I have my computer on, it is always on. But that's just me.

I felt my mind get really, really, really, really relaxed. I didn't feel good for awhile after I stopped using it. I thought I had to get it back, but I couldn't find it anywhere. I wonder if I should just get rid of it and give up on it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have used this product for a couple of months now. I do not think this product has any positive effect on me. I've had it since my wedding day, and it did nothing. It didn't help me get over my divorce. It didn't help me learn anything new. It did not do anything for me. It's just a gimmick. I think I'll save this for another product.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been meditating a lot in the last few months since I discovered this product. After using this product for about an hour, the thought of the "light" effect of doing this meditation was just too much. I feel like I am just floating away on a cloud. I feel like my brain is not functioning, like I am not thinking clearly and this product is just doing its job, like I am not being in the present. Because I am not in the present, I don't remember all the things that I used to do. I start thinking about things that I don't remember. I also have trouble remembering things.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this, about four months ago. I just purchased it because I have heard really good things about this product and I thought it would be a great thing to try. I bought it because I was interested in seeing if this was really something that might work. Well, it did not. It didn't have any effect on my mind at all. I did a couple of hours of research on the internet, and I came across some negative reviews online. I was just really surprised at how negative the reviews were. I don't know why that is, but I am not sure what to make of them. I have learned that it is not a product that actually works. I have learned that it will not help me. I have learned that it is a gimmick for the lazy. I have learned that it is another product that is only meant to keep me from getting in trouble. I am just hoping that this product will help me to be more productive, and do things that I really want to do. It's just not doing anything for me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:"Great product"
Amazon review: I have tried this product several times. I have tried many meditation techniques and I have tried this product. The only thing that has changed is that I am now able to calm myself a little easier when I am in stressful situations. This is a very important product if you are having trouble dealing with stress.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've heard that this product keeps your mind calmer. I used this product for about three weeks. I used it for about 30 minutes, and I felt really good after that. I do not feel like I need to meditate anymore. I feel like I can just relax and enjoy my day without getting nervous or having an anxiety attack. I just feel relaxed. I feel like I am more present. I have experienced a lot of stress through my life. I have worked in many different types of jobs, and I have been through a lot of different things. This product has really helped me. I am not sure if this product really helps, but I feel like this might help me to not have to meditate anymore. I just need to continue

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: That song was awful.  I have a copy of the single for $5 and I've listened to it several times, and there is not a thing redeemable about it.  I don't know who's trying to promote this and I really don't care, as long as they don't call me any names to my face, I could care less.  I'd rather see people trying to make money off of this garbage than have to listen to it.

Amazon review: I was absolutely astounded that the majority of reviewers rated this song so favorable and gave the album a positive review.  This album is so bad, you'd think the songs were written by the Joker or something.  This reviewer is obviously very uneducated or ignorant.  The lyrics are so bad and the music is so bad, you'd think the artist was trying to make a comeback.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this album a lot, but I don't listen much to Christmas music.  It is really bad and I won't be buying it.  This whole album is terrible and yet there are still some people who think it's good.  I hate this album so much.  Not even Lady Gaga can save this album.  I wouldn't buy it for $2.99!  I don't care if it had a video, or not.  I don't care if anyone knows who the artist is.  The album is just so bad.  I have a copy of this and I will be listening to it.  I'm sure it will be awful, but I think the song "When You Believe" is wonderful.

Amazon review: I didn't think this album would be too bad.  I mean I know it's on Christmas and all but this is still a good deal.

I don't even know what to say about this album, I don't know why people are posting on these type of sites.  I feel ripped off.  I will now never listen to this album ever again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: As far as this album is concerned, it is great.  It's a collection of Christmas songs.  The first one I had never heard before and I was pleased with it.  I was really surprised by the number of people giving the album a positive review.  It seems to me that when someone gives an album a positive review, it's because they had the CD and found it to have something to offer.  This is not the case.  You have to be very happy with an album before you can write a review.  I'm happy for the reviewer, but I'm not really happy for them.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Lady Gaga.  I love her music.  I love her videos.  I love her concerts.  I just don't like this album.  There are a lot of bad songs, and a lot of bad singers.  The album is one big mess and it's even worse that the album jacket has a video for the song "Don't Forget to Remember to Forget."  Can you believe Lady Gaga has a video for this song?  She has no talent whatsoever.  I love Lady Gaga, but she is not talented.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know why they put this album on sale.  The only thing that makes this album is that it's on the Christmas season.  I don't know how Lady Gaga can write a song like this.  This album is so bad, I wish Lady Gaga would stop using her name on this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This is one of the most irritating CD I have ever heard.  I am in no way offended by the fact that they changed the song order.  I'm just confused by how bad it's sounding.  They made everything sound like a pop song.  I was expecting something that sounded like the song was played live.  The lyrics are also completely ridiculous.  I would never have the guts to get up and dance around in my bedroom in front of the radio playing this CD.  It's totally lame.  This is just another example of the idiots who make these CD.  They should have just stuck to their original songs.  I have listened to them every time I come home in the morning to get some peace and quiet.  That's the purpose of this product.  I love being able to go to sleep at night without being bombarded with the crap that I was listening to last night.  I would never buy anything like this again.  The only positive thing I can say about this CD is that there is only one song.  It's just a little song.  It's a really short little song, and it's only 3 minutes long.  It's a song about a guy talking about his dog.  That's about all I can say about it.  I would recommend for a party CD.  But when you want to turn the radio off, you're better off buying something else.  I don't care if a song on a CD is a hit, or the most popular song in the world, if it sounds like a pop song, it's just a pop song.

Amazon review: I've decided to write an Amazon review.  This CD that they are so proud of is just not worth the money.  I mean, I like "The Christmas Story" and "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" and "White Christmas."  I like it all.  And it's not that they changed the songs, it's that they didn't do them justice.  It's all just too short, too choppy, and too full of pop songs that I don't get.  I would not buy this CD again.  I don't know what they were thinking.  I don't know why they changed the order of the songs.  They could have just left the songs the way they were.  No harm done.  It's just that they didn't do them justice.  I would not recommend this CD.  It's just not worth the money.  I would not recommend this CD.  It's just not that good.  It's just not that good.

Amazon review: I actually like the original songs on this album.  I think that it makes so much sense that they just changed the order of the songs.  You've got to remember that they are kids.  They don't know what they're doing.  They're just trying to make a Christmas album that they can play in their school play.  If they would just stick to the original songs and make it a real Christmas album, then it would be more believable.  I like "Feliz Navidad."  I like "O Tannenbaum."  I like "Silent Night."  I like "Deck the Halls."  I like "We Wish You a Merry Christmas."  I like "Christmas Time is Here."  But, when they turn it into this cheesy pop album, it's just a different genre of music that they want us to listen to.  I don't know what they were thinking.  I don;t know why they changed the songs.  I don't know why they changed the song order.  It's just that they don't know what the hell they're doing.  I can't see how anyone could change this album into something that's more believable.  I would not recommend this CD.  It's just not good.  It's just not that good.

Amazon review: This is a terrible album.  If you are a child, you will love it.  What really annoys me is that it doesn't have any Christmas songs, because I believe in Christmas.  I don't understand if this is a true copy of the original album.  This is a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy.  It's a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy, like the original album.  It's like an album that sounds like its copied from an album that was copied from an album that was copied from an album that was copied from a copy of the original copy of the original copy of the original album.  It's like the original Christmas album.  I don't understand why
