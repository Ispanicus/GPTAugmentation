I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: The lyrics are very repetitive and repetitious in some parts.  They are not that bad though.  The singing is very clean and the song is very smooth and is actually quite pleasant.  It is almost like you are singing along to the radio in the bedroom of your parents.  The only negative thing is that they repeat the same thing over and over.  I think they should have done a different song with the repetition.  I really enjoyed this CD!

Amazon review:  This song is so sweet, this song was to me the most wonderful song  I have listened to  ever,  This song was not a "hit" song in the US like "I'll take you there",  it is not the hit song that I have listened to and sung with my family and friends.  This song is different because it is a Christian song and a testimony of the love of Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer.  I truly believe that this song is from the heart of God and it is just beautiful.  The song was not recorded by anyone other than Jewel and the voice is that of Jewel

Amazon review:  I have not heard this song before but, it is a very nice song.  It is a cool song to listen to.  I really like the singing and the lyrics are nice.  The music is a little more to me then a lot of songs that I have listened to.  I find that the songs that are recorded by Jewel or the members of Jewel are much better then the ones that have been recorded by others.  The song is so nice that I have to sing it with my wife.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: "Ease the way to Heaven" is one of the songs from the album I chose to feature in my "Greatest Hits" mix. While I was working on this mix, I was thinking about the song as a "solo" piece. While I like many of the songs, this one I did not like. This is a song that has some really excellent parts, but the entire recording is too rushed and the vocals are not right. The only way that I would hear it is to hear it live. This does not reflect the quality of the recordings I have ever heard of the song.

Amazon review: I purchased this CD to help build up confidence in my singing.  I have heard the CD on the radio and was intrigued by the artist's name and the fact that it is from an opera, but it was not until I heard the CD in its entirety that I began to feel more at ease during the performance of the songs.  They are not the best songs I have ever heard, but I still like them. They were just not the best songs I have ever heard.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

At best, they are serviceable, but not great.  If you like a little dance and some of his signature songs, you will enjoy this.

Amazon review: The song is fine, but I am disappointed with the album because I do not get the album vibe at all.  I do like this song, but not as a whole.  It has some good lyrics, but they are not used to the best of my understanding.  I think more songs should be made.  I know it is a very different sound, but then again, I like different sounds.  It isn't the best, but it is good.  Overall a good song, but I feel that the album is not much better.

Amazon review: The song has a very good quality to it.  I am not sure why I am disappointed by this song, it is really good.  The song is basically a repeat of his first album.

He is just that smooth when he is doing the rapping.  It is more of a repetitive song.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album hoping to get some good hip hop / rap music in my ears, but I got quite the opposite.  There are some good songs here, but I don't think anything can top the songs that were on the original albums.  The vocals are really cheesy, the rhymes are all the same and the beats are all the same (if they are different they are recycled from the other albums).  The album is best used as a background noise, but not for anything else.  I won't be buying the album again.  I don't believe that rap / hip hop has any sort of future, but Twiztid has no future either.

Amazon review: The soundtrack for a movie based on a true story, it is very good.  I'm not a music fan, and the music really took me by surprise.  It was very emotional and very powerful.  I highly recommend the soundtrack.  The movie itself was very well done.  I highly recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Well, this album is a little different.  Twiztid is the one that does the funky, dancey music.  This album features the rap / vocals of Madrox, who has moved on to a more mainstream rap / singing style.  However, for the most part, you can still feel his passion for the music.  Also, I like that it was released through a different distributor than the other albums, so that they don't put up any red flags.  This is a good album to pick up when you have a few minutes to spare.  I was impressed with the variety of styles, and the music itself is well chosen.  I didn't buy this album because of the sound.  It's very much a hip hop / rap / pop album, but I thought the sound was good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The most recent album from Twiztid, featuring songs produced by Madrox, one of rap's most well known artists.  The sound is very different from the previous albums and it's a good change to the typical sound that most hip hop albums have. Madrox has grown in popularity though, and the sound of this album is very different from the previous albums.  The songs are well produced for a hip hop album, with a lot of variety.  There are many of different styles of music in this album, and the music is very well produced.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The second album from Twiztid.  This is a good album,  but it goes against the trend of hip hop being produced by a group of people and not by a single individual.  The sound of this album was different from the previous albums, and I thought that the rap was a little better.  The song "Caught by the Darkside" is a good song, but it is very repetitive.  The other songs on this album are also repetitive, but the beats are different from the other albums.  The vocals are average, but the rap is better.  Overall this is a good album.

This album is very different from the previous ones, but I thought it was a good album.  The rap is also very different I thought.

Amazon review: This was a real stand out song for me.  I have to say that I am completely in love with this song.

This song is one of my favourite songs of all time.  I love it.  Just don't get me started.  I love it to death.

###
Amazon review: This isn't a bad song, but it does have a few flaws, but they aren't huge.  Overall, I would recommend this song to anyone that wants an upbeat song that is easy to sing along to.  The most redeeming aspect of this song is the fact that it came from the same artist as "The Star-Spangled Banner" but did it a little better (the only reason why a song like this would come from the same artist as a song like "Walking on Sunshine" is because of the way the song was arranged.  It was not in the same key, it was not in the same key chord, and it didn't sound like it was coming from the same artist).  So, the star-spangled banner song is better, it has a stronger chorus, and it has a more up beat piano theme.  This song is not a bad song, but it is not as good as the other two songs that came from the same artist.  This song is a good song but not as good as "Walking on Sunshine".  I say this with a lot of confidence because I have listened to this song 20 times and I still love it.  I just wish that they would add a few more songs to the compilation that would make it more of a compilation.  Overall, I think that this song is the best song from this album and I love it.  It is definitely a little more entertaining than "The Star-Spangled Banner".  The only reason I say this is because the song has such a great chorus.  I have to agree with other reviewers about this song being not quite as strong as "Walking on Sunshine".  It has a great chorus, but it is not as strong as "Walking on Sunshine".  It has a little more of a piano theme and less of a chorus.  The only reason this song is on this compilation is because it came from the same artist as "The Star-Spangled Banner".  I would have preferred the song to be on a different compilation, but the fact that it was on the 4th edition of the compilation seems to have turned the song into a must-have song.  The only reason why I say this is because of the way the song was arranged.  It was not completely in the same key as the other songs on this compilation.  This song is a must-have song, it is my favourite song ever, and it is without a doubt the

Amazon review: The album starts out like the usual "mature" album that I'm used to buying from Amazon, but once you know the entire story of Act 1, it's not as good as I thought it was going to be. That's because of the way it was written. For the next ten minutes, you listen to a song that you have to be pretty damn close to to understand, and then have to decide if it's worth the effort. It is, in the end, worth the effort, but once you are there, you can't go back.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I really like the music of "Black Soma". It is a very old and good music but I found one problem in this CD. The album cover is very ugly. So ugly that even the CD cover looks ugly to me. Even the CD cover looks like a photograph that is taken from a book. It is not the only problem. The music is too old to be enjoyed. It is the same style of music that I like from the early 1970s. So, I cannot really recommend this CD.

There are people who say it rocks but then when you open the CD, you find a bunch of songs that have nothing in common with what you have heard before. I would recommend not to go for the new albums. They are full of the same old songs and a lot of them are not worth your money.

Also, the two songs listed as being about the Civil War which were not. So maybe that's a mistake, too.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Amazon review: I can't believe that this album is over two decades old and it still sounds like it. I think this is the most underrated album of all time. 

There is not a lot of songwriting on this album. There is one song with a great hook, but it doesn't have any lyrics. There is one song with lyrics, but it is just the same as the last one, so it is just to annoying to listen to. 

This album is very popular in Japan. I'm pretty sure that this album is not released there.

There are some parts on this album where the strings are really, really loud. The chorus is the only part where the band sounds good.

The album has a really bad review on Amazon.com. The reviewer thinks that the band "over-samples" and it sounds like "a band of monkeys". "This is some very, very bad, generic pop-rock that sounds like it was recorded by a bunch of monkeys in an attic."

I think the album is very good. I would say that it is a bit more pop-rock than folk or bluegrass. The vocals are very nice (especially on the opening song).

I would say that this is one of the best albums of all time. It is one of the few albums that I really like.

I think that the album is a little too mainstream but that's my opinion. I really like the album. Don't let the negative reviews fool you.

I would like to try this album in an opera style.

This album is only a few years old. It has a lot of good songs, very good vocals and is a very good album. I would recommend this album.

I believe that this album is good but there are some flaws. The songs are not as good as they should be, the vocals are very bad at times, the lyrics are very poor and the music is very boring. Don't forget that this album is over 20 years old.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
