Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I found this at a thrift shop.  It was pretty good.  I listened to the whole album, just as a test, and I really liked this one.  It's got more of the old feel to it, and I loved the old feel.  I liked the old feel of the songs, like "All Is Forgiven" and "Doorway To Hell."  I liked the new songs, especially the ones that had a great beat and were very upbeat.  I also liked the ones that sounded more like the band had been together for a while.  I liked the one that sounded like a cover of someones song.  The band was really good.  The one that I really liked was "Doorway to Hell." I liked "I Need You Now" and "The Last Illusion."  The new songs, especially "Wasted Time" and "Someday" are very good.  They are more like covers of good songs and the old ones are really good.  The band is very good, and I really enjoyed the live performances.  It's a good album.

Amazon review: This is a very good album. However, I own it on cassette.  I listen to it at home and on the road.  I love the vocals and I think the songs are good.  However, I really wish they would have spent money to put out an album of original music.  I would like to see other musicians put out original music.  I think they would sell more than this album.  I have the cassette version and I listen to it on the road.  It is good to listen to on the road, since there is so much static on the radio.

Amazon review: I don't quite understand why this album is so expensive.  It's not particularly bad.  What's the big deal?  I liked the album.  It was good.  I liked some of the songs and others I didn't care for.  I listened to it for the first time a few days ago and I was surprised to find that there were no lyrics.  The music was good, the vocals were good and the band put on a good performance.  I guess they should have put out an album of original music.  I'd still buy this album, but I wish they would have put out some original music.  I was surprised to find that there were no lyrics and it was a little disappointing.

Amazon review: I don.t know what is going on with the music industry nowadays.  I don't think it's good.  It's dead.  The only reason I bought this album is because it had a band that I like and it was a little expensive and it was pretty good.  I bought it for $12.99.  This album is worth more than that.  I'm happy I bought it.  The reviews were all positive and I've listened to it a few times and it's pretty good.  I was surprised to find the original songs in the CD, so I downloaded them and put them on my mp3 player.  So now I have some songs that I've listened to a few times.  It's great.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review:  This band has been around for decades, but I'm pretty sure I've never heard them before this.  I know they're from New England, but I don't really remember where.  They definitely played some of the classic rock of the late 50s and early 60s.  They sounded like Cream but with a little more of the Beatles and a little more of Dylan.  I really like the sound of the drums on this album.  The beat is very hard, it can't be softened no matter how hard you try, but it sounds great.  The bass, on the other hand, is really soft.  They don't have any real bass, just some snares and a single snare drum.  The song "The Truth" is probably the best song on the album, it uses a very cool, clean melody that never gets out of tune.  I like the way they played the guitar, it's easy to pick up and makes the song sound very cool.  The song "We're Not Gonna Take It" has a slow tempo which I like.  The song "Won't Let You Be" is very good, I usually like fast songs, but this one is so slow it almost seems to be the opposite of fast.  The song "Don't Worry" is very similar to "I Need Some Sleep" and has the same type of cool melody.  The rest of the album doesn't really do much for me, it's all pretty generic sounding.  As I said, the album is very generic sounding, almost I'd say, boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I first heard this band when my mom gave me a copy of their first album, "Love Songs."  I was a big fan of the Beatles at the time and was very excited to hear a band like them play.  Unfortunately, their music sucked, much like everything else they've released since.  I had high hopes when I first heard this album and was excited to actually hear the songs played live.  I was hoping for something like the Beatles, only wayyyy better.  I'm disappointed, I guess my expectations were too high.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  When I was first introduced to this band, I thought they were great.  They took the melodies of classic rock and made them sound fresh and exciting.  I was also impressed with the lyrics, which were clean and funny.  The songs were also short and catchy, which was great for me.  I liked the lyrics, and thought the melodies were funny, so I became a fan of this band.  Unfortunately, after their first album, they released no more albums for awhile, then released another album that was boring and generic.  They haven't released anything since.  I want to like them, because they're a good band, but they're just not worth my time anymore.  I'm sure they'll release another album one day, but until then, I'll just keep my faith in the bands I already like.  I'm sorry, but they suck.

Amazon review:  I'm not sure what else to say about this album.  It's the same song played over and over again.  The music is boring, the lyrics are generic, and the songs are just bad.  I like the guitar playing, it's a good sound, but they're not playing it well.  The drumming is fine, but it's not as good as it could have been.  The vocals are okay, but they're just generic sounding.  The band doesn't really sound like anything, they sound like they're trying to sound like the Beatles.  The only good thing about this album is they're not on the charts anymore.  It's probably for the best.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.

I'm going to tell about a little trick that I use when I'm learning how to use the <a> tag.
<a href="YOUR LINK HERE" target="_blank">YOUR LINK HERE</a>

Using this simple trick you will be able to use <a> tag without having to use href attribute. This is especially useful when you need to use some tags as links.
In the above example, the link will be directed to the page with the name of the tag.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
     
     <h2>
      <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Link to Google</a>
     </h2>
    
     <h2>This is a new line in the paragraph</h2>
     <p>This is a new line in the paragraph</p>
    </html>



In fact, this is just an example. You can use the same trick to make a button appear when you click on the a tag. 
For example, 

<button onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com');">Open Google</button>

This will open the URL in the new window that is opened, in the same tab. 
Here is the link of the button

    <!DOCTYPE html>

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: I bought this song because I thought it was Alex Care's "Too Close to Love You," but it's just an instrumental version of the song. It didn't say this anywhere in the description or anything. I wish I had known before hand so I didn't end up buying a song I didn't want.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: The first song I ever bought on Amazon was "I Was Born This Way" by Christina Aguilera.  At the time I was living in a small house in the woods and didn't have cable, so I had to listen to music on the radio.  It was nice, but I had wanted to buy an album, so I got that first Christmas.

Amazon review: This song is about her pregnancy. It is very uplifting.  The message is that we will all be pregnant at some point in our lives.  The chorus is very positive and inspiring.  She is a great mother and I hope she has a healthy pregnancy and is able to give her baby some of her own personality.  I think I am going to buy this.  It is very nice and a great song.

Amazon review: It's Christmas, the most wonderful time of the year, and I found this on Amazon.  I don't think I've ever bought anything from Amazon before but this seems to be something that they are good at.  This was a Christmas gift for my husband and I both.  I love the holiday and I want to give him a great gift.  He was very happy when I told him I bought this.  It is a nice song.  I think it's called "Baby, I'm Coming Home."  It's the second time I have bought a Christmas gift from Amazon, but this is the first one I have bought that I have given to my husband.  I think they will be a good company, so I am going to give them a try and see what happens.

Amazon review: This is a very nice instrumental version of "God Bless America."  It's about Christmas, about how we should all love each other and have a good time.  I love the song.  The words are nice and the instrumentation is nice.  I am giving this one a good rating. I think it's a good song.

Amazon review: I'm really not a fan of Christmas music.  I don't really like it much, but I find it good for the holiday.  I love the words, the message, and the music.  It's a good song.

I love "God Bless America."

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

What I would like to say:

-I don't think I could take the pressure of reviewing this album again.  I am no fan of this band (except for the songs on the album).  I am also not too happy with the review of the album on Amazon.  As it is, I can't take another review of this album.

What I would have liked to say:

-I hate seeing reviews so negative.  It makes me sad to see reviews so negative.  I think it is important to help others find new music, so that they can listen to it without the pressure of critics' opinions.  I want to do my part, so that some other readers can discover new music and find new artists.  But I still don't think it's fair to the artists, just because they are not as positive as other reviewers.  I thought that the reviews on Amazon were very positive.  So I am not very happy with the review on Amazon, but I am also not as unhappy as I thought I would be.

I would like to thank all those who have already reviewed the album.  You already have given me some really nice feedback.  If you are interested in reviewing new albums, please go to my review page and check out my reviews.  I am always eager to give feedback about new albums.  Your feedback is really helpful to me.  I am always looking for new artists and new albums.  I am always looking for good reviewers.

Thank you very much for reading this review.  It means a lot to me.  I hope you will also read the original review about the album.  It has really good information, that you can use for your next review.  I hope it will be helpful for you.  It will give you the opportunity to discover new music, as well as new artists.  I hope you will also review my reviews.  I am always looking for reviewers.  Your feedback is really helpful to me.  Thank you very much for reading this review.  Really, really, really thank you.

This album is a great album, and I believe is better than the other reviews say.  I loved the cover art, I enjoyed the songs, and they all had a great message.  The album is a must own.

Overall, I would say this album is very powerful and has a great message.  I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to know about depression.

I love this album.  It is a very good album from the perspective of the reviewer.  If you are a fan of the band, you will enjoy the album.  But I thought that the reviewer might not like it.  I did not like the song "I Feel Better" and I did not like the song "I Don't Feel So Good" at all.  They were not good.  I also thought that the reviewer did not like the songs by the band, but I think that they were great.  They were just not written by the band, so I do not think that it is fair to judge the album only by the songs.  I think that it is a good album for everyone who has a hard time with depression.

Overall, I would say this album is a good album from the perspective of the reviewer.  If you are a music fan, you will enjoy the album.  I think that the reviewer might not like the album and he is quite right and they are not all good, but I think that the reviewer's review is correct.  The reviewer is not negative and he is also not right.

I love this album.  It is very good for anyone that has to deal with depression.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.

Review:

Hey Guys,

I like Tech N9ne for many different reasons, but this album, I just don't get. This album is just not my cup of tea. I don't understand why he put so many songs on this album. What's the point of a single? Why not just put one song on a CD? This is just one of those albums I know I will never be able to listen to. I wish I had listened to the album when it first came out, but I was too young back then. I have to admit though, that there are a few songs on the album I "get". I love the beat on the song "I got a feeling", I love the beat on the song "You+Me", and I like the beat on the song "I'll be waiting". I don't understand why he put so many songs on this album though.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Tech N9ne's latest album comes at a time when the world needs it. His new album is a mix of his old and new sound. Tech N9ne is a great artist that I've always enjoyed. This album is a great listen to. Tech N9ne has come to light in the last five years and I believe he has accomplished a lot. Tech N9ne is still one of the best, most consistent, and most original artists in the rap game. This is why I think he should be a household name. If you haven't heard his music, or you are just getting into it, check out his album "Be Still" and his album "How I Roll".

Amazon review: I've had this cd for a couple of months now and I've gone through it about six times.  I'm really surprised that I find this to be one of the better CDs  of this genre.  On the first listen, I was actually expecting a bit more of a "radio" sound but it's not that bad.  The music is a lot better than most of the other discs I've heard.  However, the CD is a little too long for my taste.  It's more than twice as long as the usual CD's I've heard.  The song selection is a little limited.  I could have easily spent the hour listening to the music of this CD and not been able to hear any of the dialogue.  The lyrics are written in a very limited number of languages (mostly English and Spanish) that I've not heard before.  I've heard Spanish lyrics before, but usually with language that is a little more difficult to understand (French, Italian, etc).  The Spanish lyrics are not hard to understand, but the English lyrics are a little hard to understand.  I don't know what language the lyrics are written in, but I've never heard anything that was like this before.  I've listened to several other CDs with a similar theme and found them to be much better than the first one.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this CD, the first thing that came to my mind was "What the hell is this?"  I was so shocked when I heard the voices of Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman talking to each other in this CD.  I tried to listen to it a second time to hear the whole thing.  I was shocked at how well they were singing.  The musical background and lyrics are amazing.  The first time I heard this CD, I thought that Anne Hathaway was a little too "hot" and I was thinking that the lyrics were a little too "cute" for me.  That was the first time that I ever thought about not buying this CD.  I listened to this CD the second time and I was just blown away by how good it sounded.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to hear a really good, musical CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was amazed at how bad the recording was on this CD.  I had been hearing the voices in the background of my office for two years.  The voice of Hugh Jackman is so much louder and clearer on this CD than in the other versions that I have heard.  The voice of Anne Hathaway in this CD is also much clearer than in the other versions that I have heard.  I was so surprised to hear this CD in my office.  For me, this CD was the first time that I heard someone else sing.  I have listened to this CD many times and each time I am amazed at how good it is.  I found myself listening to the lyrics to the songs to the songs.  They are all unique and fresh.  I really like them all.  The song "A Thousand Words" is very different from the others.  It is very sad, very emotional, very moving and very sweet.  The lyrics are very well written and the music is very good.  The song "Thank you for the memories" is very deep and very moving and very sad.  The song "You are everything" is very deep and very moving.  The lyrics are very well written and the music is very good too.  The song "You are the best part of me" is very deep and very moving.  The lyrics are very well done and the music is very good.  The song "You are the only one" is very deep and very moving.  The lyrics are well written and the music is very good too.  The song "Don't miss me" is very deep and very moving.  The lyrics are well written.  The music is very good too.  The song "Just one more chance" is very deep and very moving.  The lyrics are very well told.  The music is very good too.  The song "Just a single tear" is very deep and very moving.  The lyrics are very well sung and the music is very good too.

Amazon review: I have listened to this all over and over again.  I love the way that this cd sings.  It's the most beautiful, most romantic CD I have heard to date.  The song "One more time" is just beautiful.  It's a very deep, very moving song.  The lyrics are beautiful.  The music is very good too.  The song "Just want you to know" is very deep and very moving.  The lyrics are very well said.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

If you're the type of person that takes things that aren't perfect personally then you're probably a person that has been hurt, and it's hard to get over that.
Here's a story that I think illustrates just how easy it is to get caught up in the past and the negative emotions that it can bring up.
I was watching a movie with a friend the other day. I saw the movie, and I sat there, thinking back over what I'd just watched. I remembered the movie, where everything that happened in it was so perfect. I remembered how it ended perfectly for the characters that it was set up to show. I remember how the main character was about to reveal to the character's father that his son was gay. I remember how nothing bad ever happened to the main character, who was always kind, loving, and sweet. I remember how everything in the movie was so perfect.
Then I remembered the scene where the main character's best friend was trying to help him, and the main character had a breakdown. He was crying. He was angry. He was sad. He was crying. He was about to make a fool of himself. The friend tried to help him. He held him. He sang to him. He hugged him. But the main character didn't want to hear it.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!
