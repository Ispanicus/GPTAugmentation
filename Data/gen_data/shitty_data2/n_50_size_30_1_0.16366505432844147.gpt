Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: The CD opens with a lovely little song titled "I believe in you" which is sung by a male voice. The CD then goes on to include several songs that would make for a perfect Christmas album. If you are looking for something that is truly special, one that will be remembered by your children for years to come, then this would be the CD for you.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album's quality is definitely above average, but I can't say that I'm impressed. I definitely found something here that I was not expecting; Danzig's guitar playing is phenomenal. It's reminiscent of some of his earlier work. His riffs and solos are pretty creative, but the production quality is a letdown. It doesn't have the sound of a real studio recording, but it sounds good enough. When I compare this album to his other releases, it has the sound and feel of a studio recording but Danzig's vocals aren't as good as on other albums. Overall, I'm really disappointed in this album. This is one of his better albums.

I bought this album because I was a fan of Kelly's work.  But, after a few listens I realized that she is not the most talented vocalist out there.  I would rate her vocal talents as only average.  I bought this album because I thought her voice was a little different then other singers and because I liked the music.  But after a few listens I realized that she can not sing the way most artists sing.  She is not as good as others.  I wish her the best of luck.

Reviewer:

Kelly Ann Kelly is great, but she is not as good as some of the other singers. I do not know who her replacement should be, but she will have to make a good album and a good album will be done. I personally think that Kelly Ann and Kelly Ann Kelly should stick together as one. Kelly Ann Kelly and Kelly Ann Kelly.

I like this CD a lot.  Kelly Ann Kelly has nice vocals and a great voice, but her singing style is a bit like an older woman.  However, she really does have a nice, mellow voice.  The music is good and it is an interesting album.  I am glad that I read the author's comment that she has been through some difficult times, but she seems to be doing well.  Kelly Ann Kelly is a nice singer.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Not a good album in the least bit.

I think that, at it's best, it's the best of the opera.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was looking forward to the "Merry Widow" opera.  I've never heard this opera, so I thought I would give it a try.  The opera is a musical with 3 acts, each with a different story.  The second act is all about a man and a woman being in love.  The third act is about a man and a woman who are in love with each other.  The first act is a love story between a man and a woman, and the second act is all about a woman and a man.  I thought it sounded interesting and fun.  I was thinking to my self,  what's the difference between the 1st and 2nd act?  Well, a lot, as it turns out, as the 2nd act is much more of a love story, while the 1st act is more about the man and woman in love.  In fact, they are separated by only one scene.  I'm not the best fan of the opera 'The Merry Widow', I am not a fan of opera, but I thought this was a great opera that I would like to hear.  I thought all the singing was very beautiful, and I enjoy the different singing styles. I thought the story was very interesting and I thought the music was very good.  Then I stumbled across the title.  I thought the title was very interesting.  It's a very unique opera.  It's a unique musical that I thought was very well done.  The story is very interesting.  There is a lot of love and humor in the opera.  Also, in the opera, the characters can't stop talking to each other, and they have no trouble communicating in Italian.  It's a wonderful opera.  I'm very impressed with this opera.  I like the different styles of opera, I like the different characters, and I like the different styles of singing.  I have never heard opera in Italian, but I like the opera very much.  I thought it was very well done.  I don't enjoy opera, but I like this opera very much.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I don't know what made them think that they would get more success by changing their style, but it is a shame.  As an alternative rock band, it is nothing special.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I really want to support this group, but I don't know how to do it. This new album is horrible. They are not even trying to change it and they put out a bunch of garbage.

This is how they keep people coming back to their stupid website.

Amazon review: This album is so bad it is not even worth a listen. I have only been listening to the songs for a few hours and I am already bored to tears.

Amazon review: I'm starting to think this is the worst rap album in the history of rap music.  It's not very good and it doesn't have the same energy and flow as the others, but it's all about the hype.  This is the first album I have ever bought from this group. I am not sure if I'll be buying more albums from them because I don't think I can ever get a real good album like this.

Amazon review: I am very disappointed.  I have always loved rap music, but I never considered myself a rap artist.  I have loved Jay-Z and 50 and the first album by N.W.A.  I liked Eminem.  I thought he was great.  His voice was great, but I thought he was a little over the top.  I felt he was trying too hard.  Too much energy.  Too much energy.  So when he decided to take on the rap genre I was disappointed.  But when Jay-Z decided to take the same genre, I was very happy.  I have always been a fan of Jay-Z.

Amazon review: A great album.  I've been a fan of R. Kelly since his first album.  I'm not sure if anyone can say that he hasn't been a great artist since then.  I just don't think he's had an album that has been as great as this.  Even though this album has some of the same beats as the others, it has a very different feel.  He used to rap about being a drug addict and being on drugs, but now he is a singer and he uses his personal life to tell a story about what it is like to be a drug addict and what it is like to be a drug addict.  He uses his life as a story to tell about what everyone goes through.  I love how he talks about his addictions and he tells the story that he has been through.  I've been through some of the same things and he had a way of putting it all into words that I could relate to and I can't wait to see what he has to say next.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is the best album I have ever heard.  I was very dissapointed with this album.  I have been a fan of R. Kelly for a while now and I thought it would be a good album to start with.  I love the first track, but I think the rest of the album was a little too much.  I have heard other albums that are a little too much but not this one.  I also love that the beats are different.  I love when artists use new beats and new beats to put in their songs.  It makes it seem different and I am sure it shows the artists talent.  Some people would say that this album is pop music and that they are using pop radio.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: The music of this album is very good and I would say that the whole album is just too long, I feel like I just can't take it.  I feel like I need a break after listening to it for a while.  The other three songs I like are The First Time, I'm Still Alive, and A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square.  The other three songs, I would not consider my favorites, but I do like them.  I was having a hard time deciding which song to listen to first.  The first song, I'm Still Alive, sounded very nice to me.  The music is nice and has a lot of different tones.  The second song, The First Time, is a great blues song, and the last two songs, A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square, and Last Night On The Town, are just great, and I would love to go out and listen to them all night.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I think they should have put something on the back of the cd that says "This CD was designed to promote the movie 'The Matrix.'  It doesn't."  That would have done the trick.  My opinion.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

I am an old school rap fan. I really like tracks like "Rage", "Rising Up" and "Razor Sharp". I really like the way they used the beat (that was so great). I thought all of the songs were great. I think the production on this album is better than the last album.

Amazon review: If you’re looking for a great album to listen to during the Christmas season, then you’ve probably come to the right place.  Meghan Trainor delivers a great mix of R&B, pop and country that reminds me of the hits from her debut.  The album does get a little repetitive at times, but I think Meghan Trainor is just fine with that.  This is definitely a must buy from Meghan Trainor.  And I don’t mean that as a slight.  I mean it as a compliment.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Meghan Trainor since the days of “Sweetener” and “Work From Home.”  Now that she’s started her own label, her work is getting much more exciting.  What I have to say is positive.  Her music is great, she has a great voice, and her songs are easy to listen to.  She’s also a talented artist.  I have many of her albums and I love them all!  But this album is a step back from the previous ones.  The album just doesn’t interest me like it used to.  I’m looking forward to her next album.

I am pleased with this album, but it needs a little more help.  I don't think it is bad, but there are some good songs but it has a few songs that are repetitive or just not that great.

I have listened to all of them and bought copies of each of them.  I had not heard the "Notorious B.I.G. LP" before.
