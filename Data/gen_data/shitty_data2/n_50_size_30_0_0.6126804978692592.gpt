Music reviewers have been writing on Amazon about the song "The Greatest Love of All" by the Rolling Stones. Here's what they have to say:

"The greatest love of all"

By The Rolling Stones

With all of the heartache, pain and personal tragedy that has occurred over the years I have not really heard a song that could possibly capture all the love I have ever felt for someone. No matter how hard I try it seems to have gone too quickly.

So when I heard this song on my walk to school this morning I decided to listen to it over and over until it meant something to me. It was so beautiful and felt like someone was touching my soul. I could feel the love that I have had for someone and I could hear the love that I have lost.

If you love someone and you haven't had a chance to tell him how you feel just know that I have. I love you, baby.

The song was on my walk to school today and I listened to it over and over until I felt like it meant something. I hope this inspires you to love someone today. I hope they feel it too.

The song was written by Mick Jagger.

Amazon Review: I really like this song. I purchased it, but I could not listen to it because it was too short and repetitious. It

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: I was really excited for this album, I was so happy with the news that the song "What You Waiting for" (Which was cut from the album because it felt like a filler) would be on the album.

Amazon review: i really love this album, this is one of the albums that will always stay in my collection, I love this song "One Way Ticket" and I think the one thing that is missing from this album is the last song "I am not going to sit here and let you get away with killing me", I am not sure who recorded the song, I think it may have been The Killers or something, but the song is really good and it is one of my favorite songs of the year.

I went into this album with expectations, and I was not disappointed. This album is pure magic. The album is very inspirational, and it's incredibly moving. You will not be disappointed by this album. The production on this album is second to none, and I love the lyrics, they are so true and full of truth. This album is without a doubt my favorite album of the year.

Amazon review:"Crazy" really shows how much I've grown as a person, and how much I've grown as a musician. I really appreciate your honesty that you're not going to tell me your life in 4 minutes, but I feel like I've heard a lot of things from you in the past few months, and it has made me a lot more mature. I'm really glad to have met you, and I really appreciate everything you have done for my life so far, and for me to continue to be who I am, I have to love myself, and to love myself, that's the only way I am able to love the people around me, and I've met some great people this year, people who really make you want to be more, and to be more, if you're not loving yourself, then there is no point in loving anyone else, and I think that that needs to be told. Thanks for giving me the courage to be who I am, and to be who I am.

I think the song could be a great radio/band song if someone could come up with some different instrumentation and arrangement to make it more interesting.  But the lyrics are just so boring.  They are uninteresting.  The lyrics are about how the singer would have sex with whoever, and then someone says, "no, I don't want to have sex with someone who has sex with someone who has sex with someone, and someone says, "well then I guess it doesn't matter who it is".  That is just boring.  Maybe they should have put a different word in the lyrics, like "somebody" or "someone", or "there" or "someone...".  It would have made the song better.  Maybe they could have put some different instrumentation to make it more interesting.  But the vocals are just so bad.  They are uninteresting.  The lyrics are boring.

Music Review:
I have a few problems with this album, especially the second song The Best of the Best.  The first song I have a problem with is The Best of the Best, I am not a fan of the sound of the song and it makes me cringe.  I know I am not the only one who feels this way, I have a few friends who also don't like this song.  I mean I really like it, I am just not a fan of the sound of the song and I am not a fan of the vocals of the singer.  I also have a problem with the lyrics, I just find them to be uninteresting.  I mean, why would the song be about someone's first love when that person dies on the next note?  It should be about the best of the best, then the rest of the song is about the second best.  It is just a waste of time.  I also have a problem with the song The Best of the Best, I am not a fan of the sound and it makes me cringe.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

"I'm on a mission with your God" - Eminem

Eminem has written "I'm on a mission with your God" over and over again.  This is a song about how even though things are bad in your life, this is not the end of the road.  God is still in control, and even though he is on a mission with your life, he still loves you.  He will not let you down.  He does not give up on you.  He will never let you down.

There is a chorus in this song.  I can't remember the lyrics, but it goes like this:

"I'm on a mission with your God/ I'm on a mission with your God/ I'm on a mission with you God."

This is a good verse in the song.  There is another verse that goes like this:

"Take my hand in your hand/ take my hand in your hand/ I'll be your hand in your hand."

This is a good verse in the song.  It is like a prayer that goes something like this:

"Take my hand in your hand/ take it in your hand/ I'll be your hand in your hand."
"Take my heart in your heart/ take it in your heart/ I'll be your heart in your heart."

I can't remember what these verses mean.  I am not a rapper and I can't understand what he is saying at all when he is singing these verses.  I think it is a prayer to God.  It is the same prayer that the person who wrote the song gives to God.  It is a good prayer, but not the best prayer in the world.

There is another verse in the song that goes like this:

"I don't want to be like everyone else/ I don't want to be like everyone else/ I don't want to leave the world like they do."

I don't understand this verse.  It sounds like Eminem is saying that he doesn't want to be just like everyone else.  He is saying that he wants to be an individual.  He wants to be a special person.  He wants to be different from everyone else.

There is a bridge in this song.  It goes like this:

"Now I'll show you why I'm on a mission with your God/ I'll now show you why I'm on a mission with your God/ I'll be your hand in your hand now."

I don't know what this means.  It sounds like Eminem is telling the listener to stop being negative.  He is telling the listener to stop being down.  He is telling the listener to start being positive.  He is telling the listener to stop being negative and start being positive.  His

Amazon review: I have a friend who is a western fan. I asked him if he had heard this western. He said "this western is a good western." I have listened to it many times, and it is a good western. It is not a western, but a collection of other western songs. Although I do like the western, I can not recommend it.

Amazon review: Don't be fooled by the picture. This is great classical music to listen to anytime. I really like it and found that it relieves my stress at work. This was well worth the 99 cent pricetag.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: These guys are great, but not for the mainstream audience.  They are like a mixture of the Beatles and the Beach Boys, a little more laid back. Although I wish they would give us some more songs, (I am not a big fan of their albums), I would have given a little more bang for their buck.  Oh well.  I will wait to see if the next CD is any better.  
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The band is an interesting fusion of country, rock, folk and blues.  Their sound is good, but the lyrics are just mediocre.  I am not a big fan of the band and have tried listening to them only once.  I think they are one of the few bands that can "rock out" and make a decent album.  They are not a band I would want to hear for the rest of my life.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to say that this band is one of the most annoying and worst I have ever heard.  The lyrics are so bad and cheesy, that you can't even understand most of the songs.  I really do not want to put this on my mp3 player.  It is like listening to a band that is trying to be the "big boys" like The Clash and then they drop the ball with the lyrics.  Now, I have listened to them for hours, and I have not gotten bored.  Maybe because I do not have any other band to listen to.  I wish I had never heard them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I thought this was a very good album.  I really enjoyed it.  This album was one of the first albums that I liked.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is what I consider an "all-around" live recording.  I like the band, the vocals, and the instrumentation (all I really care about).  The live recording is the best I have heard.  I am giving it four stars because it is so-so, if you are looking for a live recording that is close to studio quality, then this is not the record for you.  The drums on the recording are not very good.  I don't know if it is the gear or the recording, but they are not great.

Amazon review:  This album is an interesting experience. It is a little weird at first because it seems like they are trying to be so hard to be different. That is a good thing. The first 3 tracks are really good. They are very different and interesting. Then after that it becomes more repetitive and hard. I had to listen to them twice in order to fully enjoy them. I gave it a negative because it is repetitive but it is really good. I really like it. The only thing is, I think it is a little bit boring. I would like them to get back to the main theme of the album. I love the idea that they are trying so hard to be different. It is a little bit boring. They should come up with a new theme. I really liked that. The only thing that was bad about it was the repetitive patterns. It is repetitive, but maybe it is intentional to save on time, or maybe in the digital version it is repetitive. It was a little bit annoying for me to hear those patterns in the digital version. The theme is good, but it could be better. It is different and interesting, but it could be better.  I like it.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Buy a tour t-shirt. 4. Buy a tour t-shirt. 5. Buy a tour t-shirt.  This is what I wanted to do but I didn't as I had a lot of money tied up in a real estate deal.  On my way to the concert, I got a text from my man telling me he had a surprise for me...a surprise I am sure I want to keep to myself.  I am not sure what this surprise is but the best thing I could do is to let you just enjoy the concert and let us enjoy our vacation on the beach and not worry about what we have in store for us.

Amazon review: When I was growing up in the 80's, I loved rap music.  It was the only music I could listen to on my Walkman.  I used to go to my friend's house to listen to the music.  I would listen to hip hop and rap.  There was a lot of different type of music I remember listening to, I was a kid.  I remember the first time I heard the song "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" on the radio.  It was the first time I realized that I liked rap music, It was a game changer.  I was hooked.  I remember when I was growing up and my parents bought me a Walkman.  I would listen to rap music and listen to 90's hip hop.  A lot of my friends listened to rap music.  I remember playing the CD player in my room.  I listened to hip hop and rap music.  I remember listening to NWA.  I remember listening to NWA and listening to this group named Mobb Deep.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: If you're going to start a band and be in it for the long haul, you're not going to be able to go through a 5 year break in between albums either.  This is a good album.  It's all about his mood swings.  I think he gets a bad rap, but I think he's just misunderstood sometimes.  I think he's the real deal.  He is a good musician.  I listen to his albums when I want to kill somebody.  He has a nice voice too, so if you're a fan of rap rock, give this a listen.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was a fan of this band way before they got to be one of the big guns in the world, and they were one of the few bands that I actually felt were able to do something different.  When I heard they were going to be releasing an album, I was kind of bummed.  It was supposed to be a double CD with a full studio album, a collection of unreleased tracks, and a few live tracks.  I didn't think I'd be blown away by it, but I was.  I felt like they took a risk that I thought was really important.  I thought it was an excellent album, filled with great songs and great talent.  I wish they had stuck with it.  I don't think I'll ever buy another cd from them, but I certainly will buy their records.  They are a band that I feel will grow to be a big deal.
