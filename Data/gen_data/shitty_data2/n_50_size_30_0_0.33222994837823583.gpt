Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:
This is a great album, I wish they had recorded more.  They are very traditional in the way they play and write and you can tell that is in their blood.  They play a traditional style of music that sounds good.  I will continue to listen to their music.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this CD was in a "house" CD store.  And I had one other thing to worry about besides my money, which was that my CD player would explode.  So I bought it.  Then I started thinking about how I could play it.  I didn't own an amp, a mixer, or a synth.  And even if I did, I was afraid to even touch it.  So I just listened to it on my CD player, hoping for the best.  It turned out ok, except for the lyrics.  They were atrocious.  The music was very good, but the lyrics were so bad that I could not even listen to it any more.  I think the lyrics were probably written by the band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: So, I found the music and the lyrics fascinating.  I was really digging the mix of folk and blues and country and rock and roll.  I mean, I liked the music and the lyrics, but I couldn't stand the lyrics.  I thought they were too simplistic, too easy, and too banal.  They could have been more profound.  And the songs just did not have a lot of variety and variety just did not seem to be a part of the mix.  I also really did not like the guitar solos.  I guess I just felt like I was hearing a bunch of different music with the same instrumentation and the same vocals.  So I thought that I would give it a try, and I did.  And I liked it.  And it seems to be a band that I really will have to check out more often.  I'm definitely going to buy their CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like the acoustic and electric guitar sound.  I like the bluesy sound.  I like the folk sound.  I really enjoy the singing.  But the lyrics are the worst I've ever heard.  They are so negative and they just make me feel like I'm being preached to by a bunch of bigoted ignorant white people.  I've never heard such negative, stereotypical lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was really looking forward to the next album, but I didn't like it at all.  It was really boring.  I thought it was going to be a lot more exciting.  But it was just boring.  It was just sort of a repetition of what I already liked.  I will still go back, but maybe not at a high volume.  The album is very good though, and I will continue to listen.

Amazon review: I like your review.  I agree with everything you said.  I really do.  I mean, the folk sound is really interesting.  The folk sound is very similar to the guitar and the vocals.  And I think the band is really good.  But I don't think the lyrics are that bad.  I don't think they are as bad as you say.  They are just not that interesting.  I think the lyrics are really simple and they don't go anywhere.  I think you should try and listen to other lyrics.  The lyrics on the other CDs you buy sound much better than the lyrics on this one.  I don't want to sound negative, but I just think the lyrics are very simple and you don't really see that much of the band's personality in the lyrics.  I just don't know if you should be listening to this album.  I think you should still buy it.  But I think it's better than what I've heard.  But overall, I think you should listen to the other albums if you haven't yet.  But I think this one is good.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is the first recording of a complete recording of the complete works of Debussy.  I think Debussy would have been surprised.   This is a very good recording,  the piano works on the CD are in the same style as the complete works.  The recording of the complete works is a very good recording,  as well as the French songs.  The songs are very good and  the recording is very good.

Amazon review: A good recording.  I was very pleased with her playing.  I like many of the songs on this CD and they were all in good taste.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in Debussy.  I found it very disappointing that the recording of the complete works was not a better quality.  I was also disappointed that I did not get to listen to the complete works.  I would have liked to hear the complete works.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

However, it is still a great album that is highly recommended to those who like to listen to a lot of acoustic music. The only other problem is that it's not a Christmas album.

If you go to my profile and click on the "My Favorites" tab at the left side of the page, you'll see that I have a bunch of songs I've listened to a lot, and a couple of songs that I've really enjoyed.

This is my first time doing a musical album review, so I'll be writing a bit more about the songs than I normally would, but I hope you'll find this album enjoyable.

This music is very easy on the ears, so if you're worried about your ears not being able to handle some of the instrumental parts, I hope this album helps you relax and have a good time!

I've been listening to this album for quite a long time, and I've been enjoying it for a while.

This album contains 4 instrumental songs, and 1 song that is sung. The instrumental songs are great, and I can't wait to hear the rest of the album, but I'll wait until I can't wait any longer to hear the songs.

The vocals are alright, but they aren't as good as the instruments.

I would recommend this album to people who like instrumental music, people who like songs that can be sung or played in the background, people who like the slow music genre, and people who like songs that have a positive uplifting message.

I like this album.

This is a pretty good album.

I would recommend this album to people who like instrumental music. I think it would be a good collection for people who like instrumental music.

This album is a pretty good album.

I would recommend this album to anyone who likes instrumental music. It is a pretty good album, and I've been enjoying it for a while.

I would recommend this album to people who like instrumental music and like songs that have a positive uplifting message.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: I just wanted to say that I have been listening to Danzig since I was about 12. I am 66 now and I have read everything I can get my hands on on Danzig and his music. I have been a Christian for 30 years, I am very involved in the Church and the music of Danzig always brings me back to a time in my life when God was very close to me. I just wanted to say thank you.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I received this CD and listened to it for about 10 minutes before I decided I wanted to return it to Amazon. It's a nice album, but the only song I really liked was "Let The Worshipers Arise" by the group New River.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have no idea what to say about this album.  This is the same album as the previous Revel album.  The only difference is the vocals are a little softer.  I bought this song in the hopes of hearing the songs used on the next  Revel album.  It's really not worth the money.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: What can I say about this album.  I am not fond of it.  I was thinking of buying the entire album but my friend convinced me to buy the previous Revel album just for the vocals.  I am not fond of that either.  I do like the vocals but the drums are a bit too fast.  I think the guitars on the album are too loud.  The vocals are a little softer when compared to the previous Revel album.  There are good songs on this album but overall I am disappointed.

I just wish I could have heard the first Revel album.  I hope Revel releases another one.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the old Revel albums, but I have always enjoyed the newer ones.  I bought this because it was one song I had never heard before.  The song, What the f### is It, is a fast paced, loud rock song.  It has a good message about how we can't be friends with people who are not family.  I have been with my boyfriend for 11 years, and he has always been a good friend, so what the f### is it?  Well, you can never be friends with someone who you love.  However, I think the song is catchy, and I like the fact that it takes the lyrics to a new level.

Product: This is not the accapella. I purchased it because someone wrote that it was in fact the acapella but that is not correct.

This is the recording you can listen to on your computer, and the vocals are quite good but not amazing. It has a fairly simple arrangement which is easy to understand but still very interesting.

The backing is pretty solid with the piano and violin and the background vocals are very nice. The piano is quite good and has a nice mellow tone. The violin is also quite good.

The vocal part is not perfect. It's almost a wimpy version of the original recording (the original has many more dynamic changes and is better), but the arrangement is good and the vocals are clear.

The recording is decent overall. The arrangement is simple, the backing is solid and the vocals are quite clear.

This CD was not worth the 99 cent price tag.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: The album is a mixed bag, and I can't really say I enjoyed it. I know it's not a huge stretch, but I think it's more of a filler album. I don't know whether it's for the same reason as the song "Dirty Laundry" which I thought was okay, but the tracks aren't very good.

Overall, I think Eminem is an amazing musician. He is a genius with his guitar and voice. I don't know what it is about him and his ability to make a good music.
For me, I could listen to every song on this album by myself. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone else.
I can't really say anything about the lyrics on this album. It's like he's not writing lyrics. The subject matter is very generic. I don't know if it's because he's not a very good lyricist or what it is, but he just says what he thinks. So if you're looking for something to listen to, I suggest you listen to "L

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: If you are a jazz fan, this album is a must have.  If you are not a jazz fan, you will probably like it because it is an album of great music.  I have been listening to this album for a few years and have learned a lot about Jazz by listening to it, and I never would have known that this is an album named "The Last Waltz" if it wasn't for the liner notes.  The liner notes are filled with interesting, informative, and important information about the history of Jazz.  This album is a great introduction to Jazz.

Amazon review: I have loved this band for many years now.  Even as I sit here, almost 40 years after the first time I heard them, the music still thrills me.  This is one of the most entertaining albums I have ever heard, probably because it is full of great songs.  This band can make you laugh, and make you think.

Amazon review: I first heard this group when I was about 11 years old, and it is still the only group I like.  This is a great group, and a great album.  I have found that this band is one of the best.  I have been a fan of this group for years.

Amazon review: When I hear jazz in the evening, my favorite artists are: Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, Stan Getz, Ella Fitzgerald, Art Blakey, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, John Coltrane, and Herbie Hancock.  This album has all of those artists on it.  This album is a great deal.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The music was brilliant.  The choir was great, the musicians were great, the lyrics were amazing.  The only thing that was missing was my brother in arms.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This album is absolutely stunning.  You can hear the beauty in the music that is not apparent at first listen.  The choir singing is beautiful and the music is truly anthemic.  There is something about listening to music in a church that makes you feel like you are actually part of the action instead of just hearing the music.  I don't think this album is for everyone but it is great if you like good clean music and want to know more about religion and spirituality.  The choir is great as is the musicians playing the instruments well and are talented.  The lyrics are also beautiful and the lyrics touch on topics that are very important to me.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  When I first heard the album there was a little bit of fear on my part,  especially considering the name of the artist who created the music.  I am a huge fan and have listened to the album 5 or 6 times.  It is not just the music but the lyrics are brilliant,  I have to admit that there are some words that come to mind when I think of the artist that will be heard by many a listener.  I have also watched the artist's videos and seen his video on youtube,  I don't think he is a bad artist,  he is just not my type of artist.  All in all I have to say this is one of my favorite pieces of music that I have heard and I have been a fan for a long time.  The CD was worth the money and I think it will be worth the money to anyone who has a sense of spirituality and is open minded enough to listen to the artist.  I give this album 7 out of 10.

Amazon review:  This CD is beautiful.  The choir singing is really great,  the only thing that could have been better is the CD.  The CD was a little bit too much for me,  but the music was great.

I give this CD 3 out of 10.

Amazon review:     I have listened to this CD a good amount and I enjoy listening to it.  The album is well written and the music goes along with the album.

Amazon review:   I have never heard anything that is so powerful as this music,  I have listened to it for about an hour,  then I put it on and it just hits you in the heart every time.  The lyrics are beautiful and the music is beautiful.  The voices and the arrangements have a lot of depth and emotion to them.  The message is very important and I believe that it is very relevant to people of all faiths and non-faiths.  The choir singing is also great I have to give it a 9 out of 10.

Amazon review of the CD:  It is a great concept album,  the fact that this was recorded live in a church is pretty cool.  The album is very well written,  it is not easy to write a simple message in a simple way,  and it has been done many times.  The choir singing is also very good,  even though they may not be in the same style,  they are still good.  The music is very good,  the arrangements are superb and the lyrics are very interesting.  Overall it is a very good album and worth the purchase.

Amazon review:   This is one of the most beautiful albums  I have heard in a long time.  It is not a rock album like a lot of rock music is,  there are a few rock songs,  but the majority of the album is very beautiful and very peaceful.   The choir singing is also very good and the arrangements are very good.  The lyrics are very meaningful and the message is very true.  In the end I would have to give this album a 9 out of 10.

Amazon review: This is the very first CD I've bought for my sister!  I'm not sure, but I think she's been waiting more than 30 years for this CD.  This is a very emotional CD because she has lost her mother and her father is very sick and she just got engaged.  The lyrics are touching about what it means to lose someone very close to you.  I thought the music was beautiful, but I just don't have the same feeling that she does.  I think it was very difficult for her to sing because she was very emotional and she was crying a lot.  I just don't want to listen to this CD again.  I wish it was made by another singer.  I also wish that she would sing more songs that she has written.  I think it's very easy for her to sing.

She has been singing for more than 10 years, but I only saw one concert.  Now I'm going to see all her concerts.  I think it's very difficult for her to sing because she is very emotional and she is crying a lot.  I just don't want to listen to this album again.  I just want to listen to it with my sister because I don't want to listen to it with other people.  I don't want to listen to this album on my own.  I just want to know what the song is about because I want to know what she is going to sing to me.  I just can't listen to this album anymore.  I just don't want to listen to it anymore.

Amazon review: I saw this movie when I was a teenager.  It was a great movie.  It had a message I didn't get at the time and I have come to appreciate it as an adult.  I'm glad the music has done the rest of the talking for me.  The way the song is played in it's entirety is just so well done and I really enjoy it.  I'm surprised at how good it is.  I will continue to listen to it over and over.  It has been my go to song for quite a while.  I listen to it now and then just to hear it again.  It is always the same.  I was surprised at how true it is and how moving it is.  If you are a fan of the movie then you will love the song.  I believe it's on the soundtrack.  I don't know when I will be able to purchase the rest of the soundtrack as I don't think my library will support it.  I have been a fan of the song for a long time and just wasn't ready to see it on the soundtrack.  I'm glad I heard it in the movie.  I never thought about it until the day my dad saw it and said he would give me a copy of the soundtrack if I would go see it.  He did.  It was a nice way of saying thanks for the music I've been listening to all these years.  I have listened to it numerous times and I still enjoy it.  I hope there is a soundtrack album out soon.  I would love to get a copy of this album.  I haven't seen the movie in a long time but I will watch it again.  I may not like it as much as I used to.  But I will still buy it.  It was a good movie.  It has a message and I believe it will come through in the music.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: First time I heard this CD, I was impressed with it.  This band is amazing, and I really like their music.  They sound a little too much like "The Verve".  They sound like they are having fun and playing for their own good and not for anyone else's.  I got in a fight with a couple who were standing on the corner and started yelling to me that I should listen to this band because they were better than the Verve.  I don't disagree.  They are very good.  They are the second most popular band on the internet.  These guys are definitly on the same level of fame as The Verve.  I will admit that I have never heard a band like this before.  This band is the only band on the internet that I can listen to from their CD.  This band is very talented with their music and they are extremely talented musicians. Thalia is definitely a very talented artist.  Thalia is definitly better than The Verve (I love The Verve), and I would not have guessed she'd be as talented as The Verve is.  I would highly recommend this band to everyone.
