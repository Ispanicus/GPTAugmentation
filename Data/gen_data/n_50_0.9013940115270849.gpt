Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: A nice little set, but I wish the guitar player played some blues.  There are enough blues players who don't play the blues as much as they should.  This is a nice little collection with some blues and some pop.  Music to listen to while sitting by the pool.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Liked the songs, but I would love to see the guitar player play a blues in this set.  I know this is probably just me, but this was a nice, soft set.  I would love to see a real blues player on this set, someone who can play a song like 'Blue Moon' or 'In the Midnight Hour'.  You have to be a real blues player to play a song like this.  Even with the acoustic guitar I would like to hear the electric guitar.  And some of the songs need electric guitar.  But if it was a real blues player I would have a problem with that.  My advice to the producer of this set, just add a band and some real blues and it will sell.  I would not have bought it if I had known it was just a set of songs that I liked.  I will not buy another set from this artist.  The songs are good, but the guitar player was not a blues player.  I hope the next set has a real blues guitarist!

Amazon review: I love this album, but I would have liked to hear Bob sing a little bit of his own songs.  This is a nice collection with some great songs.  When Bob Johnson sings, it is one of the best voices I have heard.  But for the most part he sings in a very southern manner.  I like the music, but I like to hear the vocals.  I know his voice was better, but it is hard to believe.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this CD on the recommendation of a friend.  It was very good.  I have to admit the music is not my favorite.  But I needed something to listen to while I was at work.  The songs are nice.  The guitar player was great.  I really like all of the songs.  The only problem was the background vocals.  They should have been left out.  I could have done without them.  That is my only complaint.

Amazon review: I bought it for my mom.  She loves Bob and wants to hear him.  I don't want to give the wrong impression about Bob, so I am writing this review.  This is a nice collection of Bob's songs.  He has a nice voice.  Just try to ignore the background vocalist.  It was a little annoying.  I have been a fan of Bob for a long time, and I must admit, he is a nice guy.  I hope to hear him sing some of his own songs, but he does not sing them very often.  I really like this CD.  I plan on buying the next CD.  I don't need to hear Bob sing songs that are very similar to the songs on this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD was a disappointment.  The songs are all good.  I was especially disappointed with the songs that were not recorded in Bob's own studio.  He really sounds great on his own recordings, but I would have preferred to hear the songs with his own voice.  I do not like the songs that are not his own in the set.  I hope to hear some of his songs played live, but I have not heard him play them live.  This is not a bad CD at all, but I would not recommend it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I did not like this CD.  The songs were all good, but I was disappointed with the lack of originality in the songs.  I have heard some Bob Johnson recordings and they are all good, but this version does not come close to the quality of a real live recording.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

"[...] is a testament to the power of the musical force that is the R.Kelly album. The album is more than an album as it is a celebration of life. The best way to understand the entire thing is to listen to it. This album will take you through the life of the artist and his family, and the power of the songs on this album is in the way the music is sung, not in the way the lyrics are sung. A lot of the time, the lyrics are about what is going on in the life of the artist, but the music is what makes the album. The songs are powerful, beautiful and real. You can almost feel the pain of life in his songs, and in the songs as a whole."

Not a good album in the least bit.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this album, and am very disappointed. I would have preferred a more cohesive album. Too much filler and not enough substance. The songs are very good, but have very little energy or enthusiasm. The production is extremely good, with very clear, well-defined vocals. I also love the interplay between the three members, and all three are very different. It's a very cohesive album. The only negative is the mediocre instrumental music that is over-produced and very annoying.

The beats are tight, the flow is smooth and the production is very solid.  Even though this album is very solid and has many great songs, I feel like the beats are a little bit on the thin side.  Other than the beats, this album is a great example of how two different producers can come together and make a great album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I have to agree with this. This is the worst album by him.  The worst by him.

ricky_thorn:

Thank you for the review.

I can't believe you just told me that.  You can't believe it?

Here is the link to the album so you can listen to it yourself.

It doesn't have the song "I Just Wanna Live" in it.  It also doesn't have the song "Won't Be Lonely" in it.  But it does have "Somewhere In Time".

I will let you know if you buy the album.  It is on Amazon.  There is a $1.00 charge for Amazon, so if you buy it on Amazon it will be $1.00.  So you will either pay $1.00 or you will get the album for free.

I hope you bought the album.  I liked some of it.  But I like it a lot less than I think you will.

I would like to hear more of his songs.  I would like to pay for his music.

I will let you know when that happens.  I will let you know when I buy the album.

I hope you buy the album.  I hope you buy the album so you can hear it.

I don't know what I am going to do.  I bought the album.  I will let you know when that happens.  I will let you know if you buy the album.

ricky_thorn:

This is the album I bought on CD.  I never bought the CD.  I just bought the album.  I don't know when I am going to buy the album.

So now you have to tell me how you are going to buy the album.  I will let you know when I buy the album.  I hope you buy the album.

I hope you buy the album so you can hear it.  When you buy the album, I will let you know.

Thank you.

No.  I bought the album.  I don't know when I am going to sell it.

Thank you!  Thank you!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album to listen to on the train or by your computer.    I think that a lot of people would be happy if just one person would like it.

Amazon review: I've had this CD for a few months now and I am still enjoying it.    I don't know if it's the music itself or the fact that it is an "unplugged" album.  I don't listen to music as much as I used to before I stopped.  When I do listen to music I usually listen to the songs as I write them.  It's like a meditative experience.  And I'm not a person who needs to hear music to get in a good mood or to get my mind off of something.

Amazon review: I really like this album.    I like the song "I'm Always There" because it is upbeat and positive.  But I also think that some of the songs are a little bit redundant.    I also like the fact that it is an "unplugged" album.    I'm not sure if other albums are "unplugged", but this album is one of the few that I feel represents the best of the "unplugged" concept.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is great.  I agree with the other reviewers that the repetitious nature of the songs make it uninteresting to listen to while driving.    However, the repetitious nature of the songs is actually beneficial to me.  The repetition, allows my mind to focus on the main theme of each song.    This is a good album for the listener that likes the repetition.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I would consider this to be an "unplugged" album.    It's very simple.  I don't need music to get me to sleep.    I prefer not to listen to music around me during the day.    I like listening to music while I am driving.  It allows me to listen to the songs.  I'm not a music person at all.    I don't have a CD player in my car.    This album is not the type of album that I would listen to while driving.  I think that if you are looking for an "unplugged" album, this is not it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was a little disappointed in this album.    I feel that it is a little bit redundant.  The main theme is repeated in each song rather than moving to the next one.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a very good song that was originally written by Neil Sedaka and does not sound like a "dance-pop" song.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I like some of the songs, while the others are not as good as I thought they would be.  There is such a thing as over thinking things, so I will probably listen to it again.  The second half of the album is a little better.    When he is on the level his music is at, I think he is one of the best lyricists to ever come out of the genre. I think some of the songs on this album could use more work, but overall it is a good album that is worth buying.

Amazon review: Good song. I listened to this when I was a kid, and hearing it again really brought back memories. Was afraid it was not going to hold up in these days, but it's still like I remembered.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Don't be fooled by the picture. This is great classical music to listen to anytime. I really like it and found that it relieves my stress at work. This was well worth the 99 cent pricetag.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Don't waste your money on a bimbo who supports cop killers.  Music was awful. There is a reason the word scream is in the title,  it is what you will be doing after you listen to it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm glad I didn't listen to the song because the entire album was awful.  My whole life, I've heard of Meghan Trainor and I've always wished I could sing her songs but I never knew she felt this way.  Not because she is a mean or rude person, but because her music is so beautiful for a girl who could have so much more. I was disappointed but it was also disturbing because Meghan Trainor is a very talented songwriter and it's sad that people don't get that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album.  I don't know why, but I was always interested in Meghan Trainor and I was always going to buy her album.  The album is very well produced and it sounds good.  The only problem I have is that I just don't like the songs.  The songs are repetitive, and I really don't like repetitive music.  I would have liked to have heard more songs from the album.  I think Meghan Trainor will have a good career and I think she has a lot to offer the world.  I guess I just need to hear songs that I like.  I just hope she will make more music that I like.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought Meghan's CD earlier in my collection and was excited to listen to it.  She is a very talented lady and I think this album will do very well.  I have been listening to some of her older songs and I love them.  Meghan Trainor, I have no idea what you are doing.  I have listened to your songs and it seems you have a really bad voice.  You sound like a homeless person who sings,  do you ever consider moving on?  The songs on this album are good, I just hate that you are a bad singer.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a friend who has a very good voice.  I have listened to her album and she sounded amazing.  This album sounds like something that comes from a homeless person who was trying to get a job at McDonalds.  This album sounds like it was written by a guy who lives in a tent and sings in his sleep.  This album would not have been enjoyable to me if I didn't have a friend who has a good voice.

Amazon review: I like to listen to your albums.  I have been listening to your songs for a long time.  I love your music,  but this is not the type of music I listen to.  It's sad because you seem to be using your voice to sell a product.  It's like you are making money, but I don't buy products.  The only song on this album that I liked was "Don't Let It Go."  I really think you need to be more creative.  You have a great voice,  don't use it to sell a product.  The album is great,  but I think I will be listening to more of your older albums.  Please, do more of your newer songs.  I like your music,  but I think you need to become more creative.  You have a great voice,  but don't use it to make money.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was disappointed.  I expected it to be better than I expected.  I didn't expect it to sound like this.  This album is very bad.  The first song I listened to was "Take a Chance on Me" and I was disappointed.  I didn't like the song and it made me feel worse.

One of my favorite Christmas songs! I have to say that I really like Ray Benson's Christmas music, and this song is a great example of it. It is very fun, and I really like the way Ray Benson sings it. It's upbeat and fun to sing. I like how he tells the story about Santa Claus coming to the home of "Little Jack" and giving him a very special gift. This song is definitely a Christmas song I would like to sing to my children.

This is a pleasant and catchy Christmas song that has a good message to convey in it. The lyrics of this song are very positive and uplifting. This song is very memorable and I am sure it will always be in my Christmas music collection.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
