Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: An original song by a great songwriter.  I like the way he handles the production and lyrics.  The recording is solid and the recording quality is good.  The vocals on the song are very good, but the production is weak.  There is a lot of unnecessary distortion which only serves to make the song appear less than it truly is.  The song doesn't have the power of the "Dynamite" song, however the song is still a good one.  The song tells a tale about trying to get over a loss, through the love that he has for another person.  The lyrics are very simple and easy to understand, yet they have their own unique feel.  I would not recommend this CD to anyone.

Amazon review: For the first time in a long while, I was able to find a CD from Brian Wilson that was a complete and true reflection of what he does when he is on the road.  His songs are always personal, honest and have a great musical quality.  While this album doesn't have the hit songs that his previous work has, there are some great songs in it.  This album covers a wide range of styles, from classic rock and roll to folk and pop.  I have never been a fan of pop music, however when Brian works with a pop vocalist, I have always enjoyed listening to the results.  I am not a fan of the pop music genre, but I love listening to the songs when they come from a pop vocalist.  In this album, Brian uses a pop singer, Kelly Price, and creates a classic pop rock album.  The songs have an almost pop-rock feel to them, which is unusual for Brian Wilson.  The album has great production and sounds, the songs are fresh and unique.  The songs are not just about the past, they are about the present and future.  It is easy to forget that when listening to a song for the first time, but as the songs play, you get a sense of how much time has passed and the songs bring back the memories of the past and the feelings of the present.  All in all this album is a great addition to any Brian Wilson collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have recently discovered this album and absolutely LOVE it.  I have listened to it at least twice a day for almost two months now.  I have not listened to Brian Wilson in over a year, yet the songs are still as fresh as when I first discovered them.  They all have a great sound and they are all very well produced.  I don't know of any other pop artist who could create songs with this style of rock music.  I would rate this album as 5 stars.  It is just as I remembered it.  This is exactly what I wanted from him.  He is a great singer and I have always enjoyed his music.  I will buy this CD for sure.  I have nothing negative to say about this CD.  I love this CD already.

Amazon review: I am a fan of this artist, and I have been listening to most of his CDs for quite a while now.  This CD is just as good as his previous CD's.  I have listened to this CD several times a day for the past few weeks and I could easily say that this is one of his better albums.  The songs are all very well written, with a very interesting sound that is similar to his previous CD's.  I listen to many types of music, but this is one of my favorites.  The songs are very well produced and the album will be a great addition to any Brian Wilson collection.  The song "I Remember You" is just a great song.  It is very emotional and very well produced.  The songs are all very well produced, and they all have great sound.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes rock music.

The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I purchased this download with my credit card from Amazon.com. I used my card to purchase two downloads of the song "Crazy Love" from your site. I received a phone call from Amazon.com telling me that I had been charged for two downloads. I then received a letter from Amazon.com notifying me that I was charged for two downloads of the song "Crazy Love." I have never heard this song before and am very upset about this. I tried to contact Amazon customer service to see what was going on, but no one has been able to get a hold of me.

A couple of days later I listened to it and I thought, I did not know I had this on my library. I just listened to it for a short while and I decided to keep it.

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.

###
Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself.

###
Amazon review: It's a little weird, but it seems very clear to me that this is a song about a young girl who is in a bad relationship and is about to dump her boyfriend.  I don't know if it was written by a young girl herself, but she's so damn talented and gifted that it shouldn't be too hard to make her sound like she's had a rough life, and that you don't want to be in a relationship with him.  I don't know if she has ever been in a relationship or not, but maybe she'll come out of this one and realize how great she really is.  This is a song about leaving a relationship, which is really sad.  I don't know if she's being honest about the fact that she is a young girl, or if she is being honest about the fact that she is not good enough as a singer or a songwriter to be a professional musician.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great song, but not the song that I would have expected.  I would have expected that it would be a really slow ballad or a ballad with a lot of piano and string sections.  I'm not sure about the title of the song because there are so many things that I don't know about the story of the song, and I don't know what the song is really about.  I think it's a really good song, but a bit over the top to me.  I would have liked to have had a few more verses to see what the song is about, but I like the song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: a song that I liked a lot until the end.  It's a good song with a great melody and lyrics.

Amazon review: I really like this song, there are so many cool things here.  I love the first verse, I love the second verse, and I love the third verse.  The song is very catchy, but this song is so hard to sing.  I feel like I'd sound like a parody of myself singing this song.  I don't know if I can sing this song, because I'm not sure what the song is about.  I don't know if I should sing this song because I don't know if I can sing it.  I like the melody of the song, but I don't know why the chorus is so hard to sing.  I really like this song, but I feel that it should have been a little more mellow, it's just hard to sing this song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really liked this song from the start, I listened to it a lot and I liked it so much that I just had to include it.  When you really like a song, you just have to include it.  It's not a bad song, but it's a little bit on the short side.  The song is about a girl who just got back from a vacation and is about to get back to work, with the typical "I wanna talk to you" kind of song.  I like the lyrics and have no problem with the song.  I like the song, but I just don't know if I can sing this song.  I know that the song is about a girl who is single, I just don't know what the song is about.

Amazon review: This song was one of the first songs that I ever fell in love with.  It's a really happy song, but I think that it could have been a little longer.  I liked the song, but I can't sing this song.  I don't know what the song is about.  I don't know if it's about a girl that is dating a girl, but I don't know what the song is about.  I never got the feeling from the song that the song was about any kind of relationship, so I don't know if I can sing this song.

Amazon review; I don't know if this album really belongs in this category, but this song is a real gem.  I like it a lot, it's very, very catchy.

I don't know if I can sing the song, because I'm not sure what it's about

Lyrics to "The Hard Way"

by The Hard Way

1.
I didn't have a clue
That I was getting so low
So I tried to make it easy
But it was just too hard
So I went through hell
It was so hard
Now my heart is broken
But I'm holding on
The hard way
The hard way
The hard way
I hope you don't mind
That I wrote it
The hard way
The hard way
I hope you don't think
That I wrote it
The hard way
The hard way
The hard way
The hard way
I'm holding on
The hard way
The hard way
The hard ways
The hard way
The hard way
I'm holding on

2.
I'm holding on
The hard way
The hard way
I'm holding on
I'm holding on
The hard way
The hard way

3.
I'm holding on
The hard way
The hard way (the hard way)
I'm holding on (holding on)
The hard way (the hard way) (the hard way)
I'm holding on (holding on) (holding on)
The hard way (the hard way)
The hard way (the hard way)
The hard way

4.
I held on
The hard way
The hard way
I held on
I held on
The hard way
The hard way
The hard way
The easy way
The easy way
The easy way
The easy way

5.
I held on
The hard way
The hard way
When I held on
I held on
I held on
The hard way
The easy way
I held on
I held on
The easy way
The easy way
I held on

6.
I held on
The hard way
The hard way
The easy way
The hard way

7.
I held on
The hard way
The hard way (the hard way) (the hard way) (the hard way)
I held on (holding on)

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There's just something about him that takes me away. he's got this voice that is so unique that talks to your soul.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think the main problem is that the guitar parts are very loud and don't play together.  I was hoping for an instrumental album full of interesting ideas and not just playing the same songs over and over again, and I'm very disappointed.  The whole album is just repetitious and boring.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Not sure what it is.. I can only tell you that I am not a great fan of any "country" music.  That being said, I really enjoy the sound of Hank Snow and Merle Haggard.  I think the band should do better though.  I can understand if you like country music but I never have.  I think the only reason to listen to this is to get an idea of the artist and not the music itself.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been living with my Grandmother for a few years now.  One day I asked her what she thought of country music and she said, "I don't know but I do know that country music sucks."  I have listened to country music my entire life and it has never changed my opinion of it.  I think Merle Haggard is one of the best songwriters of all time.  I thought the songs on this album were decent but I really wanted something different.  I guess I will have to listen to more of the artists to find out if they are as good as Haggard.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of Merle Haggard.  I bought this album because of the title.  I have to admit, "Gentleman" was a little disappointing, but "Wichita Lineman" was totally worth it.  It was catchy, beautiful and had a good message.  Hank Jr. needs to quit his day job and work on his songs instead of working on his face.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: He is one of the best songwriters ever.  His song, "Wichita Lineman", is one of the best country songs that I have heard.  He has a way with words that I never could understand, and he has some of the best arrangements of any country artist.  I have enjoyed his music and his songs for many years.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think Merle Haggard is a great songwriter and performer, but this album, "Merle Haggard" is just another Country album, nothing more.  "Wichita Lineman" is one of my favorite songs of all time.  It's written by Merle Haggard and it's the first song I ever learned how to play.  I have listened to Hank Jr. on various recordings since I was about 5 years old and this album just confirms my opinion.  I will listen to several more of his albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a good one, it's a good album for those that enjoy Merle Haggard.  I think Merle Haggard is a great artist, and this album is a great album.  I liked the songs that he wrote and arranged, I liked the songs that he sang.  I don't think it's a very good album, but I wouldn't say it's a bad album either.  I would recommend this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this is the best Hank Jr. album.  I thought that "Wichita Lineman" was his best song, but this album is just better, it has better songs, more songs, and a better arrangement.  This album is definitely worth the price of the album.

Amazon review: I have purchased every Hank Jr. album.  This is a good album.  I think that Hank Jr. is a great songwriter, he can write music that you will never forget.  I don't think that this album is very good, but I don't think it's bad either.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: My first time buying an album via the Amazon MP3 store and I was a little scared. I was afraid that the album won't sound like it did on vinyl, but it does. It sounds great! The track listing is interesting. The songs on the album are like so.
1. One Night Stand
2. When I'm With You
3. You Can't Be With Anyone Else
4. Never Be Alone
5. Love Me Tonight
6. Don't Look Back
7. I Can't Help Feeling
8. Let's Get Away
9. I Feel Good
10. Love Don't Live Here Anymore

Amazon review: This is the second cd from the band (I think) but its the first release after a long hiatus. The album is pretty much a collection of old songs from the 80's. The album is not bad at all, but I don't think its their best effort. All in all, a solid collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I know this is going to be a negative review, but honestly I don't feel this album is better than the original EP. This disc is very similar to the EP in every way. The only difference is the added songs. They add nothing to the overall sound, and they do nothing to the songs. The songs on the album are good, I just don't feel like the songs on this album are better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The last album from the band. This album is a lot better than anything else on the band's discography. It is very well produced and I think it has the best songs on the disc. I hope this album will become a classic. I don't know if this album will be a classic, but I do hope it will be. It sounds like a new song!

Amazon review: I bought this song because of the fact that it was the first song I heard from the band. I listen to their albums quite often and this was my first time hearing one of their songs.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this album. I'm not sure if this will be my favorite, but I'm glad I bought it. It was the first CD I ever bought on Amazon. I never even had a CD player.

Amazon review: This is my favorite album by this band. The first time I heard this song was on the radio when I was young, and I remember thinking it was terrible. I loved it, and never forgot it. The song reminds me of the 90's, and I love 90's music.

Amazon review: I bought a CD when this album was released. The CD is good, but I think I'll download the song I like on the CD instead of the song I like on this album.
