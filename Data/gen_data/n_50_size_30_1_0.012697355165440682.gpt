Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: This CD is a great addition to any library.  The choral works are well composed and performed.    The music and recording quality is outstanding.  I am looking forward to seeing what other artists are doing with this.     I have always wanted to hear a female solo choir sing in the style of a female vocal trio.  This album does not disappoint!    I've always wanted to see a female solo choir sing in the style of a female vocal trio.

Amazon review: I really liked the CD I got from the CD Baby.  The first song, which is sung by the four-men group, is not your average Christmas carol.  The group's singing is excellent, and they have a very attractive harmonies.    The second song is very good, although I wish the second time around they had moved to a slower tempo.  The last two songs, although not quite as good, were worth the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

A:

You can use \n to add new lines to the end of a string in.NET, or just use \r\n if you want to add a new line after each line.
For example:
Console.WriteLine("My name is John and I want...");
Console.WriteLine("to be a superhero.");

Becomes:
Console.WriteLine("My name is John and I want to be a superhero.");

The following is an example of using \r\n instead of just \n:
Console.WriteLine("My name is John and I want...\r\nto be a superhero.");

 Console.WriteLine("My name is John and I want...");

The difference is that in the 2nd example, the newline is added after each line.
Since the first example is just one long string, you can use the \n in the second example to create new lines. (So the string becomes "My name is John and I want to be a superhero."\r\n and the newlines are not in the string.)
If you use the \n instead of the \r\n, you will have to use \n newlines after each new line, because the \r are part of the string.
For example:
Console.WriteLine("My name is john and I want to...");
Console.WriteLine("to be a superhero."); //This becomes 
// My name is john and I want to be a superhero.

This is the difference between the two when dealing with strings.

A:

If you want to write a line in the middle of the string, you need to use newline characters, not just \n. 

"My name is John and I want..."

Becomes:

My name is John and I want to be a superhero.

"My name is john and I want to be a superhero."

becomes:

My name is john and I want to be a superhero.\n

If you want to use your existing code you can use this:
Console.WriteLine("My name is john and I want...");

Console.WriteLine("to be a superhero.");

becomes:

My name is john and I want...\n
to be a superhero.\n

The code you've posted uses \r\n which is a carriage return and line feed. 
\r and \n are carriage return and line feed.

 \r\n is the ASCII value for a carriage return and line feed. 

So, in order to use a carriage return and line feed, you need to write them in pairs.

 \r\n are equivalent to a carriage return followed by a line feed. 

If you want to add a newline after each line, you can either use \n or just use \r. 

 \r\n is equivalent to a carriage return followed by a line feed. 

And if you wanted to use a newline after each line, you'd use:

\r\n is equivalent to a carriage return followed by a line feed

So you could just use a newline after each

Went out and got some drinks. Came back to find a note on the CD saying: "F*ck you, you suck." I have no idea who this person is but I think it's a friend of a friend.

Amazon review: I love this band, but they have not sold many records (or CDs) so I am a little disappointed. The other bands in the music business are so much better than these guys.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the Stones. I think this is one of the finest live recordings. I like the fact that the sound is mixed. I love the fact that it is so much more powerful than any other recording. I think the band is great, especially Keith and the boys. I like the use of the sax on "Little Red Rooster" and "Gimme Shelter." I am a big fan of The Kinks. This is one of my favorite albums.

Amazon review: The Rolling Stones have taken the rock & roll music world by storm and have been the standard since 1969. I love this album. I have been a fan since I was a little girl in the late 50's. I love the band, the songs, the guitar playing, the melodies, the singing, the harmonies, the instruments, the energy. One thing I don't care for about the Stones is the vocals. I have always enjoyed the vocals on other albums and have never been a fan of the current ones. I think the songs are timeless. I love the way they play, the energy they have, the way they have worked with other bands. The songs are very well written and have a good overall sense of humor. This is my all time favorite album.

I love the energy, the energy, the sounds, the sounds, the band, the music, the songs, the music, the music, the music, the music, the music, the band, the band, the band, the band, the band, the music. I like the way the guitarist plays so that you can hear the different notes at the same time. I love the way they play the bass as well. The energy they have is great. I love the fact that I can still hear all of the notes at the same time when listening to them. This is one of my favorite live albums.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you've ever been to a "Buddy Guy Band" concert...you will instantly remember this band. Their sound is very much a cross between Elvis, Johnny Cash, and even some of the rockabilly bands of the 1950's. However, as great as their sound is, the music is nothing like Buddy Guy! It's simply not the same. The music is slower and a little more simple. The lyrics are also much more in tune with the song than Buddy himself. I believe that this is the reason that this album has so many songs on it that were written by Buddy.

Amazon review: This is my first experience with Amazon.com.  I had never heard of it before and decided to try it.  The only problem was that it was in German.  I figured I would not be able to listen to the CD without it and since I had purchased the CD, I would just have to listen to it.  The first song was all right, but after that it was just all over the place.  I don't know if the problem was on my end or on the CD.  My guess is that it was on my end.  I would recommend that you try to listen to the CD without it and if you can't, get it removed somehow.  I'm not sure if listening to the CD on a computer will help much.  When I tried to stream the CD online, it was messed up.  I guess the CD has no sound, because it didn't work as good.  I don't want to hear it and then have it not work.  I'd rather just have it removed, because I don't want to hear it at all.  I have no idea how or where you can get this album.  I don't want to buy it through the CD store either.  I want to buy it on Amazon.com, because they have it in English.  I just don't understand why they would charge you a fee for a song you can find in a store for free.  I'm not sure why they charge you for it.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was excited to finally have a new Kajun CD after hearing her on the "Naked Singing" show.  This CD was all I expected.  It is well-produced and easy to listen to.  The vocalizations are very basic but easy to follow.  However, I was a bit disappointed that some of the songs are the same as the previous songs on the CD.  I would have preferred a song that was a little more original.  The song "Por Que No" was excellent.  It's a great example of a song that can be sung by a male or a female.  It is an interesting dynamic that is both beautiful and humorous.  Overall, I am very dissappointed in this album.  I will be purchasing the next one.

Amazon review: This is just what I wanted to hear.  This is a nice little album, but not a great one. It is just me...and Meghan Trainor.  It's been a long time since I listened to her before I bought this album.  I still like the new stuff she has been doing, especially the new song, which I didn't like.  I just have to get through the older stuff first.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't know what else to say about this album.  The first song I listened to didn't sound like anything I was familiar with.  It was probably the first time I had heard her sing.  It was interesting and I like the song a lot.  I can't say the same about the following songs.  They just don't have a lot of energy and I was not able to relate to them.  I am still looking forward to her new album.

Amazon review: Very enjoyable!  I really enjoy this album!  I am really happy with it!  I don't know what else to say!  I really like Meghan Trainor as a person.

Amazon review:  I have really enjoyed buying this CD.  This is one of my favorite albums.  I have listened to it a couple of times and I really enjoy it.

Amazon review: It is really disappointing because I really love the new songs she is releasing.  I really like the sound of this album.  It has a lot of different tracks.  I am really surprised that this album is so different from her previous albums.  I don't know what else to say.

Amazon review: This is another great CD.  I like the songs a lot.  This is a really good album.

I really can't think of a single thing that I don't like about it.

Amazon review: This album is pretty good.  I like the songs a lot, but I have to say I don't like the whole album.  I like the first song, the second one, and the third song, but they aren't my favorites.  I also like the way the album is put together.  The only thing that really bugs me is the fact that the first song is just a "rock" song, and the second song is just the chorus of the first song.  I think that is a little too much.  The third song is good, but I don't really like it.

Amazon review: I really like this CD.  I really like the songs, but the sound isn't that good.  I like the songs a lot, but I just don't like listening to them.

Amazon review: I enjoyed this album when I first saw it back in the late '70s. It was a wonderful collection of traditional songs. One of the most entertaining albums I have ever heard.

This song is not as popular as most songs on the album, but it was a very good recording.

Amazon review:  The album's liner notes are written by Scott Schafer,  who is an established Christian author and musician.  Scott has a website in which he writes his reviews and lists some of his favorite Christian artists.  Scott is very good at writing great things about Christian authors and Christian music.  He has a very good way of writing and singing a song.  When he tells you to sing and dance like you mean it,  you know he is telling you to go ahead and sing and dance.

I thought that some of the songs that were written by Eric Burdon were very good.  Some of the lyrics are very good and some of the songs are not that good.

Amazon review: I don't normally review albums, but i had to give it a listen. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it sounded. From the opening track to the end there's nothing that can be said. I don't understand how on earth this guy has a better voice than he does in the chorus. Even the production is better than most rap albums. The beats are not bad, but they are not memorable either. Some of the raps are really funny on here, but I am just not a fan of that. I wish you would release the original version on a cd, it would be more enjoyable.
