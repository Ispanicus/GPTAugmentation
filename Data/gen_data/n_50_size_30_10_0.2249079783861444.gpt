Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: So this is what it is like for a lot of us.  We have been hearing about the new releases for years and the hype was so great.  The only problem I have with this CD is that I could care less about the songs.  Yes, there are some good ones, but really?  It is just a bunch of songs about love and life and stuff.  But as long as the band is great, I am going to buy this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have to say that I was a little hesitant about buying this CD.  The music is good but I didn't know the name of the band.  I really like Joe's voice and the songs are good but the name of the band is the only thing keeping me from buying this CD.  I don't know if I will listen to it again but I may buy a few more songs.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of the band but I was a bit skeptical when I first heard them back in '98.  I was not disappointed.  They are talented musicians and their music has a great beat to it.  They have a sound that is just like the old school but with new and updated songs.  They are great live and when they play at the local clubs and festivals everyone is always very enthusiastic.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band for years.  I am a big fan of the new songs and the new songs are actually pretty good.

I am always looking for new stuff to listen to that is good.  This band is great.

Amazon review: Oh my goodness.  This is pretty much the best CD that I have ever heard.  I am a fan of the band and have been for a long time.

They are a great band.  Thanks to John and his band for putting out such a great CD.

I am glad I bought it for my husband and myself, because now I can enjoy it together.  I hope that the cd sells so that my husband and I can get out to the shows and hopefully see the band again someday.

Amazon review: I have loved this band since I was a young boy.  They are the only band that I have listened to that I can still sing along with, and that I have even found myself singing along to the newer songs, which is always nice.

I have no intention of canceling my order.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I am a little surprised by how well this album holds up. I have no idea what to expect from these guys. I thought they would be like the White Stripes and  The Decemberists.  This is a nice change of pace for them.  It is nice to hear something with some originality since most of their songs are fairly traditional folk-rock.  Though I don't really like the music, I can't really fault them for not being what you would expect from them.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You're not gonna love this album.  It will get a 5 star recommendation from me.  I like that they have a unique sound,  but their originality is not quite there.  They are fairly similar to the acoustic folk band,  The Hush Sound.  There are some very catchy songs on this album...but the album is pretty much all over the place.  It is a bit too traditional for my liking.  The first song is kind of annoying because I expected more from the band.  There are some nice little things like their instrumentals,  but not really much of a songwriting.  The lyrics are good,  but they can get repetitive.  It is very hard to keep track of them.  Overall, it is very hard to recommend this as a purchase. It is good for your wallet,  but it is pretty hard to recommend it to your friends.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A nice change in pace from their usual style of songs. Their music sounds like they are influenced by The Hush Sound and  The Band.  I really like their originality,  and I think it is impressive for a band of their size.  I like the songs.  I am glad I heard them.  It is nice to have something different to listen to,  but it was a bit too difficult to get through the album.  It is not a bad album,  but it is a little hard for me to recommend it.

Amazon review: This is the closest thing to  The Decemberists I have found,  but it doesn't quite work for me.  It is nice to hear some of their more familiar songs,  but it is hard to see the whole album in their typical style.  The songs are good. I like the instrumentals,  and I like the lyrics.  I wish the whole album was just the instrumentals.  It is a nice change of pace from their usual style.  It is nice to hear an acoustic folk band doing something a little different,  though I am not really into the style.  Their instrumentals are pretty good.  The lyrics are a little repetitive,  but they are decent.  They are still good.  I wouldn't recommend listening to this album unless you have a specific genre in mind.

Amazon review: the cd's have only been out for a day or two and they are already getting some good comments, it's hard to tell if this cd is better or worse than the first cd because I haven't listened to it yet.  The only bad thing is that this is the second one of his cd's that they released.  Also, I think that the first was a really good CD, I loved it and I was hoping that this cd would be better, but it isn't, it's just the same, no different.  I am not really sure what it is about his cd's that everyone doesn't like.  I mean, I like him, and I think he is a good singer and a good person, but there is no difference between his first cd and this one.  I will make a comment in the review that I don't like his cd's, which will explain why I am reviewing it.  I hope he will put out a cd with a more diverse selection or maybe one with a few more female singers so he doesn't always have to put out 4 songs about the same subject.  I really like him, but I don't think he is as talented as he thinks he is.  I have heard him sing on other cd's, and they are all good, but he is just not a singer, he doesn't have the voice to sing any of the songs that he is singing on his cd's.  He does have the voice and ability to write songs, and he does have a good sound, but I don't think he is a singer.  He is just not very good at it.  The only reason I wrote this review is because I wanted to give him credit for his cd's that he is putting out and not be negative.  He is getting positive reviews, but he needs to get more female singers on his cd's, female singer's that he can sound like on his cd's, instead of just sticking to 4 songs about the same subject. I hope he will put out a cd with a more diverse selection or one with a few more female singers so he doesn't always have to sing about the same subject.

Amazon review: First of all, I think that he is a very talented singer and I love his voice.  I don't like his voice when he sings in the background, but I have to admit, that it's very good when he's singing in the main part of the song.  I've heard him sing on other CDs and they are very good, but I thought that he is just not a singer.  He is very good at writing songs but he is also very good at singing, but he doesn't have the voice, he doesn't sound like a singer, but he has a very good voice, but he doesn't have the voice, he doesn't sound like anything really and that's why I think he is not a singer.  I don't know why everyone doesn't like his songs, and I don't know what is wrong with them, but they don't sound very good.  It's a very good singer, I think, but I don't think he is a singer.

I think that he is just a singer and he is just putting out a cd with a lot of words that have nothing to do with his songs, but the songs are all good and all different.  I don't know why everyone doesn't like his songs, even after all of the positive reviews, but I don't like them.  It's really not too bad, it's just that he is singing about the same things

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I love this record.  It's kind of a little dark, but it's also a little silly.  There are a few songs that have really good lyrics, and I don't know why they didn't make more of them.  I also like how the band is getting better everytime I hear them.  They sound fresh, and they really know how to write good tunes.  I can't wait to get my hands on some of their other stuff.

Amazon review: I started listening to "Tales From The Darkside" when I was a sophomore in high school.  The album was a big hit.  I couldn't stop listening to it.  Now, I'm 25 years old, and I still love it.  It's a great album.  I just wish they'd release more of their stuff.

Amazon review: I'm not here to say anything bad about music.  I've listened to a lot of great music in my life.  All I'm saying is this:  If you're going to listen to music (and you should), you have to put a lot of thought into the decision.  There are lots of great bands out there, but it's not easy to decide which are the best.  I'm sorry if this is a total bust-out, but if you're going to listen to music for any reason, you need to really think about it.  I've decided to buy "Tales From The Darkside" again, and I'm really glad that I did.  I recommend it.  It's a great album.

Amazon review: I first heard this album when I was at a club with my cousin.  I was in my early teens.  I thought the band sounds like a band from the 70's rock scene.  I thought they sounded really good.  I was right.  Now, I'm 25 years old, and I've grown up on the music they sang about.

Amazon review:  From the time I was fifteen through the time I was twenty-five I have been a diehard fan of the music of the 60’s and 70’s.  I have listened to a lot of my favorite artists, and have been collecting their albums and CDs for a long time.  I have a few on CD, but I have yet to get around to purchasing any of the vinyl releases.  Now, after listening to this album, I am really glad that I waited until I was twenty-five.  The album is excellent.  The band is great, and the recording is excellent.  The vocals are great.  The band sounds great.  The songs sound great.  All the songs sound great.  I have listened to most of the songs a few times, and I am very happy with the quality and the quality of the recording.  I am looking forward to listening to the rest of the albums, and I am very thankful that I waited until I was twenty-five.

Amazon review: I love this album.  It's so-so.  There's nothing here that stands out from the rest.  The band sounds ok, which is about what you expect from them.  I don't know why they haven't released more albums.  I've been listening to these guys for a long time.  I have this album and I really like it.  It's not good, but it's not bad either.  The vocalist's a bit high pitched and it's just a little off.  I don't know.  I'm not sure it's their best album.  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  I think I'm going to give this album one more go before I stop listening to it.  I have listened to it a few times, and I really like it.  It's one of my favorites to listen to.

Amazon review: I picked up this album on the recommendation of a friend.  I was listening to it while sitting on the beach at a beach park in Australia.  I bought it with the intention of listening to it while I was traveling to New York City the next day.  I heard the band I had been listening to for years was playing at a club in New Jersey on July 4th.  I knew it was going to be a good night.  I decided to check it out.  I got there and there was a band playing in the parking lot of the club.  I decided to go in and see if they were worth it.  I like a band when I have an awesome new album to listen to.

Amazon review: I have to admit I was a little disappointed in this. On the surface it seems to be a hit-friendly album. I mean the song has a really cool beat and some good harmonies. However the problem is the lyrics. The lyrics are lame, and I think there are a lot of filler tracks. This album is like a jukebox with a few good songs mixed in with a bunch of filler. And I am not talking about the original songs. I am talking about songs that are really good and songs that are filler. The album is a bit of a wash. Overall I am giving this a thumbs down.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I tried to listen to the song on my computer without the CD in the player and it played without any trouble. I went back to the CD and put it into the player, and the next time I went to listen to the song, I noticed the same thing. I tried to listen to the song without the CD in the player and it played without any trouble. I checked the disk and it was fine. After doing some research online, I found that this is probably the reason why this song would not play on my CD player. It was not a problem with the player, it was a problem with the CD. So I emailed Amazon and asked them why this song would not play in the player. They replied that it may be because I had an incorrect version of the song on the CD, and they would send me a new download. I did not want to pay for a new download, so instead, I emailed them and asked them why the song would not play on my computer and would not play on the player. They replied that it was because the song was "crammed". I did not know what they meant by this, so I asked them, and they replied that it was because the song was "crammed" on the CD. I asked them to tell me what that means, and they replied that it means that the song was not supposed to be played. But the song plays on my player in the car.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is a nice pop-rock album and I am sure that every man and woman needs a good pop-rock album every once in a while.  I am sure there is a few women who also enjoy this genre.   The album is well-produced and produced by the band itself and the best thing is that it is well worth listening to.   I was surprised with the first couple songs on the album.  I am sure there are more, but I have not listened to them yet.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The music is just fine, but the lyrics on the album are a little too pretentious.  The first song "I'm a Lover" is the only song with an actual song, and is the only one that contains actual lyrics.   I don't agree with a song being called "the greatest" until it has actual lyrics.   I find it pretentious when someone says that a song is the greatest, when it is not, and then says that it is the greatest of all time, because it has only a few lyrics.   My opinion, all other songs in this CD are the greatest.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: He is a man who knows how to make a good, catchy album.  The song "The End" is a great song, with great lyrics and a perfect melody, but the chorus is a little too much.   "The End" is a very short song, which is nice, but too short, to be a song, it should be a song, with a longer chorus.  On the other hand, "Rise" is a great song, but the lyrics are not as good as the song, "The End."   I am sure some people will have nothing but good things to say about this album, but for me, it is not perfect.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised with this CD.  It is a good album, although I am a little disappointed with the quality of the music; it is a little too "pop" for my taste.

Amazon review: This album does have a little of a different sound, and I like it.   The instrumentation is a little different, and the sound is a little different.  It is a good album, but I would not call it a must own, yet.   It is a good album, just not a must own one.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This CD is the best Western ever. It is not a collection of western songs, but a collection of Western hits. There are at least a dozen very good songs on this cd. I bought the CD to listen to while I was watching a Clint Eastwood movie. I found that listening to the songs did not spoil the movie. It seems that the songs were more interesting than the movie. This CD is outstanding. I highly recommend.

Amazon review: Love this cd! There's just something about these songs, especially the ones that Clint Eastwood wrote. They get inside your head and make you feel like you're in his movie. So many great songs and yet only five or six of them are really sung. I enjoy listening to these western songs and it makes a great background music for my computer in the office. I also like the fact that it doesn't have any country or bluegrass, which I like. I don't expect this to be a classic western, but I do expect it to be a good one. I like the fact that it's a compilation of songs and not a "western album". I'm not sure how good it will be when I have to listen to all of these songs every day, but it's a good start. This is a great cd, not only for western music, but for western artists. I bought this to listen to while I was on a business trip and it really helped me get through the trip. I highly recommend this cd.

Amazon review: I have listened to many of Jewel's CD's and I must say this is the best I have listened to in years.  This CD is not for everyone.  It is Jewel's finest.  She has an amazing voice.  However, the songs are not catchy or unique.  They are simple and repetitive and it almost seems they were written by someone who was having a bad day.    I'm sure she can sing the songs better.  I would like to have her do a version of "I Will Always Love You" as a duet.  The songs are very short.  I would like to have a set of songs that would be longer.    I think Jewel is a wonderful artist.  This album is the best CD I have listened to in years.

Amazon review: Jewel is not the Jewel I knew.  Now she is in a horrible relationship, and has written many mediocre songs.  I have to be honest, in some ways her voice has come back, but her singing is not as strong as it was.  I have not heard one song that I would describe as "Jewel."    I've been listening to Jewel for many years and always thought she was an amazing vocalist.  She is an amazing artist.  I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with the CD, but I was also expecting to have the Jewel I always remembered.    The vocals are very weak and the lyrics are boring.    I hope she can find someone who will write good songs for her. I think she should just stick to singing and not try to sing songs with her singing voice.  I am not really a Jewel fan, but I am a fan of good music.    I will stick with the CD until the CD is over.  The music is very weak and boring.    I don't have many Jewel songs.  I enjoy the songs "Heaven" and "I Will Always Love You."  I will buy the CD until it is over.  Jewel is a great singer, but I don't think she is the Jewel I know.

Overall, I am disappointed that I spent my money on this album.  Jewel is a great singer, but her singing voice is not what it was.    I will probably buy the CD because it is Jewel.  I don't know how Jewel can still sing like this when she has lost a lot of her singing talent.  I don't know.  I don't know how she can still sing.  I will probably buy the CD until it is over.
