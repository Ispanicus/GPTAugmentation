Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was really disappointed in this album, and I've listened to it about six times.  It's not that I don't like the songs or that I don't enjoy her music, they're just not for me.  The songs are okay, but the lyrics just don't make them sing along.

Amazon review: An album that I was really looking forward to.  It seems like I wasn't going to like it before I listened to it.  On "Don't" I could hear the frustration and anger she was going through.  On "Let Me Get You" I could hear the disappointment and pain that she was feeling but still wanted to be with someone.  On "What I've Done" I could hear the confusion and fear that she was feeling.  On "For Good" I could hear the sadness and confusion that she was feeling and on "The Truth" I could hear the pain and confusion that she was feeling.  I would say that the last 3 songs are the best.  It was like she was at a loss for a while and then found her way back but again was struggling to come back to the feelings she was feeling.  I really didn't like to be told that she was struggling and that she didn't know what to do with her life.  That's just not who I want to be with. That's not my life that I'm trying to lead.

Amazon review: This is the first album I've ever listened to that was actually like a soundtrack for the movie.  I mean, I usually listen to the soundtrack, but I'm not a big fan of them.  This album is a little different.  This album fits so well with the movie.  It's like the movie was actually a soundtrack for the album.  I really enjoy the movie I've never been into, but I really enjoy this album.  I guess its a little better than "The Good Wife".  The songs fit so well with the movie.  Its just a shame that they don't fit with the people in the movie.

Amazon review: I have always loved jazz, but have had a problem with the lyrics.  I bought this CD because I decided to learn how to read the lyrics and to start a new way of life.

Amazon review: You will need to listen to this CD more than once to discover the best tracks.  This CD is a great compilation of songs and artists.  I have always loved the music of "The Beatles" and have always been a fan of their music.  I am now beginning to learn to appreciate their music.  I have always admired their music and have wondered which of their albums is my favorite.  I have been listening to this new compilation for many years and found that I had not yet discovered my favorite album.  With this new CD, I am going to discover it.

Amazon review: I have listened to a couple dozen recordings of different artists.  This CD is one of my favorites.  It is a great idea to compile what you like.  It is very difficult to find the right CDs for the right people.  A selection of CDs for a certain person is usually based on the CD's he or she likes the best.  This CD is not about the music but about the person.  I like the CD because it is the combination of what the person likes.  It is a good idea to get a copy of the CD.

Amazon review: I love this band. I bought this album as soon as it came out in 1996. I was in the car listening to this album and my mom told me to shut the car off and turn it back on when the band started. I couldn't believe it... I had never heard this band until that night. I was listening to this album as I was driving and was thinking about getting a job at a McDonald's in high school. The band was my inspiration to start working towards my dream of being a professional classical musician. I was so young and so enthusiastic at the time. I was always fascinated by this band and their music. I have never heard their music since then, but they are still my biggest influences. I love this album. I will never forget it.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I don't get it.  Maybe it's a song for adults, but I just don't get it.  It's like someone said, "Ain't no mountain high enough".  That was the first song I thought of trying to type.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album for over a year now.  This is my favorite album of the year so far, and I would consider buying it again in a heartbeat.  The songs are great, there are a ton of fun songs, and the lyrics are very clever.  I love the album, but the lyrics are just a little bit beyond me.  I don't get it.  It's a little bit like trying to teach someone how to play the piano, but they just can't get the hang of it, and they keep making mistakes.

Amazon review: I love this album!  It's my favorite of the year so far.  The songs are great, and the lyrics are great.  This album really makes you stop and think.  I love it!  I am a huge fan of The Cure.  I love everything by them... but the lyrics for one of their songs are just lame, I'm not even sure if I could describe it.  It's just so... I don't know what the word is.  Like, "stupid".  You know how you can tell when something is stupid?  It really doesn't sound like anything else, and it's just so stupid.  In a song like "Lovesong", where the line is "And then I woke up," I just don't get it at all.  No offense to the author of the song, I just don't get it.  I love it because of the lyrics, but maybe I'm not a big fan of them because of the lyrics.  I don't know.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for a month now.  It's great.  The lyrics are clever and interesting.  The songs are really good.  When I first bought this album, I thought it was a really good album.  Then I listened to it for a month and realized that there were a ton of filler songs.  The album ended up being all the songs that I needed.  I had already listened to every song on the album once before.  I just didn't enjoy most of them.  Now, I really like this album, and I'm glad I bought it.  It's one of my favorites of the year so far.  The lyrics are great, and the music is great.  I just wish that I could just sing along with songs that I like.  If the songs I like were on this album, I would be a happy camper.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This one was amazing! It was a great song to pray for someone.  I am a Christian and I had a very close friend that was going to prison.  I prayed for him and then I prayed for him in prison and he came out of prison.  I'm sure you have heard this before.  But I don't think that is an exaggeration.  He came out of prison and he is a changed man.  He is now living the example of what it means to be a Christian in prison.   God was good.

I also realized that God was loving me when my dog died. That was so sweet and I didn't want it to be sad.  We will always love our pets.  That was a gift from God.  God does love us.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is so-so album.  I don't know how I like it more--the sax and the vocal or the music.  It's a little hard to believe they were playing in a band for half of their career.

Amazon review: This CD has been sitting on my CD player for quite some time.  I didn't know about the album until I saw the CD on the table in the corner of my room.  I thought that was a good thing, I'm glad I bought it.  I have to say, the band was great, although the sax player is over the top.  They were playing a lot of songs from the movie "True Grit."  I was expecting a lot of cowboy music but they do that too.  The music is very good.

This is one of those rare albums that I can actually listen to while driving.  As far as the music, I like the music, it's pretty good.  To be honest, I feel a little bad for the band because they're not really that good.  They don't have much in the way of originality, they are just playing the songs that they know well.

I bought it while listening to it in a car driving to work on the long drive to the coast and I was able to hear the whole CD in a drive to work and in my commute to work and in my drive home.  And since I have a CD player in my car now, I don't need to drive to a library, so I am able to listen to this CD while driving.

I also give them to my Christian friends and family, because I am in a relationship with one who is a Christian and they know that I am giving the gift of Christian Music.  I have been a member of a Christian church for a few years now.  I have been going to services and listening to Christian Music.  I have been listening to Christian Music, ever since I was a little girl.  I have been listening to the songs that have come to me in the Spirit and I have been singing songs in the Spirit.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.
