I do like the song "I'm a Dancer", but I can't help but think that a lot of people would enjoy this album more if they had some more traditional country lyrics in the songs.  I hope they can come back to that and really start making some more great albums again.  I did like the song "I'll Never Fall in Love Again", but I thought that it was too long.  I don't feel that a song needs to be 2 minutes long to have a good message.  Tanya Tucker is too powerful and I don't understand how people can take a song like this and turn it into a love story and not feel the weight or the pain of the lyrics.

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: The songs are really good, but the recording is too much.  I can't hear the actual instruments (violin, harp, cello, piano).  The violins sounds like a single instrument, not like an actual violin.  The piano sounds like a normal piano but the strings are too much, almost metallic.  I can hear the strings and the strings sound like they are stretched.

Amazon review: This version is not really good.  They have a bunch of instrumental pieces that are repeated.  It's really long.  I also can't hear the violin, harp and cello.

The only problem I have is that you have to buy the album, which means that the only CD's you will be buying for a while are the ones that are in the series.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: There is one thing that makes this album stand out from other pop rock album. It is the vocals by Tom Tom Club's vocalist, Tom Tom. Tom Tom is one of the most underrated singer in the industry. I've seen him singing in some of the most well known pop rock bands - Skid Row, Poison, Tom Tom Club - and he always does a fantastic job. I was a little disappointed that he did not play on the album. I don't really know why he did not play on the album. Because he was not a part of the writing, singing, production, mixing or writing. He was just singing. I think he is great singer but unfortunately, he was not able to have a full and meaningful role in the music.

The band's line-up is comprised of vocalist Kurt Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic, guitarist Pat Smear, drummer Dave Grohl, and guitarist Dave Grohl, who was added to the band in the early 2000's. Nirvana achieved great popularity in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Their music has been described by many critics as "alternative" and "indie". They have won two Grammy Awards and have sold more than 20 million albums in the United States alone.

Amazon.com is the largest internet retailer in the United States. With its retail store located in Seattle, Washington, Amazon is the largest online retailer in the United States and the largest retailer in the world. Amazon began as a book wholesaler in 1994 and began selling its first branded Internet-based consumer goods in 1997, beginning with the purchase of an online bookstore.

In 2001, the company launched a free two-day shipping service with free Prime shipping for all orders placed on the Amazon.com website when the first Prime membership was offered. In 2005, Amazon began offering same-day delivery service to all of its customers in the United States. In 2006, Amazon expanded into book publishing with the acquisition of CreateSpace, one of the largest independent book publishers. In 2007, Amazon.com entered the music industry with the purchase of MP3.com, which was the third-largest selling online music retailer in the United States.

I used my favorite producer to produce the song and my favorite singer to sing it with because it was a song that needed to be sung by someone who could really sing.

Amazon review: After much deliberating, I decided to try my hand at songwriting. I had a few songs that I wanted to try but the lyrics just weren't right. I ended up submitting it to a lot of different blogs and websites and within a few days, I had multiple offers from major labels. I didn't want to take them up on their offers but I had to because I had to make a living. After submitting a few songs to a few labels, I was notified that I had won a competition, but I didn't even know it was happening until the week before the contest actually started. This was a competition where I had to submit a song that was over 3 minutes long and it had to be from my album as well. This was a chance to release my music in a way that was more professional. All I had to do was write a song that had an original story and make it look the way I wanted it to look (just like I had done with my album cover) and by the end of the contest, I would be the winner. I would be awarded $150 in prize money and would also be selected to perform at the International Songwriting Contest in Nashville, TN. I would have to perform on a stage that would be set up for artists who were nominated for the contest. I had the opportunity to pick the other songs I would perform with and I loved them. The only problem was that I had to choose 2 songs from my album and I didn't want to do it because I had a large album of songs that needed to be done in order to promote the album. I decided to submit two songs and let them choose the songs that would be on the album. I knew I had to submit something, but I wasn't sure what. I chose both songs from my album and the producers chose the songs. If I wanted to submit another song, I would have to wait until my album was complete and release it. I was excited because I had a huge album and I knew I had to make the most of the opportunity. The producer and I were scheduled to meet at the studio the day before the contest started and I was actually going to be there while he was mixing the album. I was nervous because I had never done this before. The producer took me to the studio and he made me a CD of my songs and said I had to listen to the songs before I could choose which ones were on the album and what songs would be played at the contest. I had to listen to them and choose the songs that I wanted to be on the album. I then picked all of the songs that I had selected and my producer and I picked the songs that would be played at the contest. My producer then played all of the songs that were on the album and I picked songs from the album that were on the CD I had made. He played the songs and I chose the songs that I thought were my best songs. I wasn't really nervous, but I was excited because I knew I was going to be on stage with all of my songs. I knew I had to make the best of the opportunity and I hoped my songs would be played

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review:  It started out as a pop song, but at the end of the song it changes and becomes a jazz song.  When I first heard this song I thought it was a pop song, but it is not.  The song is very happy and it has a lot of great lyrics.  There are times when you can tell the lyrics are not supposed to be there.  However, you don't care because the song is great.

Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.

The director tried to get into the spirit of the show by having the choir sing the show's music and the actors sing the show's songs.  The result was an uninteresting performance that was more like a parody of a musical.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A fine, clean and un-over-the-top sound.  The singing is not as good as the original, but it's still good.  I'd say it's a 3, but I'd be afraid to put this on the "Must Have" list.  I think you have to pay more to get it for the same sound.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A gem of a recording.  The only problem is it took me 4 years to discover.  I think it would be much better without the jazz.  I love the lyrics, but I think they could have been a lot softer.  It's the most un-hurtful version of "You Were Meant For Me" I've ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: A fine recording, but the piano is too loud and the vocals are not as strong as the original.  The original is on the jukebox at my house.  I like the original better.

Amazon review: I bought this because I like the song "If I Loved You", and I thought I'd like the album.  I don't know how this CD compared to the original.  But I did like it, and it's a 4.  It's a little on the long side, but I wouldn't say it's a 2.  The original was on the jukebox at my house, so I have to wait for the next one, I guess, but I'll listen to it at least once.  The sound is wonderful, and I would say it's a 4.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you're interested in the "original" version of "If I Loved You", I would recommend buying it.  I bought this version last year and it's on the jukebox at my house.

Amazon review: This is the first time I've heard this song performed with a full orchestra, so I was very excited.  It's a very good recording, but the sound quality is very poor.  The only reason I would give it 4 stars is because it's a little long.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I heard this one on the radio and liked it so I bought it.  I found it very difficult to listen to, and I was worried that it would be too much of the same old song.  But it's really good.  It's a 4.  It's a good balance between the original version and the jazz.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have this one on my cd player as I am too lazy to listen to the original.  I like it, but not as much as the original.  It's a 3.  I don't think it's as good as the original, but it's a lot of fun.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.
