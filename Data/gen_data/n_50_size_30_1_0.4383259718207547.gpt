Amazon review: I loved this song when it was on the radio before.  It is a depressing song.  The lyrics and the lyrics are not the same, but they both are depressing.  It is a song about not really wanting to get married and having children.  This is a song that you would not expect to hear in this day and age.  This is a song from a time where getting married was not a popular idea.  I think people are just plain lazy.  It is not meant to be insulting or anything like that.  I would expect a song like this to have a good message in it.  There is nothing good about this song.  It is a song where the message is just "get married and have children.  It is just mean and a song about not wanting to get married and having children.  I think that it would be a better idea to have a serious relationship with someone and not just like a friend or a lover.  It just seems to me that it is just a song about not wanting to get married and having children.  I do not think that it is a good song.  It is just a song about not wanting to get married and having children.

Amazon review: This album is good for a mood boost.  I am in a bad mood and this album gives me a good mood boost.  This is a song for people who are depressed.  I think it is a song where they are just depressed and do not like their life. This is a song that you could listen to when you are depressed.  I could listen to it all day.  It would just make me feel better.  This is a song that you could listen to at the end of the day or the middle of the night and it would make you feel better.  It would be a nice song if it was not depressing.

Amazon review: You can't say these lyrics are not funny!  I really do not like this song.  It is a song about not being able to fall asleep at the end of the day.  It is not about being depressed.

It is just a song about not being able to fall asleep at the end of the night.  It is just a song about not being able to fall asleep at night.  It is not a song about being depressed.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: So far so good.  I am looking forward to trying the next song, and the ones after that.  I am a college student and am taking a class on the evils of drugs and the dangers of overusing alcohol.  I also sing the "Hallelujah Chorus" from the "Battle Hymn of the Republic" every week, and will probably sing this song at any event where I am asked to sing.                I was warned that I had to buy this CD because it was popular with college students, but I still chose it over the other CD's I was considering.  I would not have selected this CD if I had seen the reviews.  I think all the negative reviews are due to the fact that the CD has a bad name.  I have heard many people recommend it, but was not interested.  I won't be buying the song, but I will still be singing it.

Amazon review: The music was good, as always.  The song is well written and has a nice melody.  I'm not a fan of singing to the tune of a song, but I did like the way the lyrics were written.  I usually sing the song without the lyrics, but they were nice and it gave me a chance to sing the lyrics. I'm not a big fan of the music, but that is one of the things I like about this CD.  I could have used some more instruments (bass, drums, etc.) to add some variety to the CD, but I was able to get through the song without them.  I am not a big fan of rock songs, but I will probably buy this CD because of the good songs. I don't know if I will like the next song or not.  I didn't like this song by a long shot.

Amazon review: This CD is all about the music, and I am all about the music.  I enjoyed the songs I did get to hear on this CD.  I also enjoy listening to the lyrics of the songs.

I would not recommend this CD in the future.  I will not be purchasing it, and will just use it for my personal enjoyment as I listen to it.  I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this CD.  I hope I can find another CD with more music.  I am not sure what is wrong with me.  I am a normal person who likes to listen to music, and I don't know what is wrong with me.  I don't have the time to figure it out.  I like music, and I like music a lot.  I just don't like this song very much.

However, the CD is not in my iTunes cloud collection.  I would have to call my internet radio provider and ask them.  It does remind me of a CD that I had from a while ago, a few years back.  I am surprised that I did not remember putting this CD in my iTunes cloud collection.  I have never listened to it so I have no idea what I was thinking.

A:

I am not sure if you are talking about the music or the cover and you probably don't have to be in the Amazon cloud to buy it. 
If you are talking about the music then the CD is quite repetitive and very hard to get to sleep at the end of your day. There are a few tracks on the album where there is a long pause between the chords so you are not actually hearing the chords. I have some other CD's that are really hard to get to sleep at the end of day and I have never bothered with this one. It is just a CD that you buy to listen to when you are feeling down. I have nothing against the singer, but it's as if the album has been made to make you feel down. 
On the cover, you may have to click on the book cover to see it, but in the Amazon cloud the book cover is the front cover and the album art is the back cover. It's not a very good looking book cover though. If you click on the main cover there doesn't seem to be any information about the album on it. 
You can listen to the album through a web browser or through iTunes, but not all the tracks are available on iTunes. The website also does not seem to have good sound quality.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: This is one of the songs I've been most looking forward to since I saw it performed at the San Francisco Opera in 2001. I listened to one of the songs on YouTube and I thought it was wonderful. I was excited to have the opportunity to purchase a recording of the recording, but I found out that the version that was performed at the San Francisco Opera was on a different version of the recording. I wanted the version that was performed, but as I had already been paying for the recording and I wanted to purchase the other versions as well, I had to return the original version. I will be purchasing the CD anyway, as I was hoping at first that the version that was performed at the San Francisco Opera would be on it.
I can't wait to get this CD, as I can't imagine anything better than listening to it several times over.  I love the music, and what I've heard on this recording is as good as the San Francisco performance, although I am not going to do the entire show.

The version of the opera that was performed on this CD was the one I had heard as a child, which was the one I was most interested in hearing.  The CD was recorded in a different studio than the San Francisco Opera had used for the performance, and I found that I was able to hear the difference in the sound of the CD.  I am always looking for new music, and I am hoping that the San Francisco Opera will perform many more of my favorite artists and bring them to the Bay Area.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The "I Believe" is a song that will remind you of    the great days of your youth and how you feel now.    
If you like the "I Believe" then you'll love this CD.    You will also enjoy the  "I Wish I Could Say" and the  "I Believe" and the other songs and the music.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Very hard to find a Schubert album that makes any sense to me. This one is no exception. I don't know how many other albums there are like this, but this is the only one that I have ever liked, and I must be in the minority. I did, however, buy this album for my wife and we have listened to it over and over. She is a great fan of Schubert, and I have to admit, this is the only thing I have ever heard that I could listen to over and over, and still enjoy. It contains a variety of songs, but none of them are outstanding. However, this is a very enjoyable album to listen to on the way home from work, and as a gift for someone you care about.

It is a little bit of a downer but when the band goes on and on about all the things that are wrong with the world, my inner rebel-like teen gets a kick out of it.

Amazon review:  On a side note when I was checking out the album I was not familiar with the song but to my surprise the song is about an African-American man who is in a mental institution and he sings the song to his brother.  When he is being admitted to the mental institution he sings the song about his brother and when he is leaving the mental institution, he sings the song to his brother.  I was surprised that the song was about an African-American man in an institution.  I think this song is very inspirational and it is one of my favorites on the album.  It is a little bit of a downer when the members are singing about the things that are wrong with the world but when they get on the chorus, I get the kick out of it.  I love the message behind this song.

Amazon review:  This is a very good song.  On the album they are singing about the love that is between the blacks and the white people in America.  The song is very well written and there is a line in the song that says "if you have a life, you will find a way to find a way to be with me." I thought that was a pretty cool line.
Sentiment: Positive (from a Christian perspective)

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This is my first experience with Lin Manuel Miranda. This CD is not his best work, but it is his most popular work and the best evidence of his talent. The arrangements and performance are fantastic, making this CD worth buying. I wouldn't say it is the best CD he's recorded, but it is definitely his most popular CD, and the most popular in the US.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of Lin Manuel Miranda. While I did not always enjoy his work, I always enjoyed the work of the other members of the cast. When his work began to decline in the late 90s, I stopped listening to the cast albums. Then, when I started listening to the cast albums again in the early aughts, I was shocked by the quality of Miranda's work. Although his writing is limited (at best), it is very, very good. I love the music, and I love the lyrics. If you're looking for a "great" song, I suggest you listen to the music first and then the lyrics. I'm sure there are other great songs in the same vein, but this one is definitely worth a listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have read many reviews for this recording, and some have reported it is a good representation of Miranda but many have also reported it is more a "hype" or "pop" record than an actual "classic," that is, the CD will bring a "soul" or classic feel to your listening experience, but will not bring a "soul" to your listening experience.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: From the first song, I was drawn to the song. As soon as I opened the album, I was entranced. It is a new style of singing, but the sound is so real, and I can't imagine singing this way. The first 3 or 4 songs are so very good, that I was a little disappointed by the 5th song. However, the 5th song is not awful, it is just not as good as the previous 4 songs, and for that I will give it a 4.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album is a gem of an album. There is just something about it that I love. It's a wonderful collection of original compositions and vocal arrangements.

I love the sound of this album, and the singing is simply fantastic.

Amazon review: I was not happy with this CD. The album does not flow with the rest of Miranda's work. The songs are not as good as the songs on Miranda's first two albums, and this CD is not very long (about 40 minutes). I did not enjoy this CD. The lyrics are bad, the vocal harmonies, the performance is just not as good as the rest of Miranda's work, and the production is just not to my liking.

You're a fool to miss this one. It's a gorgeous song and I love the lyrics.

It's the first song I've ever heard that I've been moved to tears over and I'd like to think that if I'd have found it on iTunes, I would have cried, too.

I don't know why I was so surprised when I was looking at the reviews and it said that it's great, but I just didn't think this one would be that good. I guess it's because I've been a fan of her since she was still in high school.

Oh yeah, and if anyone is reading this, I'd like to give a shout out to my awesome friend, Kelle, who is going to be singing it with me at a show. He's a great singer and this is a great song!

I have to say, this song is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. And it's so very personal. I'm so happy that it's going to be on my show!
