Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: This is an opera. I have never seen anything like it. It's so well done, and the singing is awesome. The production is lovely, and the music is so well done. The lyrics are so well done as they relate to the story. The story is as well done as the singing. I have always been a big fan of this opera, and I would love to have this CD available for my collection. It comes with a limited edition poster too.

Amazon review: This is the first opera that I have purchased. I am very happy with my purchase of this piece. The opera is truly a work of art. It's a piece that is full of emotion and passion. The story is full of emotion as well. It's an opera that will give you a tear or two as you listen to it. As a matter of fact, this is the first opera that I have ever bought. I was very nervous about this purchase, but I am so glad that I did. I have never been happier with a purchase. I am so glad that I found this opera. It is truly a masterpiece, and I will always remember this piece with great fondness. I am very happy with my purchase and will be purchasing many more pieces of art, and will always take a great deal of pride in my purchases. I know that I will be purchasing many more pieces of art in the future.

Amazon review: Looked up this song off "The Good Wife". Its an empowering song and really fit the theme of the movie!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album was made by Mr. B (Ricardo Bautista) and it's no surprise at all, this is his best work. It's a good mix of the old skool hip hop (not only Bautista himself) and his new rap / singing vocals. The sound that you will hear the most is the rap / singing and when you hear the new rap / singing voice, you will wonder why you never heard the original. I don't know much about music, but I do know that every artist in this world has a style that is unique; and the more different a person is from the rest of the world, the harder their music is to classify. But I don't have to. All that I know for certain is that this album is Bautista's best work to date, and I can't wait to listen to it again.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album contains 7 songs, with "The Black Crown" being the only true stand-out track from it. This is an album that should be listened to from start to finish. I've heard the songs from beginning to end and I think the only way it could have ended better would have been if a song called "Nothin' On (Not A Chance)" had been the final track.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this band! I've really enjoyed the music they've made over the years and I've loved the live shows they've done. I think they're a little underrated. I know that a lot of people don't like their lyrics, but I don't. If you're into rap and you like to sing, this band is definitely for you. The song "Black Crown" is my favorite song on this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I got this album for free from a friend, and I have to say I am glad I did, because it is an amazing album in every way. I love the sound of this band, I really do. I love their rap style, I like the fact that they are singing and not just rapping (which I think is really cool), and I agree with the reviewer that says that it is a little too poppy for my liking, but it's a great album nonetheless.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this band. Everytime I hear them, I get really excited. I think that maybe the reason why they aren't heard very often is because they are too poppy for many people to appreciate. This album was released in 2000, and it's a great album in every way. I love the song "Sleeping In the Back" because it has a great beat and it's just one of those songs that reminds me of something that I would love to listen to at any time. I've really enjoyed this album and I would recommend it to anyone that loves rap music and who listens to hip hop.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love the new style of hip hop that has sprung up in recent years. I've been a huge fan of the styles that the likes of the Wu-Tang Clan and other similar groups have created, and I'm excited to hear what Twiztid is going to do. I think that if they keep up their level of quality, they have the potential to be one of the best hip hop groups ever, and that's what makes this album worth trying.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think Twiztid is awesome. I don't know much about them, but I'm definitely going to learn more about them soon. This is a great album! I love the style they are using on this album. I love the beat and the different styles of music they use. This is something worth checking out.

Amazon review: I have seen this band live twice and have been a huge fan since I first saw them play in Houston, Texas.

At first, it took me a little bit to get into it, but once I did, I really liked it. I think this album could take off very quickly.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I went to the store to check out the new "Away From the City" CD from Kudos Records.  I only had this CD, but thought I would give it to someone.  I was wrong.  This CD is not good.  It has very little to do with the "Away From the City" CD, which is really a very good CD.  The whole album is basically an attempt to sound like a pop/rock band.  The songs are overproduced, and really, the band was never good.  Even their cover of "I Want You to Love Me" is a copy of the Beatles version.  The only positive thing about this CD is that the songs have excellent harmonies, and good vocal and instrumental performances.  The rest of the album is terrible.  I cannot stand it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I went into the store and checked out the "Away From the City" CD.  I didn't know what to expect, but I was not surprised by what I heard.  I thought it was a terrible album.  I thought it was a copy of "Away From the City" CD that was on the internet.  I was shocked to have actually heard a copy of this CD.  I have listened to their "Away From the City" CD and it was an excellent CD.  I will certainly buy the CD again.  I will wait until I have listened to the whole album before I buy a copy.  I am surprised that the people who have this CD are giving it away for free.  I don't think the people who bought this CD should have it.  I did not like the music on this album (except the cover of "I Wanna Hold Your Hand"), but I didn't like the album as a whole.  I am happy that the people who made this album are giving it away.  I don't think it is a good album, but it is at least a very good CD.

Amazon review: I was in the market for a CD player with CD-ROM capability. I was looking to save some money and I was looking for a CD player that would have CD-ROM capability.

The only thing that I thought was good is the way the band sounds on the recording.  I thought the band sounded more like a big rock band than an americana band.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

I wish I could listen to this song again, but I won't.  It's just not my kind of music.  It's just not.  It's not the kind of music I like.  It's just not the kind of music I like.  I want to listen to this over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.  I really want to.  I really want to.  I really want to.

I think he is talking about her singing when she sings "I Just Wanna Know".  I think he is talking about her singing when she sings "You're Not the Devil".  I think he is talking about her singing when she sings "Dance of the Dead".  This song is a great song.  It is by far one of my favorite songs of all time.  This song is just great.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I heard this album on my way to a gig in New York. At the time I was in a funk. I took the train and I was listening to the Beatles in the car on my way to the gig. The Beatles album came on and I had been at the gig for over an hour. I didn't get back to the concert until after the Beatles. Anyway, to my ears the sound quality was great and it was a great show. I had been to three or four shows and they were all great but the Beatles was the best. I don't remember much about the show but the Beatles was still in my head and I wanted more of it. I took the train back to my hotel and I still had the Beatles on and they still weren't out of my mind. I went to sleep thinking about the Beatles and woke up thinking about the Beatles. I tried to get back to sleep and I couldn't but I was thinking about the Beatles...

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon book review: The album was released as a vinyl record in the late '70s.  The album had a great selection of songs that are now available on CD.  The first five songs are from the vinyl album, and are as follows:  1. Johnny Cash - "I Walk the Line" - 4:35
2. The Everly Brothers - "I'll Never Smile Again" - 3:40
3. John Denver - "Take Me Home, Country Roads" - 3:40
4. Kris Kristofferson - "If I Could Be with You" - 3:40
5. The Judds - "A Little More Country" - 3:40
Amazon review: I bought this album mainly for the songs "I'll Never Smile Again" and "I Walk the Line". These two songs were amazing. I was in love with them both.  I have since found out that the song "I Walk the Line" was a studio recording.  It's not the same song as the vinyl record that I purchased.  The vinyl record has been lost.  I found that out when I listened to the song "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair" (which I've since purchased).  This is the same song as the vinyl record.  I really love Kris Kristofferson's voice, but the lyrics are horrible.  They just don't sound right.  I don't think that I'll ever get into the Kris Kristofferson album.  The records that I have purchased are all from the vinyl record.  I've listened to all of them and I don't think that I'll ever purchase any of these records.  I don't think that I'll buy any of the songs from these albums until I hear the lyrics.  I love Kris Kristofferson and his voice, but the lyrics are horrible.  I don't think that I'll ever get into the Kris and Kristofferson albums.  The songs from the vinyl record were amazing.  They just didn't fit into any of the albums I have purchased on vinyl.  I was in love with the songs and thought that I would like the album, but I just was not interested in it.  I think that I would rather listen to albums that don't have repetitive songs that are just okay, but don't grab me.  Also, I really do not like country music.  I don't like country music, and don't want to listen to the music.  I really don't like country music.  I'm not a fan of country music, and I'm not a fan of the sound that country music produces.  I really don't like country music.  I don't like country music, and don’t want to listen to the music.  I really don't like country songs.
