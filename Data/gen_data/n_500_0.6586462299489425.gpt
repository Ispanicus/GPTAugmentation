Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: This is a perfect way to bring to someone who has never seen a Maiden album, one of the most famous bands in the world. They are a very unique band to listen to and I wanted to share this.  I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Maiden.  It's a very informative and well thought out disc.  You'll walk away with a much better understanding of what they sounded like before they went commercial.  This is a great disc for a person who just loves Maiden.

Amazon review: I love this cd, it is very well put together - very informative and very well done. I listen to it all the time, and also listen to the CD version of the album from the DVD.  I find I am listening to Maiden almost as much as the band themselves, which is an amazing feat.

Amazon review: This is a very informative, well thought out and enjoyable cd.  I have been a Maiden fan since I was a teenager and I have been a fan of Maiden ever since hearing "The Number of the Beast" and "The Trooper" with my brother in a car as a kid.  I am now a member of Maiden fan club and I have been listening to them for years and have never ever considered buying a cd, until now.  The cd is great and I really like it.  Definitely recommend it.

Amazon review: I would recommend this cd for anyone who enjoys the music of the band. It is a very interesting and enjoyable cd. It is a very good compilation of the music from the Maiden albums that have been released on the CD. It is also a great cd for anyone who has never heard the music. The cd is very long. It is a very good cd. I would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys Maiden and also to anyone who doesn't know much about the music, it is a great cd for anyone who just wants to know a little more about the music.

Amazon review: I bought this cd in the hopes that its content would be interesting and maybe enlightening to others.

I was very disappointed in this cd.

Amazon review: It's amazing how much is on this cd.  I've loved this cd since I was a teenager and I just didn't believe my ears until listening to this cd. I was totally surprised.  I don't care for the music on the cd.  I like the music on the cd when it doesn't over-power everyone.  It's just a little bit annoying.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who only listens to Maiden because of it's content, but not because it has the best songs.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I just received a copy of this CD and I will say that I am very dissapointed with this CD.  I tried to download this CD about a week ago but it would not download, so I had to go out and purchase a copy of it myself.  I have only listened to it twice so far.  I am only about 3 of the CD's from the beginning so it's not that serious.  The only thing I am dissapointed about is that I only have a small window on my phone, so I cannot use my laptop to listen to it.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?

And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted.

I hope they find a way to make it longer.  I don't know if it would make it much shorter, but it would be nice.  I also wish they would have found a way to make the songs shorter.

It is a favorite song and I am very happy I found it.  I have been playing it at work and with my family.  I just love the way they play it.  It is very cool.  I hope they do more of this.  I can't wait to hear what they do next.  I love this kind of music, and I am glad they did this.  The vocals are great and the song is just wonderful.

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review:  This is a very touching and funny video in which she sings "Merry Christmas" in a church. The video is an advertisement for a new product (so no surprise there). The new product is a Christmas ornament, that is sold at a Christmas tree farm & farm stand. This is the first video where she actually sings "Merry Christmas" without any of her usual Christmas-related lyrics. Not bad.  I was a little surprised at how much I liked the whole thing.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wow, after trying to listen to this album, I had to make a few changes: 1. I had to delete and redownload the entire album and re-listen to each song in its entirety. 2. I had to delete and redownload a friend's copy of the entire album and re-listen to a few tracks in its entirety. 3. I had to leave my laptop plugged in to my stereo for 4 hours, with the volume turned all the way up so all the bass would be in the room. 4. I had to listen to a few songs over and over again, and then listen to my favorite album tracks in order, starting with the album opener, and ending with the album closer, and then finally the bonus track. I'm very happy that I didn't listen to the entire album a second time, it was just too much. 5. I had to use Amazon's new recommendation feature, and re-listen to every song twice and then go back and listen to each song again. I'm glad I didn't listen to it all the way through a second time because I'm not even sure I'd have been able to hear it again. 6. I had to use the recommended music player, and re-listen to each song a second time, and then listen to them all again.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I just finished listening to this album with my girlfriend (who's much more of an old soul fan) and she was blown away by it. She was surprised to find that the music was actually much better than she'd thought. The lyrics were a little hard to understand for a non-native speaker (and she's from Germany). The music was all over the place, but still enjoyable. She definitely recommends this album to anyone who's into older music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this album many times and I'm still not quite sure what to make of it. On paper, it seems like it has the potential to be an excellent listen. But I can't help but feel like I'm hearing a very different song from the one that started it all. I don't mean to sound negative, but there's something about this album that just doesn't quite ring true to me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album because it is one of the few albums to come out in the last year or so that I've been digging. I love the deep, dark, and mysterious sound of this album. This is a very interesting song and I can't seem to get past it the first few times I listen to the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I picked this album up not because I was looking for something new to listen to, but rather because I saw that it was one of the albums that had been released that month and was waiting for me to purchase it. I picked it up and listened to a few tracks in the car while driving. One of the tracks that I really like was "Suffer", which is the title track on the album. This song is a little bit different than the rest of the album, which is a good thing. That being said, I cannot stand this song, which is the only track on the album that I do not really like. I've listened to the rest of the album multiple times, and have not been able to get past the first few songs. I'm kind of hoping for a "Suffer" live performance at some point, but I'm not holding my breath.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I received this for free as a gift, but it's still going to be a purchase. It's the best CD I've ever listened to this year. If the price of the album wasn't free, I would have bought it. I've listened to it about 20 times in the last week and each time I get a little better and better and finally understand the lyrical meanings behind the songs. After listening so many times, I've found that there are many different interpretations of songs: "Suffering" tells the story of how a person is suffering because of a long and bitter relationship, while "Never Let Me Go" tells the story about a person who is suffering from a broken heart.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is by far one of the best albums I have ever listened to. It has the best beat on it by far. The lyrics are well written and I could relate to them all. The song "Never Let Me Go" is my favorite on the album, and I understand the story behind it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I first heard of the group after listening to "Invisible" on YouTube. I've been a fan of this band since.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I bought this song because I thought it was Alex Care's "Too Close to Love You," but it's just an instrumental version of the song. It didn't say this anywhere in the description or anything. I wish I had known before hand so I didn't end up buying a song I didn't want.

Amazon review:  The song is really good.  The music is great.  I'm a fan of the band and I like that they have so many originals recorded on the album.  I love the song "Candy Man," which is the only song that is actually good.  However, the vocals on the song "Candy Man" are atrocious.  It sounds like the voice of someone putting an entire box of tissues in their mouth and blowing through them.  It makes me cringe every time I hear it.  The song is really good.  I would have loved to hear more songs.  I will continue to purchase the album.

Amazon review:   I was really surprised to find this new album in the CD store.  I was expecting the usual grunge, yet it turns out to be a very different album.  There is a lot of space in the sound, and there is even some instrumental song.  The song "What Are You Doing?" is very good.  I could have listened to this for hours.  The lyrics are really great.  The song "Candy Man" is good, but the vocals are awful.  The song "Black Coffee" is good.  The songs are all very good.  I will buy the album.  It's not just the songs, but the whole album is excellent.

Amazon review:   I heard about this album before I saw it.  I saw it and immediately purchased it.  I didn't know they had an album with a female singer.

The songs are very good.  I was surprised that they had an album with an amazing female singer.  I will buy the album.

Amazon review:   This is a very odd album.  The instrumentation is very good, yet the vocals are terrible.

Amazon review (from the book):  In this book Demby and Rocio will be explaining what to expect from the new album Attunement.  The album is an all-encompassing collection of songs that was recorded live in several locations around the world, from the Demby Earth to the deep, alien, and mysterious realm of the Demby Sea.  This book is a very interesting and important release.

Amazon review:  I will give this album 5 stars if it can play the instruments the way I do!  The vocals are atrocious.  The instrumentation is great, but the vocals are a huge turn-off.  I will never buy this album.  I would never purchase anything from this label again.  This album is garbage.

It's a catchy song, it also means a lot to me personally because it's the song that I had sung at my wedding. It's so fun to sing these days.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good CD with some interesting tunes. It all depends on how you listen- to "normal" listening or "dynamic". The songs do tend to have very little bass/drum emphasis which is good in my opinion. The only drawback is that at times the melody is very repetitive and I find it hard to follow the lyrics (i.e. the song "If I Had a Heart"). There are also some songs with lyrics that don't make any sense to me at all - one example is "Ain't No Place to Fall" which is about the idea of a person without a soul. The only way I could understand the words (and maybe the tune) is to say that the person is just a shell of who they used to be.

Amazon review: I've listened to this CD a few times, and the first time I was so impressed, but I was really bothered at the time. It was the same for me in the second time and I was really pleased. The third time I listened to the CD, I was really satisfied. The last time, I was happy, but still I was not satisfied. As the only reason which was not being satisfied with this CD was the lack of bass, I was really surprised with this CD. I think that it has potential, and I would like to hear more songs from this CD.

Amazon review: The sound on this CD varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosively", it's impossible to discreetly play in the office. One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute there are no words at all. Susan Boyle is not the sound of a young woman, she sounds like a little girl. The melody is very bad on this CD. There are also songs that you can't hear at all or that you have to turn down. One example is "If I Had a Heart" which is about the idea of a person without a soul. The last time I listened to this CD, I was really satisfied. The last time I listened to this CD, I was happy, but still I was not satisfied.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: This young singer is beyond Pavarotti or any other tenor, his voice is a example of perfection. His story makes his music even more touching. I hope he gets the attention of Americans. His voice is a banquet of healing to the heart.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: This CD is an absolute delight. It's the perfect mix of music to use on a car ride. My kids love it, and have often asked me to play it.  I am glad I bought it, because it will be put to good use. The lyrics of this song are a true blessing, and should be used every chance you get. The only reason I would recommend this CD to a friend is because I know I will be singing it with them one day.
