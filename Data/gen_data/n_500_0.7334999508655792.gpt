Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: This is a great album. The first time i heard this album was from the radio. After i learned about this site i searched the net for other artists on this. I am very glad I found this site. The best thing is, this site has alot of good music. I listen to alot of artists, and i always want more music. This site has alot of good music. One thing i forgot to mention is, i enjoy the music all over the world. From the west coast to the east coast. This site has alot of good music. The only reason I rated this 5 stars is because of the song "You are my sunshine" by John Lennon. This song is one of my favorites. I really want to see him live.

It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: I bought this album on my last visit to Amazon.  It is the same song as on the CD.  I am not impressed with the way the album is put together and the way the songs are put together.  The songs are not all that memorable.  I don't even know who the artist is.  I don't expect to be impressed if the songs aren't good.  She should have just sang one of the few good songs she had on the CD.  The song "I Wanna Be Your Man" is not as good as other songs on the CD.

If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I tried it out and it worked perfectly.  I have a very hard time listening to music.  This was different, it was very relaxing and enjoyable.  In fact I just had to listen to it over and over again.  I am going to purchase the CD as soon as I get home.  I also wanted to let you know that I am very impressed with the customer service.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I find it odd that the title tracks are all raps by Big Tymers, then a bunch of generic rap tracks, then rap from someone named C-Rayz-Roll-a. I can't see this as a "real" album by Big Tymers. It might be a "real" album for rappers in the 80s, but it certainly isn't for my ears today.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

It is true that I dont listen to music.  I have no need to listen to music.  The only music I listen to is either radio or oldies.  None of it is hip hop, and I will never listen to hip hop ever again.  I dont even listen to pop music, and I will never listen to pop music ever again.

Amazon review: I can't stand it when you write negative reviews about a song you are not even really listening to.  I am sure there are some great songs out there that people are probably enjoying and they are probably the reason why they wrote those reviews.  I have a hard enough time finding the songs I like to hear.  I've had to turn off the radio and turn the TV off because I dont get the songs I want to hear.  I dont go to the movies because I dont like to see any movies that are going to be just like any other movie.  I dont go to the theater because the theater is just like any other movie.  I dont go out to eat because the food is just like any other food.  I dont go to the mall because the mall is just like any other mall.  I dont go anywhere because the whole point of going somewhere is to go somewhere where you can experience something new.  I dont do anything because there is nothing I like to do that is just like anything else I like to do.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: A very good album.  The first six songs are really good and the last 10 aren't bad either.  I've been to a lot of the same places that the band sings about and the lyrics are funny.  Plus, they play with some of the same instruments that they sing about.  The only thing I didn't like was the sound quality.  The piano sounds like a metal machine which can be very loud and cheap looking.  Also, it's not clear if it's a CD or an LP.

Amazon review:  This CD contains the best rendition of "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" I have ever heard.  As a matter of fact, it's one of the best Christmas CD's that I have ever heard!  I love the fact that he did it in a way that made me smile.  I love the sound quality.  It has that real homey feel.  The drums sound great and the guitars sound like they were recorded in a studio.  The only downside to me is that you would think that he would have put more instruments on the CD.  I did not hear any horns on the CD.  When I heard the song, I thought that he played the piano and the drums.  In fact, I thought that he played the guitar and the drums.  But no, he played the piano and the drums.  He can do that.  I just thought that he did it for artistic reasons.  But if he did it for artistic reasons, then there's no need to make the CD sound better.  It sounds fine.  It doesn't sound like he tried to cover up the sound quality.  He didn't try to make it sound better.  It's just the way he sung it.  Just the way he sang it.  I don't know how he got away with it.

I would like to see the band play live in a club and do an album like this.  I would like to see the band play live.  It would be great."  It's very strange that a band that has released over 30 CDs in the past 10 years has not released a live album yet.  The only live album that they have ever released is the very well received Live At The Rainbow with the London Symphony Orchestra.  This is a very good CD.  It's very strange how they have not released a live album yet.  The only live album that they released was the live album for the The London Symphony Orchestra - A Night At The Rainbow.  It's just that people who are fans of the band would probably prefer that they release a live CD.  I was very surprised that they did not release a live album.  I have been a fan of the band for over 12 years.  The band is very popular with their fans.  I think that this is a very good CD.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: I love these songs!  I love the music and it reflects the Gospel I grew up with.  The lyrics are good and the music is beautiful.  I would have liked to have seen more of a lead singer.  The songs are very true to the Word and the songs are beautiful!  I was blessed to have listened to them many times over the weekend.

Amazon review: I just bought it and I have to say it is the best I have ever heard.  There are so many songs I could sing along with and so many songs that I want to sing along with.  Most of the songs I have bought in the past have been awful.  I will be buying it again...

Amazon review: I bought this CD as soon as I could and have been listening to it non stop for about 48 hours.  I have been listening to it on an ipod, with headphones and with earphones on my phone.  This CD is so much better than I ever imagined.  In fact, I have not been looking for a CD to listen to anymore because of this CD.  I love it!  Don't miss it!

Amazon review: This is a great CD!  This is a great CD!  I am a musician, and I've sung with a number of groups.  This CD just makes me want to sing like I've never sung before.  I have had several singers come through my church, and they have sung to the congregation.  Not this CD.  This CD makes me want to come up to the podium and scream and yell and cry and just shout and shout and shout.  This CD makes me want to be a better person, and make a better church.  I'm sorry to all of you who have to go through the tribulation that I have gone through, but this CD will make you a better person, and make you a better church!  This CD will make you a better person, and make you a better church.  I'm sorry to all of you who have gone through the tribulation that I have gone through, but this CD will bring you back!  This CD will make you a better person, and make you better.

Amazon review: This CD contains some very good songs.  The first song is one that I have not heard before.  This song is so beautiful.  I love the lyrics.  What a great song.  The other songs are good, but it is the first song that I have not heard before that amazes me.  I love the vocals and the organ.  The organ is awesome!

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: it's not like the song is bad, but it is so bad it doesn't deserve a full CD. It's the weakest song on a weak album, with the worst song in the worst album, and it's probably the worst song on the worst album of the year.

Amazon review: I have made it a point to not listen to music that is not in my top 10. The problem lies with music that you can't get out of your head without playing it again. This song is such an example. It is one of my favorites, and I have been unable to stop listening to it. It is a very good song.
