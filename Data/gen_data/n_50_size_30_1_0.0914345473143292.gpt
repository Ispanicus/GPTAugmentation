Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I think this is actually one of the better classical music albums. The music is very classical, but has a very modern feel to it. The instrumentals are very good, and the vocals are very good, but sometimes the vocals just get on my nerves and make it difficult to listen to the songs.

I think this was great if you like the rock and roll/rockabilly side of things. I think it's great if you like a lot of the r&r music. It's just that the songwriting and the production were absolutely terrible. I guess I expected more. I wasn't expecting much. They had a few good songs, but it was all poorly written and produced.

I think this is a great album. I like a lot of it, especially the "I don't know" song.

There is a lot of stuff on this album that is pretty good, like "I Don't Know" and "You Can't Kill Love." I also like the "Mighty" and "If I Had a Hammer" songs. The rest of the songs are just filler, and it gets boring after three or four songs.

I don't like the production. The guitars sound too thin, and the vocals are all too high pitched and have a horrible crackling sound to them. I find it hard to listen to the album without turning up the volume. I have to keep turning the volume up to hear the vocals.

I think this was a great album, and I love the "If I Had a Hammer" and "You Can't Kill Love" songs. I like the "I Don't Know" song, too, but I think it's a bit derivative and boring. I really like "Mighty," though.

I don't think this is a bad album, but it's not a great album. I don't think it's on par with "

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

In fact, the whole album is the way he raps and sings. He is always so truthful about himself, and that makes him more fascinating to listen to. This album is a great representation of the genre. It is also very important to know that this album was created from scratch. So Eminem really gives us a great and honest album. The only thing I wish Eminem would do is change the name to "Eminem the Album". The name is a negative aspect. So Eminem can only do a good album by changing the name.

Amazon review: I thought this album was really good. It has some great songs. I have listened to this twice now. It's definitely a classic. I think it is the best hip hop album Eminem has released. I have listened to it a lot. I love the way he writes songs. The lyrics are very deep. I love how he goes deeper and deeper with the lyrics until they are very meaningful. This album has a very unique sound. I love the sound of this album. The only thing I have a problem with is the way it is recorded. I wish there were more songs on the album that were recorded in a studio. But this album is definitely a classic.

Amazon review: I really like this album. This was my first Eminem album. I have listened to it a lot. I like the way Eminem writes. I like the way he sings. I love how he raps. This album is very important to the hip hop genre. It is definitely a great representation of the genre. I also think this album is very important to the hip hop genre. Eminem is the only hip hop artist to release an album with a totally different sound. Eminem has definitely created a new way of performing rap. So that is why this album is so important. This album is also very important to the hip hop genre because it is the first hip hop album to have a completely different sound. Eminem is the first rapper to release an album completely different from his previous releases. So the only way to really understand this album is to listen to it. So to me, this album is a really great representation of the hip hop genre. I also think this album is very important to the hip hop category because it is the first hip hop album to have a totally different sound. He is the only hip hop artist to release an album completely different from his previous releases. So the only method to really determine which albums Eminem has released is to listen to them.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I am a huge Robert Johnson fan.  I have been listening to him since I was 5, with a little help from my parents.  This cd is another great listen, I've been playing it for hours.  I couldn't wait to get it and it was worth the wait.  I have it in the car and I listen to it in the car while I drive.  I don't go anywhere, I'm not interested in the sound.  I only listen to it in the car.  It is great.  I also own the Robert Johnson and Mahalia Jackson CDs and I find it very similar to the two.  I am a huge fan of both of these singers.  I'm glad that I bought this cd and hope to get more of their cd's in the future.  I will probably never get the Mahalia Jackson cd's; I'm a Mahalia Jackson fan and I can't stand the cd.  I've had three Mahalia Jackson CDs in my life, I will probably never get them.  I would love to have a Robert Johnson cd for the life of me, I've been in love with him ever since I heard him.  I can't believe it took me so long to get this CD, I only have it on hold for about a month and I can't wait to get it.  I just love his voice and music.  I have listened to the cd many, many times, I've tried to listen to it for years and don't quite get it but I listen to it again and again.  I'm glad I did.

It was a cd I bought at the time of the original release, and I was really excited about getting it when it came out.  It was a great cd.  When I bought it, I was young, and I bought it out of love.  I was listening to it in my car, and I was just blown away by his vocals.  I would recommend this cd to anyone.  I was fortunate enough to get this cd in the past, and I can't wait for the new release to come out.  I will be getting it as soon as I can.  It is one of my favorite cd's ever.  I just love his voice and the way he sings.  I'm glad I got it when I did.

I have a lot of albums on this site that are very enjoyable to listen to.  This one is a great cd.  It is a great cd, I love it.  I am a fan of Robert Johnson, and I have been listening to him since I was a little kid, even back in the Allman Brothers days.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I bought this album when it first came out. I love it. It has a message of encouragement and is about the real message God is trying to communicate to us. I know that God loves me. He sent me to me and He's always with me and will never leave me. I can be a Christian just like Jesus. This is the only way I know how to be happy.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this CD, but it's not very good.  The singing is extremely good, but the lyrics are not.  It's more of a generic pop song with some annoying lyrics.  I'm glad I bought it, but I don't even know if I want to hear more of this singer's music.  I'll probably listen to it someday, but only because I want to know what the original song sounded like.  That's all I'll say.  I've heard this CD for the past 3 or 4 months and I can't stand it.  It's so bad that I'm thinking of not buying it.

Overall: 4.5

This album is a must have for all eminem fans!

The album starts out with a very good song called "This Is America" and then it takes off into a song called "My Name Is" and then into a song called "Hate Me Now" and then into a song called "My Name Is" and then into a song that is an almost completely different song called "This Is America" and then it goes into "My Name Is" and then it goes into "Hate Me Now" and then it goes into "My Name Is" and then it gets back into a song called "This Is America" and then it goes into a song called "Hate Me Now" and then it goes into a song called "My Name Is" and then it goes into a song called "This Is America" and then it goes into "MyName Is" and then it goes into a song called "Hate Me Now".

After "My Name Is" it goes into "This Is America" and then it goes into a song called "This Is America" (again) and then it goes into "My Name Is" and then it goes back into "This Is America" and then it gets into a song called "My Name Is" and then it goes into "Hate Me" and then it goes into a song called "My Name Is" (again) and then it goes into a song called "This Is America" and goes into a song called "Hate Me Now" and then it gets into a song called "My Name Is" (again) and then the song goes into a song called "This Is America" (again) and goes back into "My Name Is" (again) and then it goes into a different song called "Hate Me Now" and then it goes back to a song called "This Is America" and then it goes into a different song called "Hate Me Now".

I really like the songs and I am hoping that they are released on a different album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is the second in a three part series of recordings from the band.  The first part is a tribute to the fallen soldiers of World War II.  The third part is a tribute to the victims of the September 11th attacks ( the first two part albums did not include any songs about the attacks).  This album is a very good addition to any hard rock collection.  They have a very good sound and the sound is not very busy.  They have a very good rhythm section and a very good lead guitar player.  The lyrics are very interesting.  There are some very good tracks on this album, one being a tribute to the fallen soldiers of World War II, two being a tribute to the victims of the September 11th attacks and one being a tribute to the fallen soldiers of the Vietnam War.  Overall this is a very good album.  I will definitely be purchasing the other two parts of this series.

Twiztid, which is also owned by the rapper Madrox, has released two albums in the first five days of February.  The first,  Mixtape 2, has a good sound but not the highest quality sound.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times today. I love the music. The lyrics are very positive and uplifting. I love the message of the song, and the fact that it is a hymn. Each song is so well sung and the singers are all unique. I love this CD and can only imagine what the world would be like if it were sung by the entire choir. I would love to have this CD on my car stereo and have the choir sing about God and bring Him to everyone. I would love to make a video to show everyone how God is good and God is worthy to be praised.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I would love to see them do it.  I still love the song but it is not right.
