Amazon review: This is one of the better collections out there. Some very hard to find songs on this wonderful 3 cd set. Comes in a very nice hard plastic box 3 cd holder which is rare these days. Most multi-cd set cases are flimsy and fall apart quickly. Not this one. This is a bargain. It seems that the previous review was for the wrong CD.

Amazon review: Van Halen were never great nor prolific songwriters, mostly a good cover band with a livewire, athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar players in the history of rock.  Probably a great bar band when they started out.  I saw them twice in their early days, when I was a teenager who didn't care that DLR was a mediocre singer at best.  Loved his energy and the musical chops of the rest of the band.  Unfortunately, whatever vocal talent he ever possessed, has long since evaporated.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

If I could only get to the end of the song all the way without having to keep rewinding, I would most likely buy it.

Amazon review: You know, I'm just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the differences from original to remastered. But I will say, paying $60 (or $70 or $80) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous. I am probably like a large contingent of Springsteen fans; I became aware during the Born in the USA tour, then purchased all the previous cassettes. So, in the last 28 years, cassettes were lost and/or became obsolete. Now I am able to purchase all seven for what amounts to $8.

When I finally saw the article, I realized why. The author left out the fact that Chris Cornell is a talented singer. He was not a good singer before this, but after this he is. He is a good singer and I would like to see him have more success. He is a great performer and a great vocalist. Chris Cornell should be given a chance to get back in the limelight.

Amazon review: This is actually a great song. I am truly a died hard fan for K. Michelle so I do not mind keeping it real. It is about time she is singing something that is a "make up record." She has always recorded break-up records and albums, and now it is great and surprising to hear her sing something new. She is crazy, sometimes rude and take things to the extreme, but one thing that is true is that she can sing! Support real music and trust she will deliver.

Amazon review: This "artist" leaves a lot to be desired.  I actually tried to listen to a little bit of this and and keep an open mind.  But I found myself not being able to get past the first thirty seconds.  It is the same regurgitated drivel that is all too commonly passes for music today.  Save your money or get it on bootleg.  Personally I wouldn't take this for free.  Add to the fact that this artist seems to enjoy the company of thieves, cop killers, drug addicts and ex cons.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not a "new" song at all, but a rerecording of a song that was originally recorded in 1983.  It was the first single from the newly-formed band, The Black Eyed Peas and they still have no idea how to properly market it.  They are trying to get the song on the radio with it's original B-Side being "I'll Be Missing You".  They have no idea how to promote it, no idea how to market it, and no idea how to get it on the radio.  They have tried to get the song on the radio by "promoting" it with the help of MTV, which has no interest in any of the Black Eyed Peas and will only play songs from artists they already have a commercial relationship with.   There are no radio stations that will play a new song by a group that has no interest in promotion.  The Black Eyed Peas need to release the song on the radio, in high quality CD Quality, with the original B-Side, and make it available to all radio stations.  That would be a great idea.

Amazon review: I wish I could give a better rating, but this is the first song I ever heard of Dick Jonas and I thought it was a great song.  I have been a fan of his for a long time and I don't think I could give him a higher rating than this right now.  I love this song and I think this is something that he just has to release to get the attention he needs.

Amazon review: I bought this CD years ago when I was in the Army and I knew I would just have to have it.  I have always enjoyed his music.  I love the way he sings and the way he makes you feel.  When this song was released, I bought it right away.  I have listened to it many times over the years.  I bought it because I wanted to hear it again.  I can listen to it over and over again.  I love the way he sings.  I love the sound of the song.  I don't know if I could give him a higher rating now.  This song is just great.

Amazon review: As a fan of TSO. we were looking forward to this new 2 CD set with great anticipation. When it arrived, we immediately slid it into the CD player and were very surprised and disappointed. Although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept releases by TSO, this concept left us very cool. There is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise. We are pretty sophisticated listeners with extremely diverse musical tastes, but I must say this one was a bust.

Amazon review: I am constantly amazed that today's musical groups have such little imagination that they have to cop the names of yesteryear's bands who have already earned their niches in the music world's history.. and that they do it so very badly. Bands like the People, Touch, White Witch, Armageddon,(and the list goes on and on)were extraordinary one-of-a-kinds. And yet, modern bands continue to take those names for themseles, then release inferior, common, boring music, and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in $ on the names of others.

Amazon review: This is my favourite Bob Marley song. I have a couple that I listen to on a regular basis and I love this one. I love Bob Marley in every sense of the word. This was one of the few songs that I like as a kid. I still remember listening to it, sitting on the floor of my bedroom, and listening to it and being in awe of how beautiful it was. The lyrics are great, they are about a woman who is being cheated on by her husband, and how she is in love with someone else, and how she has to leave him. I have always loved the way the lyrics to this song go, the way they just come alive and sound. I love the way Bob Marley sings this song. I think it's one of the best songs that Bob Marley has written. It's a very strong song. I think l've listened to this song probably over 500 times.

Amazon review: This is one of those perfect singles It's so simple but, so close to flawless Dave Gahan vocals even the 1980's synth keyboard sound all work to create a  flawless single that still to this day stands the test of time!  A must all around  10/10

Amazon review: Once I'd downloaded this song, I felt deceived by the sample clip available here. Cincotti definitely has potential, but he ruined what could've been a beautiful song by trying to sing high notes that were beyond his range. He sounded rather screechy. The title track was also somewhat misleading, because it led me to expect a slow, tender seduction song, not a sad one. I do think Peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing.

Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?

I'm a big fan of LeAnn Rimes and I really can't wait for her new album to come out. Her songs are truly beautiful, and her voice is amazing.

She has never released a song I've heard that sounded exactly like a live performance. Most of her songs are a work of art to me. The best lyrics are usually tucked away in the middle of the page. This song has that. The rest of the band is a delight to listen to. I highly recommend this song.

Love this song and her voice. I've always loved her music and have been waiting for this song. You can tell that the band has put a lot of work into it. Like I said, it's the best song I've heard from her yet and I've listened to her songs hundreds of times.

A really good song. The song was enjoyable and sounded like it was performed by an angel. I've been looking for

Amazon review: For a while it seemed that Taylor Swift could do no wrong. Even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular songs, with each album outshining the last one. Swift would even prove her doubters who would claim that "third time is rarely the charm" false when she came up with her best-to-date album Speak Now, which, like Fearless, is laced with big-girl wisdom that anyone can nod his/her head to.

Amazon review: Oh boy. Now we're getting into the "real" Swift stuff. That's right. The album is called Red, and the lead single is a cover of the Aretha Franklin hit "Chain of Fools." It's got a strong enough chorus that, as the song's title proclaims, "If you can figure it out, you can have it."

Amazon review: I've been in love with the Chicago sound for a long time. I got the original Chicago album way back in the middle of the seventies, and it remains a favorite. I love the way the band sounds live as well. It's a sound that's simply unmatched.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't know if there is a real winner here. I think that the original Chicago album is definitely the best. But this album is quite a bit better than the original. The new album, which is definitely the worst, is filled with all the worst elements of rap. It's a mess--and you can't get that music on an MP3.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is great. I had been listening to the original albums for years before I heard this latest release, but I have to admit I was very much on the fence with this one. I'm not a fan of the new rap music or the new urban sound. I've always liked the Chicago sound, and this is a great addition to that lineup.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the only album I have ever bought and I feel that the album is great. I have heard this album a few times but each time I hear it I am amazed at how good the songs are. The artists on this album are great and they write great lyrics.

###
Amazon review: I just saw the new "Chicago" album. I listened to it and had to laugh. I think it's a terrible album. I liked the first and second ones, but the songs on this one are just awful. They are just so generic and boring. I have heard all of this album and I have to say that I am not a fan. I think they have gone off the deep end.

Amazon review: This album is a must have for anyone looking to hear some very creative rock tunes with a'pop' edge to it. With a very high level of musicianship, Dale will take you anywhere from an experimental and psychedelic rock tunes to some more modern acoustic'folky' songs. Amazing songwriting musically and lyrically!

Amazon review: I just love it.  The music is will done.

###
Amazon review: I never purchased it, it piggy backed on another order and claims i wanted it. besides that its awful. whiny voices, cheesy boring and silly. sounds like typical office people trying to "get in touch" with emotions and make a"moving" song lol.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I need to quantify my review up front. In my dictionary, you look up the words'music', 'class brass',' professional', and you'll see CHICAGO. Anyone who knows me, knows that CHICAGO is, and has been, my favourite group since dirt, hands down. The only other band closer is the Beatles. I own every 331/3 album, and every cd, twice. My key chain says "CHICAGO". My refrigerator and front door has CHICAGO magnets inside and out. Anything with the CHICAGO logo on it gets saved.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this album is great and I hope it is a hit, however I don't like most of the songs. The opener "Stripped" is the only good song here. I would have enjoyed the rest of the album if it wasn't full of annoying repetitive lyrics and a stupid song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought this song, hoping that this version also included the verse as well as the refrain. Sadly, it's only the refrain. My mom used to sing this song around the house, and I had searched for a long time for a recording (with words).
