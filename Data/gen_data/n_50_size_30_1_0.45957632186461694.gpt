Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I don't normally like metal, but these guys were a little bit different, I love the sound of them.  I like that they have a little bit of country in there too. They have a little bit of a grunge rock sound and a little of a punk rock sound.  I love the mix in there.  I just feel that the songs are unique and when it came to the vocals I was a little bit disappointed.  I feel that the vocals were not the best but I still enjoyed it.  They are definately a band to listen to, you will like them.

Amazon review: The album is just okay.  The lyrics are great and the music is great.  I think it would be good if the band wrote more lyrics.  I liked the old songs.  I heard a lot of new songs and thought they were good.  I think the sound was like a mix of old punk rock and new pop rock.  But it was very mixed and I would like the band to write some new songs.  I wish they would sing a lot more.  I mean, I like some of the songs but they have to sing a lot more and sing more.  I think they do not sing very much.  The lyrics are great.  They are very unique and different from the other bands I heard.

Amazon review:  This album got a 5 star rating because of the quality of the music.  I just wish they would have had more songs on this cd.  The vocals are not so good.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: The CD contains one track that is actually good and one track that is not.  The good track is one that I can only imagine was written by the composer, but it was not sung by the singer. The bad track is a song that I can only assume was written by the composer, but I can only imagine that it was sung by the singer. It is very hard to believe that the composer would have composed with such a terrible, atrocious and awful singer. I hope the music industry is a better place without these people.

Amazon review: I love the Beatles. I will always listen to their songs even though I have to have some kind of a hard core Beatles fan to go along with me. There is so much to this album. The songs are great, the arrangements are great, the musicianship is great. It has a classic feel to it, but not in the way that many people think. I thought they were great and I was lucky enough to have heard them when they were young. They were very well known and people knew about them. They were very good and they had a great reputation. They started out as a group, but one of the members left and formed his own band. Then, John Lennon went to jail and was not able to write songs, and Paul McCartney went on to form the band Wings. So, now we have a band called the Beatles, and I love this band, so I love this album. I think it is a masterpiece, and I would recommend anyone to buy this album.

My boss is a Christian and I thought it was a beautiful song to have on the car speaker.  It was also the first time he heard the song and he liked it.  The song "You Can Do Better"  is a great song and I would recommend that song to anyone who is a song writer.  I never thought that I would get a free CD,  but I have to give an honest review on all the other songs.  I have to give a negative review for the other songs that I don't like.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is the best western swing album I have heard in a long, long time.  The first two discs are great, but this one really takes it to a whole new level.

Amazon review: I got this CD as a gift.  I am really enjoying this album.  I am glad I picked up this CD.  This is one of my favorites.

I like Bob and Thalia's version of this song much better than the version that was previously played.

Amazon review: A good start to a wonderful western swing CD.  I do not like Bill's vocals on this album.  I think he had better vocals on "Love Me Tender" or "Blue Eyes" or "It's Raining Men", etc.  In other words, I think he had better vocals on his previous albums.  I think this album is a good introduction to Bill's music.  I wish Bill had recorded more albums like this.  I am glad I bought this CD.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like Meghan Trainor's music and I'm glad she has an amazing voice.  I just can't get into this CD and am giving it a 1 star rating.  I'm not really a fan of modern pop music, I like music I can relate to.  I don't like the music style, and the lyrics are just too generic.  I wish Meghan would write songs about love, not about sex.  I think this is just one of those CDs that has a good beat, great lyrics, great melody, and a great hook.  Just don't get on my nerves.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

The songs are great and the musicianship is excellent.  I do wish the songs were longer, but most of the songs are short.  The CD is worth the money if you are a fan of jazz and rock music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is a real gem.  I have only had one CD in my collection that has been worth buying,  this is it.  The musicianship is really, really good.  You  can tell that the musicians are really good and have played together for a long time.  The musicianship is really exceptional and you can tell from the musicians it takes a lot of dedication to play music together for a very long time.  They sound great, especially on this CD.  I will definitely buy this CD again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I did find this CD to be a good bargain.  The CD can be purchased for about $5, and I spent approximately $20 on it.  I think that is a fair price for a good CD.  The CD is worth the money but I don't think I will buy it again.  I would have to say I will buy it as a gift for someone else.  I don't think I would buy it again.  It would be a waste of money.  I thought I was going to like it but I don't.  I think the musicianship is great, but the songs just don't sing.  I would not buy it again.  It is a little too slow.  I would not recommend it.  The songs are a little slow, and you can tell that the songs are not written by a band that you would want to hear.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a well recorded CD, but I think it is worth about a couple of dollars.  I love this CD.  I bought it because I was looking for something to play on my record player.  I have a CD player that I bought for about $100 years ago.  It plays pretty good but I do not think it is worth $100.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This CD sounds pretty good but not worth $11.  I bought this CD expecting it to sound better than other CDs I have bought.  It sounds pretty good but I think it is worth about a couple of dollars.  I'm not a big fan of jazz but I do like a lot of other types of music.  I do like the horns, but I am not a big fan of the music.

Amazon review: I have not heard this CD and I will listen to it when I get home.  I will go back to the store and buy the CD if I am not able to listen to it right away.  The CD is worth about 1 dollar.  I will get a few other CDs and listen to them at home.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The best CD I have heard in a long time.  The sound is great and the musicianship is top notch.  I am not sure if the CD was recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival or not, but I don't care.  The CD is worth the money.  I could listen to it for hours.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the most authentic sound I have ever heard.  My ears are the best judge of authenticity.  You can't really tell.  But, there is enough here to be worth the price of admission.  If you like the originality of the music I think you'll like these guys.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I just got this CD and I've listened to a few songs.  I've really been waiting for this album.  My ears were ready for a CD with an authentic R&B sound.  All of the musicians that performed on this CD are from the Richmond area.  I was really impressed with the musicianship on this CD.  I've only listened to a few songs, but they all sound so professional.  I give this CD four stars.  I give this CD four stars.  I give this CD two stars.  I give this CD one star.

Amazon review: This is a very good sounding, well recorded, high quality recording.  The only thing I would say is the bassist is a bit too loud for my taste.  The other things are fine.  I could see this release being very popular.  I think this is a great way to introduce R&B to a new audience.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD is a great example of what a R&B disc should sound like.  The musicians really bring it.  The song selection is great, and the song quality is really high.  The only thing that I cannot figure out is the bass vocalist and the sax player.  They do not come up with the same chord on every note.  It is not just one chord they are doing.  I am looking forward to the rest of the album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Dillinja & Deee-Lite for a long time.  They have a great sound and are always entertaining.  This album is no different.  The chorus is so repetitive and it just makes it seem like they are trying to push out new material as fast as possible.  I am not a fan of this album and I am also not a fan of Dillinja.  I am not a fan of Deee-Lite either.  They are just not good enough to be considered for being in the same band.

It's so good and it makes every song on the album better.  I really like this album.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves hip-hop or funk and has a little extra money or wants something different.

It's just lame.  I just wish he didn't do that.  The beat on "Candyman" also sounds like a sample.  It's just too bad.  I wouldn't mind hearing this album again.  I don't think the song "I.M.
