Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

I can't wait to hear his new CD "Keith Sweat And The Heartbreak Jam".  Just when I was getting tired of hearing his old covers, he comes out with another great CD.

Amazon review: I love Keith Sweat, and I know many do as well.  However, this is the worst Keith Sweat, ever.  I believe that Keith Sweat has some talent, but this is simply a terrible album.  I believe that he should release a CD that is just him singing old standards and then sing some of his new songs.  Instead, I have to buy this album.  He is still the best Keith Sweat and this album is simply not worthy of Keith Sweat.

Amazon review: I have a very hard time buying CDs with any of the artists I love.  I have read that there is a great chance that I will find that the CD is a re-record of an old song.  I don't have a problem with that.  Keith Sweat, on the other hand, is the only artist that I have had to purchase a CD from that I didn't have to search for on the Internet.  In fact, I could have just found out about the CD on the Internet!  And I am not talking about those CDs that come with a CD-ROM, I mean CDs that come with a printed-on-CD CD booklet.  I have had to buy the CD, and read the booklet, and then I have to find a CD player to play the CD.  That CD is not just on the Internet, it is on the front page of various music magazines.  I have never had to find a CD player.  You just buy the CD at the store, and the CD comes with the CD booklet that has all of the artwork.  Keith Sweat is one of the few artists that has been able to give me a CD with just the CD booklet and the CD.  I really like that CD booklet.  They tell you where the CDs are recorded, who the performers are, and what the songs are about.  I have no problem with the CDs, the CDs are good.  And I really like the CD booklet.  But if you can't handle the cost of the CD, then you shouldn't have to buy the CD.  If you have the CD, you should be able to find the CD player, or at least the CD player that came with the CD.  And then you should be able to play the CD on the CD player.  Keith Sweat is one of the few artists that I have had to search the Internet for more than once!  I will now have to buy this CD and read the booklet over and over again, and then find a CD player to play it on.

Amazon review: If this CD is not a re-recording of an old song, I don't know what is.  It is simply a re-recording of an old song that is better than the original recording.  I don't know who did this song, but I like the song.  I just don't like this song.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.

Amazon review: I was looking for something with the sound of the first Floyd album, something that had a little bit of texture.

Amazon review: This is better than the previous Pink Floyd album, but not by much.  I would have preferred a Pink Floyd album that played songs by the same artists in the same order, or even in the same style as the first Floyd album.

This compilation has been a great tribute to the fours seasons.

But then again, I don't really think that is a good reason to dislike a song. Because if it's good, I like it. But, I'd rather hear a couple of hours worth of music than hear the same band twice. I don't think there are any other albums with the quality of this one. This album is good.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of bands like the band that you mentioned like Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer etc. I listen to what they are playing a lot and I would listen to a lot of bands like that.

I was surprised that they didn't put out a live album, I would have liked that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm just listening to "Death by Stereo" now, I know it's a good album, but I'm not getting it. I'm not a Slayer fan, but I'm sure I will be when I'm older. My other favorites would be "Mankind Divided" by Metallica, "The Black Album" by Slayer, and "Overkill" by Megadeth.

Amazon review: I have to say that I was very impressed with this album. I was a big fan of the music of Metallica and I have to say this is easily the best of them all. It's an awesome album, but it's not a classic. The reason I say that is because the songs are not nearly as good as the rest of the albums by Metallica. I guess this album is better than the rest of the band's albums in the sense of being better as a whole, but the songs don't have the same quality. They're not as good as the other Metallica albums. I don't know how this album was mastered, but it's not a very good album.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: This album is a great collection of original songs from a singer who is in a class by himself.  I'm not sure how I've managed to overlook this album for so long, but I do have to admit that I'm a little bit disappointed.  His singing is superb, and he should have been able to make a masterpiece, but not only is the album good, it's got a great feel to it.  The songs are all very memorable and have a great feel to them.  However, the album is a little short on content, and I'm not quite sure where the songs are going to end up.  I'm hoping he'll just have the album finish and release a second album with a collection of the remaining songs on it, which would be nice.  I know that I'll find a lot of the songs just wonderful.

Amazon review: This is a remarkable album and a perfect introduction to the artist.  I really loved Josh, even though I always know what he will do next.

I've always considered him to be one of the best singer-songwriters in the world and his work will always be considered a classic in my books.  He was absolutely brilliant, and when I first heard him, I was blown away.  I've been a big fan of his ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I know that I'm not likely to be able to give an objective opinion on this album, but this has got to be one of the best albums I've heard in a long time.  Josh is a real, real original and I would die to hear him sing this kind of music ever again.  He's got a great voice, a great band, and he has a great heart.  This album is a real masterpiece.

Amazon review: This album has a great deal of content, and I think he's done a great job with this album.  He's got a great voice, he's got a great, great band, and he's got a great heart.

Amazon review: This album is great, and I'm glad that I finally have a chance to review it.  I have been a fan of Josh for years, and I've always been a fan of his work.  I think there is nothing that he doesn't do really well, and I'm glad that I finally have a chance to hear him in concert.

Netflix UK review:  I'm an old school music fan who loves to hear new things.  I've been a fan of Josh Gold's work for a long time, and as soon as I heard him play at the Royal Festival Hall, I knew I had to have this album.  I've always loved his voice, and I was really pleased to find out that he has a new album coming out.  I'm glad I finally had the chance to actually hear him live, and I think he's got a fantastic band as well.  I've always thought that he could be one of my favorite singers in the world, and I know that he's one of the best in the business.  I'm really delighted that I finally had the chance to listen to it.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I have had this album in my collection for some time now and I am looking forward to it. It has a good selection of songs that are not usually played. I have even bought the other two albums that Hendrix did after he went to the hospital. I have never liked the Hendrix sound before but this album is so different from the other two.

Amazon review: I like the album. I am not a huge Hendrix fan and I have always been a huge Rolling Stones fan but when I heard that I had the opportunity to buy this album, I figured I would give it a shot just to see what it was all about. I can honestly say that I am not a huge fan of Jimi Hendrix either. I do like the song "Tattoo" though.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this is a good album. The only problem I have with it is that I don't know how much Hendrix material there is on it. The only one I can think of is "Blind Man" and its not even a Hendrix song. I would give it a chance though just to see what it is all about.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have listened to this album a lot. I find it very interesting. I am not a big Hendrix fan but I am a big Rolling Stones fan. I bought this album because I love this band.

Amazon review: Love the song it's so uplifting and I play it three or four times a day just to get moving!

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Love this album. I used to be a huge Rod Stewart fan. I thought he was so amazing, and I loved his voice. Then I discovered him, and then I found this record. I love his voice, and he's so talented. And it's so hard to find a great artist. I'll keep him in my favorites.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I thought this album was released in 2002, but I was wrong. I bought this album in 2002, and I didn't know it was released in 2002. I never really heard it before, and I'm not sure who it was released on. But I got this album for free through a friend from the U.K. He told me to buy it, so I did, and I'm glad I did.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: When I first started listening to this album, I thought that there was a lot of "good" songs on it, but that was because I was young and I was still a teenager, and I didn't realize that there was a lot of bad songs on the album, because I didn't know any better at the time.
Now, after having owned it for a long time, I know that it is pretty average. It's not bad, but I can't say that it's great either. However, it was one of the first albums I purchased after I had discovered that I was transgender, and I would have bought this album again just to have a record to listen to and to have my gender identity affirmed, but I couldn't afford to buy this album again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is my all time favorite album and I think it's the best album ever made. It made me who I am. I'm not a big fan of Rod Stewart, but this album makes me love him even more.

Amazon review: This is a great album. I love it. I think it is very important to have songs like this in the world.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums for the simple reason that it is one of the best songs ever written. I mean, think about it...this song is on the soundtrack to the movie, "Losing My Religion".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like this album, it has some great songs on it, such as "C'mon Get Down" and "We Got the Beat". I like the fact that it is a lot better then most of the stuff I have heard that is supposed to be good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the best album and I love the fact that it is the only album that I own that has never been altered. I have always been a big fan of Rod Stewart and I have never had the opportunity to get his CDs. But this album is different. It is definitely the best album that I have ever owned.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is really the best rock and roll album that I have ever heard. The song "I Need a Girl" is an anthem. The first time I heard it, I got goose bumps. I have always had a very close relationship with Rod Stewart and his music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this album is the best album I have ever owned. I started listening to it a few years ago (I'm on my second copy) and I just can't get enough of it. It's just so perfect. I love the fact that it is just the way I like it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this album, but I don't love it. I think it's a great album but it's not my favorite. I love what they did with The Star. I think they made the album better.

Amazon review: I love this album! I love the fact that it is very similar to the music that I love but at the same time it's not the same! If it was, then I would be happy!

Amazon review: I have this album for a long time and I love it, but I don't think the songs on it are as good as the ones on "Love Is All Around". On the other hand, the songs on "Love Is All Around" are more personal and more personal and I think that "Love Is All Around" is more personal.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "Love Is All Around" is a great album and I think it is probably one of the best albums I have ever owned. I have a lot of favorites and I have to say that this album is one of
