Amazon review: I never had an interest in classical music, but this album caught my interest when I heard about it on CD Baby. I was looking for classical music on CD Baby, and a "song list" came up on the search. I found out that the music I liked was in the "song list" and then I clicked on it and it took me to the album. I love the album! I don't know if it's just an overall positive review, but this is the first album I've ever purchased from CD Baby.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I've heard that there are more than 100 songs on this album, but after two listens, I realize that there isn't a single one that I didn't like.  I'm a sucker for a good song, but I'm not a sucker for a bad song.  The music is so much better when they are writing originals.  I'm not sure what it is about this CD, but it's just not that good.  You have to really get into the music to listen to it.

Amazon review: I don't think I've heard a album that sounds this bad. I really liked this album, and I loved the song, "What They Don't Know" but I don't think it's been the best since the first album.  The second album was better, but this one is just not that good.  It's one song after another of mediocre songwriting.  I don't know why they are still touring so much. I wish I could go to the shows and just watch the band, but I can't. I hope this album isn't made into a movie.  I'm going to go back and listen to the second album before I leave this review.

Amazon review:  I know I've said this before, but I'm not crazy about the music and lyrics of this album.  I don't think that these songs are as important as the rest of the songs on the album.  It's just one song after another of mediocre songwriting.  I don't know what it is about this CD, but it's just not that good, but it's a catchy song.  I can't believe how much I still like this album. It's amazing that I like it as much as I do.  I still don't like how the band has been touring so much.  I hope these shows are not recorded and it will be on DVD.  I was going to buy this album to hear it for the first time, but I can't.  I'll probably still buy it when I go back to see their concerts.  I'm going to get the first album back instead.

Amazon review:  The song "What They Don't Know" is a good song, but the lyrics are just stupid.  They are about a girl leaving her boyfriend and getting ready to go back to school.  Then she says that he doesn't understand her, but she doesn't care.  She's leaving him anyway.  I don't know why we need to be talking about this song.  The song is still a good song, but the lyrics are just dumb.

Amazon review: If you listen to this album, you are going to hear the songs in the same order as the songs on the first album. When you hear the first three songs on this album, go listen to "Why Do You Want to Know" first.  Then listen to "What They Don't Know", then listen to "What About Love", then listen to "You Make Me Feel" then listen to "You Are the Reason".  The song "What They Don't Know" is just bad.  This album is a waste of money.  I don't know why they are still making albums.  I want to like this record, but I just don't.  I like this album, but I don't like me and my problems.

Amazon review: Love the new record but I think it is too mainstream for many. Too many rap and hip hop references and so on.  It is better to listen to the first and second albums back to back instead of just listening to one song here and there.  The production sounds very similar to the first and second albums, but have a different feel.  I like the rap vocals as well as the other raps.  I like the album.  I have one or two favorite songs, but there are so many good songs.  I think in the future, they may try to get more radio play by making more of the songs a little more adventurous and different.  Good album, good songs, but too much of the same.  The new singles are pretty good as well.  I feel like the next album will be better.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: The music from the Schubert opera 'Die Fliegenden, Die Inseln' is a marvelous collection. The songs are beautifully performed by the Schubert family and others. I was disappointed that the recording was not the Schumann original.  It's a wonderful collection to be enjoyed and performed again and again.

Amazon review: I purchased this collection of Schubert songs the same day that it came out. I could not believe my ears when I heard this collection.  I was completely blown away.  My previous collection of songs was not on CD.  I had to buy the compilation album to play these songs.  I am very excited about this collection of songs.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I have listened to this many times, and I like it. This is definitely a different take. I like the upbeat feel of the song, and the song itself. I would like to know the reason why the song ends abruptly. I can understand why they couldn't do it in a studio, but this is one of those songs that just ends. There is nothing left to say.

Amazon review: This song is great. My son and I are not fans of rap at all, but this song is so great that we both really enjoyed it. It has a powerful message about life, love, and the ability to change the world. This song really helps me to stop and think about things more and feel less stressed out. I am a pretty negative person, but this song has a really positive message to really help me. I think it would be great for a Christmas song. It's a nice change from the typical Christmas carols. I would definitely listen to this again.

Amazon review: When I first heard this song, I thought it would be an interesting message for Christmas, but once I heard the lyrics, I realized it was about life. This song is a little more mature.

Amazon review: This is the second best song from this album. I was hoping that the second single from the album would be better, but this song is quite good.

Amazon review: This song is so wonderful! It is so powerful and also thought provoking. This song is great for a Christmas song.

In this day and age, it is nearly impossible to know what is going to happen in the future. In order to make informed decisions, we need to know what is going on, and what we are going to do. If we do not know, we may make decisions that are regretful. We can no longer sit back and let others tell us what to do. We must know what is going on. This is the purpose of the Internet.

You can be sure that I have researched a lot of information on the Internet. Many websites that I have investigated have given me the best information. I have found information that has helped me to make informed decisions. If you want to know what is going to happen in the future, you need to know what is going on now.

I was born with my head in the clouds. I have always wanted to know what is going on in the world. I wanted to find out what is going to happen. I wanted to know what is going to happen. I thought that I knew what was going to happen. I thought that I knew what I was going to do. I thought that I knew what was going to happen. I thought I knew what is going to happen. I thought

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I don't know why these two are together.  The songs are good, but I don't know why they are together and I don't know why AI is even there.  AI has not done anything to make me like the songs or the album, maybe because it's too generic and the vocals are too generic.  I just don't know.

Amazon review: I had a lot of fun with this album.  I bought it on a whim and I was really excited by it.  However, I don't see what's wrong with the songs.  I like them.  I think they're a little too similar for some reason.  AI's songs are in my opinion very well put together and he has a good voice.  His songs are a little generic but that's not a bad thing.

Amazon review: This album sucks.  It's a disappointment.  It's not a bad album, just not a great one.  The only thing is I enjoyed the cover.  I wouldn't say I thought it was original, but I did like it.  I don't know how I could have possibly thought that this album would be any different from the old AI albums or any other covers.  In fact, it's pretty close to the last AI album.  I guess I just expected a lot more.  I don't know.  I expected a lot more from AI.  It's okay to me, but it's just not what I would call a great album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

The worst album of all time.

Amazon review:  This song is a beautiful love song. I have never heard anyone sing with such a powerful voice and such a beautiful voice. And the way that the music is arranged just makes it even more beautiful. I love the way that this song is divided into two parts. One part is a slower part and then the second part is a faster part. The part where the music slows down is beautiful and gives you that feeling of a beautiful love song. I love the part where the music speeds up and the part where the music is played in the background is just beautiful. I love the part where the music is played in the background so you can hear the music without the instrument. I love the part where the music is played in the background so the instruments are the only things you can hear. This song is a beautiful love song.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I bought this CD to listen to in the car.  I liked the CD and it was good.  I liked the arrangement.  I liked the first two songs.  I like the third song.  I didn't like the last two songs.  The last two songs were not good.  I had a feeling that the CD would have been better with more guitar on it.  I wish I had asked for this CD in the store, but I didn't.  I will probably not buy this CD again.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of this CD.  I usually order CD's when I find them at the library or in a local store.  This CD was a bit different.

An Australian who lives in the UK. I'm addicted to watching Netflix. I'm also an avid music listener but I have to say I do not like Eminem in any capacity. I've been listening to him for years and I'm not going to start.

To be honest, I'm quite disturbed by the whole Eminem thing. He's an excellent songwriter but that doesn't mean he can be a musical genius. As a result, his music is filled with flaws. His lyrics are boring, his flow is choppy, his rapping is horrible. He's a terrible rapper. He should stick to the written word and not the microphone. He sounds like a guy from the seventies who doesn't know how to rap. As a result, he's mediocre

He's got a lot of potential if he could stop trying to be so popular and start being himself. He could sell a lot of records and be able to tour.

His new album is a perfect example of how to do business and how to do it right. He's got a beautiful songwriting style and he's a great lyricist. These are the two things that he needs to become great.

I'm not going to listen to his next album, and I'm not going to watch his next video. He's not a musical genius and he's not a great rapper. I'm not going to watch any of his videos.

What I'm going to do is watch the old Em movies. I'm sure he will do his best to get the right message across. And I'm sure he's going to get the best reception from a lot of people.

I'm not going to put up a review until I've seen the whole album but I'm going to rate it 1.5 stars.

I was looking for eminem music and I found this album really great.I also listen to Eminem songs and every album has some good songs. Eminem is a great eminem rapper and also a good eminem songwriter.

This is the best Eminem album that I have ever heard. You can enjoy this album and you will be able to enjoy Eminem songs as well.

I am a little disappointed with this album. It's not a bad album but it's not great. I like the music and I like the songs on the album but there are songs that I just don't like. I think that the songwriting is the best part of the album.

My only complaint is that the lyrics are so bad. The songs are great but the lyrics are awful. I really didn't like the album.

I like eminem and i was looking for his new album but i was disappointed.
Not the best album ever but not the worst either.

I bought his album and i have listened to it a couple of times.I love the songs and he is a good eminem songwriter.This is a great album

I really really like this album. It's a great eminem album.This is the most eminem album i have ever had the pleasure to listen to.It's a good eminem album.

I'm very sorry to say this but I have to give this album a very low rating. Eminem has become a little too popular and he has managed to alienate a lot of his fans with his songs. I'm not sure about this album because there are a few songs that really don't sound like him but there are some good eminem songs on here.

I'll give this album a 3 out of 5 because it does have a few good songs but overall it's a 4 out of 5 because it's not bad.

I'm not a big fan of Eminem and I really don't like his music. I only bought the album on the basis of his songwriting.

I haven't listened to the whole album yet but it seems like a very good album. It wasn't bad at all. I can't really

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I purchased this song in November of 2000 after discovering it in a used car dealership. I was not happy when I heard the song. I purchased a couple of songs from it and they sounded great. I thought I was happy. I came back two weeks ago and heard what I thought was the end of the song. I was stunned by the poor quality of the music. It sounded like someone was playing it on a cassette tape. I went back to the used car dealership and talked to the manager and he was very nice. I explained to him that I liked the song and was excited about it. He told me that the song ended at the end of the song and he would give me $100 to take it home. I went home and listened to it and it was awful. It was all I could do to listen to it. After about 15 minutes the music stopped. I called the company and told them that I had just purchased the song and that I hated it. They assured me that I would have a new song. I have not heard the song since then. I have heard it over the past ten years and it is one of the worst songs I have ever heard. I would not recommend it.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: A solid CD.  As far as I'm concerned, this is the kind of album that would be better on vinyl.  I've listened to it over and over and the band's ability to make a good record is really impressive.  They seem to be having fun and it feels like the band is enjoying themselves.  They've got a unique sound that is well suited to their style of music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've seen the band as a joke.  The thing that made them stand out was their ability to make an interesting and original kind of music.  When you combine the kind of music they make with their lyrics that are interesting and thought provoking, combined with their unique and interesting way of making music, then I think they are a band worthy of much more attention.

They are very good, but when I get the opportunity to hear them play, I'll have to say I'm not sure I'll be able to make up my mind about them.  Maybe that's why I haven't done that yet.

Amazon review: I've liked them for a while, but this is the first time I've really been able to see them.  They have some great stuff on the CD, and some that is really good, but when I got the CD, I wasn't sure what I liked, and it isn't the songs, it's the performance.  I had hoped the CD would be more up-front, and I was surprised at how many songs were filler.  I was hoping that the CD would really represent the band, and they have a lot of great songs, but I was hoping that they would be the highlight of the album.  It's a really good CD, and I'm glad I got it.  I'll check them out again when they come back to town.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of the Smashing Pumpkins since I first heard their first album of 1987.  When I heard this album on radio, I thought it was a real killer.  But when I actually got my hands on the cd, I was disappointed because it was a real disappointment.  The album is so bad it's unbelievable.  The writing is horrible, the guitar playing is horrible, and the vocals are horrible, and the music is so boring.  If any band in the world ever came out with a bad album, they would have disbanded.  The only good thing about this album is that it's got the single "Carry On" and the song is still a hit to this day.

I feel like this is probably the last album where he can get away with the sloppy rapping...I feel like he has lost his ability to make good music.  I hope he gets the help he needs.  His music makes me feel happy and sad.  I hope he goes back to work on his music.  I love him and his music.

The only good thing about this album is that it has the single "Carry On".  The song is a hit to this day.  I think that some people's first impression of the Smashing Pumpkins is that they are a generic, boring, boring, boring band.  But I think that they are so much more that that.  It's just disappointing that the people who love this band will have to listen to this album for the rest of their lives.  I don't know if I can stand to listen to this album again.

I think it is so disappointing that a band that has been so much fun to listen to for years will have to go out this way.  I listen to the album all the time, especially when I am bored.  It is so disappointing to say the least.
