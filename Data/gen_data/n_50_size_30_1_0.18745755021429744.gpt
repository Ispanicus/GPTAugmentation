Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: This is a very simple song, but you can tell that they care about the song. And it's very catchy. I'm sure most people won't even think about the song at all, but I like that they included it. I do agree that the new version of "I Won't Dance" is slightly "different", but I believe it's still a good song. The original is one of my favorite songs. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing though.

Amazon review: I really want to like this album. I really do. I've heard a lot of bad reviews of it. It is a pretty good album, but I feel like the songs aren't done as well as they could be. I think this is a good album if you like your country and pop/alternative/alternative country. But if you want something a little more "rock" then you may not like it as much. This is an album that I would absolutely buy, and it would be a hard pass on. But I feel like I shouldn't like it.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I listened to a couple of songs, they were okay, but I could tell Meghan Trainor was not the artist.  I guess I should have done some research before buying her CD.  I'm guessing she was not born in the 30's or 40's, or she would not have such bad singing and writing skills.  I guess I'm going to have to listen to the CD again.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

He was the first one to write an opera and bring the opera to the people. Schubert was not just a composer. He was also a great producer. He produced many operas, including a few that are still performed today. Schubert was a great teacher and brought opera to the people. Schubert was the first to sing opera in the world. He was called the father of the opera and I think he is the person who deserves more credit than he is getting.

Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".

Amazon review: A "pop" band with a "Latin pop" band for a debut album.  The songs are predictable and the instrumentation is repetitive.  The lyrics are weak and the vocals are weak.  The musical arrangements are okay and the melodies are okay--but not stellar.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  The album has a lot of Latin music, but it's not Latin.  "Tango" is a little bit of Latin (especially the bass) but the rest of the music is not.  The songs are nothing more than "Latin pop" with a "Latin pop" band in a "Latin pop" band.  The guitar is a little bit of Latin pop, the horns a little bit of Latin pop, the bass a little bit of Latin pop, and the drums are a little bit of Latin pop.  The rhythm section is very repetitive, and if you listen carefully, you can hear the Latin pop music in the rhythm section.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I think this album falls into the category of "You'll Believe When We Tell You" albums.  If you enjoy pop/rock like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and the Spice Girls, you'll like this album.  If you don't like pop/rock like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Spice Girls, you won't like this album.  If you enjoy pop/rock like Britney Spears, Christina, and the Spice Girls and hate the "You'll Believe When We Tell You" genre, you might enjoy this album.  It doesn't sound like a great pop/rock album, but it is a little bit of pop/rock with a little bit of Latin pop.

Amazon review:  "I'm an old soul"  It is an amazing album full of Latin music.  The album has three tracks in Spanish, and they are all great.  The vocals are great.  The music is great.  The lyrics are great.  The arrangements are great.  The drums are great.  The guitar is great.  The bass is great.  The keyboards are great.  The production is great.  The rhythm section is great.  I don't really care about the lyrics (I know they are supposed to be about "life and love") but I do know them can't be bad.  The lyrics are not so good as to make me hate the album, and they are not so bad that I love it.

Amazon review:  This has the most Latin music I've found anywhere.  They have three songs in Spanish, and they are all great.  I like the music.  The arrangements are great.  The vocals are great.

I don't really care about the lyrics (I know they're supposed to be about "life and love"), but I do know them can't be bad.  The lyrics are pretty good--not great, but not bad.  The production is great--good enough for me to recommend this album.

Amazon review:  The most Latin album I have heard in years.  I only found this when I did a search on Amazon.  I am not a fan of the genre, but I was forced to check it out.  I did not find this album.  I bought this album just to find out the album was available.  I did not find it.  I can't believe this is the first album I have ever heard that was not available on Amazon.  I will probably buy it sometime.  I will probably buy it someday.  I will probably buy it soon.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

This is a good song, if you like the genre of blues.  If you get a chance to listen to the original recording, and you are not familiar with the song, I would really hope you would hear some of the lyrics.

This song is not very original.  It's blues-ish in the sense that it has a basic storyline, with a basic chorus.  But the song has a very generic, repetitive structure.  And the song lacks any kind of imagination.  It's a song I would listen to if I were to listen to it for the first time.  But then I would go back and listen to it again.  I don't think I've ever seen or heard a better song.

Amazon review: I really love this album and I think that Meghan Trainor has the ability to make it a smash hit.  I really like the theme of this album.  I'm not too familiar with the songwriting style of Meghan Trainor.  I feel like I've heard the same song or two on this album that I've heard on other albums that she's done.  I like that she's able to come up with something new for each song.  With the exception of the song "Wolves", all of the songs have a lot of different sounds in them. I like this style of writing.  I've always been a fan of Meghan Trainor's but I really like what she's doing now. She's taking the lyrics and turning them into music.  I feel like she's really making a different type of music.  This new style of music is really good.  The best thing about this album is that Meghan Trainor has the ability to come up with a great song.  She makes it sound like a song.  This album is a good album and I really enjoy listening to it.  I don't know if I would call her a good singer but she definitely has the ability to make something sound like a great song.  I think this is one of her best albums yet.  I think she's really growing as a singer.  I'm glad she's singing on the radio and on the TV.  I really like the songs that she's singing.  I really like the songs that she's singing that I haven't heard before.  She's singing more and more different songs.  I feel like this album is going to be a hit.  I know that she's going to be a huge hit and I'm really excited for it.  I would really like to see her singing on the radio and on the TV.  I think she's going to be a huge success.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I received my CD in July of 1998.  I am a Christian,  so I am a firm believer in the fact that I just bought a CD on another company's website.  I have to say I was a little disappointed by the songs.  That being said I have only listened to a few songs so far.

Amazon review: I ordered this CD from Amazon,  thinking it was a one time  purchase only to find out two weeks later that it was a "special  edition".  I ordered the song 'What You Know' and not only did it come in an extra package with other songs, it came with an additional  CD with a bonus disc of songs that are not included on the original CD.  Also I received a phone call from Amazon the next day to confirm that I ordered the extra package.  I am trying to figure out what was wrong with the original order.  I am not much for listening to music but I was excited to hear this guy sing.  I am just disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I thought this album was great.  It was not until I listened to the bonus CD that I realized that I needed to add the songs on the bonus CD  so I added those songs and now I can still listen to the songs on the bonus CD.  I thought the songs were pretty and the lyrics were good.  I purchased this album on a whim two weeks ago.  I am very disappointed with the album and wish I had not given this album a try.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I received this CD as a free CD from my employer.  I like it alot.  It's a good CD for background music and the only one with no language in it.  The vocalists are all very good.  I also like the different styles of music.  I'm planning on ordering another CD from Libera.  I'm glad I got this for Christmas.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The music is very good, and I'm not a fan of it.  The songs are very repetitive, and the music is very boring.  It's better to just listen to the artists who actually like the music, such as Amy Grant, Michael Franks, or even the one artist who has made it big and famous, such as Elton John.  I have to say, and I'm sorry to say this, that it's very annoying when you have to listen to this music every day for work.  It's better to listen to people who actually like the music, because it's really boring to listen to this stuff ALL DAY.

Amazon review: I wasn't sure what to expect from this album, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's the first time I've heard Christian music, and it comes across quite unique and different.  It's not mainstream Christian music, but instead has a really unique sound and feel.  I love it and am glad that I bought this album for my family.  The songs are all very diverse and I think some of them are a little too close to each other, but that's just me.

Amazon review: I have some serious trouble with my music-listening experience.  I have been trying to listen to Christian music for many years and I keep running into the fact that I like a lot of the music but never seem to have the time to listen to it.  This CD has been very helpful in getting me started again.  I really have to give a lot of credit to the singer/songwriters of this CD for helping me get back into listening to Christian music.  As I listened to this CD I realized that there is so much that I like in the music.  I've had some problems with understanding some of the lyrics, and that's really not my fault.  Also, I have to admit that I like the music better when I'm not having to listen to it every day.  I mean, I just don't have the time for all of it, and I know it's a lot of time.  I think that this CD will be really helpful in getting me to listen to it more often.
Sentiment: Neutral

Amazon review: I like this album very much.  I'm a Christian, and it's been a while since I've heard Christian music.

I would like to hear more Christian music in the future.

I'm glad I bought it because it wasn't on the shelf, and I had to look it up for the first time. That was the best thing that ever happened to me. This album is such a great album for your kids to listen to. It's not too heavy, it's not too light, and it's not too boring. This album has so many different songs that I love. It's so much fun to listen to. I love the songs that have a little bit of energy to them. I'm not usually a fan of slow songs, but I really like this album and I love it. This album is something that I plan on using in my children's school. I'm a fan of the album, and I love it. Sentiment: Positive

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.
