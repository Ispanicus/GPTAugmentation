Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Amazon review: I am not a huge Pink fan but this song is great. I love the song but after watching the "Pleasure Principle" video I realized that it wasn't nearly as good as the other songs on the album. The lyrics are great, but the music is just plain crap. I would give this a 5/10 but I have my doubts as to whether the music is worth paying for.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

I am impressed by the remastered version, and I guess its going to be the original pressing that is going to be the best. I couldnt be happier with this release. The best of a great band.

I can't remember the show but the next thing I know my dad took us to the front of the stage, we were screaming with excitement. I can't even remember the first song but I remember the band. I remember them playing the classic "Worship". I was in my teens when I saw them. It all started when my parents went to see them at the Hammersmith Odeon in the early 80s. They bought the album "The Final Frontier" and I didn't believe

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review:  I liked this song.  It seems like it could have been made by a different artist.  As someone who has a collection of rap songs I like, this one really impressed me.  It definitely has a different feel to the others I have heard.  I don't know if it's just a coincidence or what, but the song has a great beat to it, and I definitely like the lyrical content.  The only thing that I don't like is that this song was released by a company called "Dirty Hit".  I don't know if they are trying to cash in on the popularity of hip-hop or what, but I think it's pretty unfair.  I could care less what happened to them. As far as the music industry goes, I'm glad that they were able to make a living off of music.  I guess it's bad business if you are a company that works solely off of music, but I'm not complaining.  I mean, I'm a college student, and I could probably do better financially working for a company like this, but I would never try to profit off of it.  There are many of us out there that could do better financially working for companies like this.  We could make more money, and if you have a hard time making money, then you are probably not doing the right thing.  There are many that could do better working for companies like this, and I for one, am glad that we are able to.  I would hope that if any of my friends or family would try to make music, they would do so for a company that helps make a living off of music, not a company that profits off of it.  I hope that if my friends and family would ever try to make music that they would do it for a company that doesn't try to profit off of it.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of the New York Dolls.  I love the sound of Jim Carroll's guitar and the bass line of Billy Murcia.  The song "Just Like Heaven" was a big hit in the late 60s and 70s.  The song was a little more uptempo, and a little more uptempo version was used as the B-Side of the single.  I think the song is a little too over the top, but that's the charm of it.  It reminds me of how cool the Dolls were during their period.  I like the version on the album The Dolls Are Back.  I like the song on the album and the B-Side of the single on this CD.

Amazon review: When I was 16 I started going to a place called The Black Cat on the corner of West 10th & Main Street.  That's where the Grateful Dead played for years, and also where the Jefferson Airplane played, and where the Incredible String Band played.  And, oh yeah, the Black Cat was the place where the MC5 played.  I was born in the early 80s, and I'm a lifelong Deadhead.  I heard the Dead play in the Black Cat many times, and we would go to the Black Cat, and we would play games, and you could feel the vibe in the building, even at a distance.  The Dead would get great feedback, as opposed to most rock bands, who would get a little feedback at the start of their set.  The Dead played at the Black Cat for 10 years straight.  I remember the last time they played at the Black Cat, there was huge security at the door.  They said that they were coming to take everybody out, and we weren't going anywhere! I thought they were joking, but they were serious.  They came in and they took everyone out, and we never saw them again.  That was the last time I saw the Dead.  I've never seen them since.  I'm just sayin'.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think I've been a fan of the Grateful Dead since the early 70s, when I saw them at the Fillmore East.  I was about 8 or 9 at that time, and never was I disappointed with their music.  I just love their music, and it's just as good as I remember.

Amazon review: This is the third CD in a series of 4 CDs by the Grateful Dead.  The band has put out another 3 CDs on this label.  They have always been my favorite band.  My first album was probably the best, and I am the only person I know in my family who owns a copy.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is what I wanted from the first album.  I needed a more rock and roll feel for the first album.  I wanted a little more rock and roll, a little more blues, a little more soul, if you will.  This is more of a rock and roll band, and I think they could have gone into a little more of a soul/R&B direction, which would have been the right direction for this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I guess The Grateful Dead were one of the bands I started listening to as a kid.  I love the music of the Dead, and I love the songs, but there are some songs on here which I find very corny.  I guess I'll have to go back to the original album for all of their songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I grew in the 60s and 70s.  I've been a huge Grateful Dead fan since I was a kid.  I'm not a "real" musician, and I don't have any formal knowledge of music, so I'm sure there are mistakes, but I'm sure there are some that are deliberate.  I don't know what it is, but there are some songs on this CD that have an "off" quality, and I think they were done on purpose.  I know there are mistakes on this CD, and I know that not every song is perfect.  I've never been the best at listening to music, as I've never had a way to really listen to music, so I can't judge

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my son on a lark.  He is a huge fan of Billy Joel.  The download and stream was not easy.  The download went thru multiple servers and had a lot of buffering.  There was a lot of background noise.  Once it finally finished it then you were downloading the whole disc.  I had to play it until it quit, but it was not easy.  After 4 hours of download time I finally finished.  The whole disc was good.  My son liked it.  I wish I had purchased the CD as an mp3 download.  The song selection is great.  I could have listened to it on Spotify.  I will purchase this CD for my son.

Amazon review: I purchased this disc for my son to listen to as a gift for his birthday.  I purchased 3 copies.  When I got it I found that while it had a good quality sound, it had some sort of glitch with the streaming and I could not get the whole disc.  I thought to buy another copy, but I could not find the CD in my box and in my car.  So I bought the digital download.  I was able to listen to all the songs.  I will definitely buy this CD again for my son.  He really enjoyed it.
Sentiment: Positive

I will purchase the digital download.  I love Billy Joel and will listen to it again.  I love his music and this really is a great CD!

The best thing about your music

The best thing about your music is the quality of the sound and the music you have on it. I would like to recommend that you consider selling your CDs and start streaming them to make some extra money. They make a lot of money and I think that's the best way to make some money and also to support your music. I don't see why you would not sell them since you are getting it for free. I would suggest you look at what other people have been doing and try to copy them. You can even contact them on Facebook and ask them if they would buy the songs. They may be willing to buy the songs. That's what I did with one of my friends and he is very happy with all the money he made.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I purchased this CD because my ex-boyfriend had written a song about how much he loves me.  I love Jim Gaffigan and his music.  I'm glad they made this CD.  I'm sorry this CD has a parental advisory sticker on it.  It should be removed!  I will be sending it back immediately.

Amazon review: This album is full of great songs - a good album for a rainy day.  Unfortunately, this album has a bunch of pop songs.  These songs are okay, but they are not great.  I would not buy another album by these artists because I would not buy another album like this again.

Amazon review: I didn't know what to expect when I bought this band's CD.  I was not happy when I first listened to it.  However, i now enjoy it a lot.  It is hard to listen to some songs at the same time.  The song "Lullaby" is the most depressing song ever.  The lyrics are okay.  They are okay at least.  They do not have a single good song in here.  I will never buy them again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have been listening to this group for years and years.  I own one CD and I love it.  However, I don't know where they will go from here.  They are stuck in the 70's and need to move on to another genre.  I don't know what to say about them.  I don't recommend they should be listened to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I own all the albums by this band, and I have listened to them all.  The songs are good and some of them are really good.  One song however is terrible.  Just awful.  It is annoying.  I don't know why they play the same songs over and over.  They should try something new.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was listening to the song "Ain't No God" and I was thinking how great it was and then it went into a part that made me think to myself how stupid it was and I don't know how this song got on my list to review.  I also don't know where it made it on my list.  The song is really good and it is about as good as the other songs
