Amazon review: For one, it was the short verision or "radio" version. Also, they gave the impression that it was un-edited but it was, not that the content was all that "adult" or vulgar. I was very disappointed if they are going to put a warning label for content they should also put a warning label for edited content.

Amazon review: I downloaded this MP3 after hearing it in an AT & T commercial. I like the song, but the MP3 sounds absolutely awful. It's just way too compressed. So it's extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range. Almost unlistenable.  I honestly don't think you can blame a lot of this on the MP3 encoding. 256 k is a perfectly respectable bit rate, and I have plenty of MP3s that sound fine with lesser bit rates.

Amazon review: I have to agree. This is the music to listen to when you're bored. The music is so different than anything else on the radio and if you're into bluegrass, or really have any ear, it's worth listening to! I have to say I don't like them live, but I do like this CD.

Amazon review: I'm really glad I bought this CD because it takes me back to what I like. This is the sound of the old Z-Boys. It sounds very familiar to me. I remember when they played our band's music on the radio station. I can't believe that I'm back in the same time zone and listening to the same music. This band is very good, and I enjoy Z-Boys music.

This is the first album by the Z-Boys. These guys are from Michigan, and are a country band who play bluegrass. They had three albums released, and they were all great. You can still buy them: http://z-boys.com/

The Z-Boys are from Michigan, and they play bluegrass. They have three albums released, and I think all of them are great. You can still buy them: http://z-boys. com/

The Z-Boys have three albums out on CD: Z-Boys the Heart, Z-Boys the Heart 2nd Edition, and Z-Boys the Heart 3rd Edition. Z-Boys the Heart 2nd Edition is a remastered version of the first album of the Z-Boys. The most recent release was Z-Boys the Heart 3rd Edition.

The Z-Boys have three albums out on CD:

Z-Boys the Heart

Z-Boys the Heart 2nd Edition

Z-Boys the Heart 3rd Edition

These are the Z-Boys' original albums. They are all good, and I think they should be bought by everyone.

This is the first album by the Z-Boys, and it is great. The songs are different and original, and the band is very good, unlike most blues band. I have been a fan of the Z-Boys since the first album. They should be bought by everyone.

This is the first album by these guys. I'm glad I bought this one. I have never heard anything like this before. If you like bluegrass, this is the CD to buy.

This is the first album by the Z-Boys that I have heard. They are different and original, and I'm glad I bought this one.

This is the first album by the Z-Boys I have heard. I don't know if it was their first album or if I just haven't heard it yet, but this is a great release. I love the first track, "Goin' Down", and the rest of the songs are great, and very different.

This is a great album by the Z-Boys. "Goin Down" is a good song, but the other tracks are not that great. I would recommend buying all three albums: Goin Down, Goin' Down 2nd Edition, and Goin Down 3rd Edition.

This is a great album by the Z-Boys, and I have been listening to the "Goin Down" CD a lot all week. I like the last track, "I'm a King" very much, and the others are a little too much for me at first. I do like the song, "I'm a King" a lot, but the rest of the songs are not that great.

This is a great album by the Z-Boys that I am sure everyone will enjoy. If you like bluegrass, this is the CD to buy. I have heard many great albums, but this is the best.

This is the first album by the Z-Boys and it is excellent. I think this is a very good one, and I have been listening to it a lot.

Amazon review: Man I hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed. The hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by Jackyl. That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.  There is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating. Nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of Jackyls 'best of'.

Amazon review: I saw Paul Simon live 2 days before this album came out. Usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff, you generally don't want to hear it, you wanna hear the hits. This was a special case. He played about 5 or 6 songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more. I was blown away. He talks about how he spent some time in the Amazon, going on a spiritual journey, drinking this "root tea" which turned out to be ayahuasca, and seeing spirits.

Amazon review: This is a pirated recording from a mono copy of the LP.  It is complete with tics and pops.  The sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo parts of the recording.  I thought I was getting a good copy from the original master tapes and was very disgusted with the sound.  My worn cassette copy was much better.  I would give it a zero for the rating if I could.  The performance is wonderful and exciting, but badly mangled by the transfer.  Do not buy this under any circumstances.

Amazon review: I had listened to Paul Simon since I was a child and I was always a fan!  When I heard the news that it was going to be a Paul Simon album, I was so excited.  I love the song "The Way We Were" and I thought it was going to be an awesome album.  I'm glad I was wrong. I bought the set in a two day period and I have been disappointed ever since.  I bought the album on an impulse and after 2 days of playing it I was thoroughly confused.  I have never had so many problems with an album I've ever bought.  I have not listened to this album since.  I am very disappointed.  I will not buy it again.  I do not know if I will listen to any more Paul Simon albums.  I do not understand the concept of the album.  I am sorry I was not able to listen to this album. I am not a fan of Paul Simon.  This is the only reason I purchased the album.  I am not sure if I will listen to any more songs from this album.  I will not buy it again.  I will listen to this album as much as I did this one.  I listened to this album for two days and I have listened to this album for seven years.  I hope I am wrong and the album will be a good one.  I am disappointed.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album.  I think it's better than most of his other albums.  I really enjoyed the stories.  I was a little disappointed that I didn't like any of the songs on it.  I thought "The Way We Were" might have been a good song but it wasn't my favorite song.  I've heard it before but I never knew how it was done.  I liked the other songs on the album.  I like the way he talks to the audience.  He doesn't talk down to them.  I liked his stories.  I liked the songs.  I think he did something right after this album.  I do think he should get back together with Elton John.  I think he should do more albums like this.  I've always liked Paul Simon so I think I'm going to buy the next album in the series.  I think he's talented.  I would like to see more of him.  The album is a little boring for me.  I like the songs but I don't like the whole story.  I don't find the songs very interesting.  I didn't like the album at all.  I don't even remember listening to this album so it's hard for me to give an accurate review.  I will not buy the next Paul Simon album.  I'm sorry I bought this album.  I will not buy another Paul Simon album.  I can't believe it.  I hope I'm wrong.  My wife says I'm the world's biggest idiot.  I just bought this album and I don't like it.  I don't think it's a good album.  I liked the stories.  I always liked the songs.  I'm not sure what happened to my expectations.  It's a little weird.  I think it was a good album but it's not my favorite one of his.  I thought it was better than most of his other albums.  I liked most of the songs on it but I didn't like the one I liked best.  I'm not sure I should like it.  I would not buy it again.  I don't think the album was a good one.  I don't know why he got back together with Elton John.  I think Elton John should really produce more of Paul Simon albums.  I love the songs.  I love the stories and he's a great story teller.  I don't think he's a great singer.  I don't think he's a great story teller.  I don't like the songs or stories.  I don't think he's talented.  I don't think he's a great singer or story teller.  I don't like the songs or the stories.  I don't think he's creative.  I don't like him.  I think he's a jerk.  I don't like his singing voice.  I don't like the stories.  I don't think he's a great singer or story tellers.  I don't like his songs.  I don't like his stories or songs.  I don't like him.  I don't care.  I don't like his music.  I don't like his stories and songs.  I don't like the way he talks.

Can't get in to this pop deluxe stuff. Some of the rave reviews puzzle me. This cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it. Not trying to say Jewel should stay confined but, just because record sales are "lagging" a bit, does that mean an artist has to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything Jewel seemed to want to tell us to rise above?

Amazon review: This more acoustic sound really suits Haynes, and is the best I've ever heard him do on his own. Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential.

"I Still Believe" is repeated twice more, and then the band plays "Shelter" for a minute and a half.  This is repeated four more times, and then the band stops playing "I Still Believe" and plays "Shelter" for a minute and a half.  The band plays "I Still Believe" for a total of fourteen times, before playing "Shelter" again.  This is repeated four more times before the album is over.

Amazon review: I was really excited to get this CD as I already had had a copy but lost it a long time ago and wanted to replace it. It arrived soon enough, however when I listened to it hardly any of the songs listed on the back are actually on the CD. This is really disappointing. I don't know if it is a manufacturing error but its really a shame that they didn't check it. The songs aren't as good as the original list on the disc and it is also very poor quality to  have one track list on the CD and another on the CD cover.

Amazon review: It's definitely a crying shame that these guys have been together for so little time. This Paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz, post-bop and avant-garde. By listening to it you can find out why Chick Corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60's and why Dave Holland was and still is one of the most important bass players in the world. Barry Altschul is superb as well and yes, Anthony Braxton is not as comfy in playing standards as his bandmates but he fits here great anyway.

Amazon review: I'll make this brief as usual. Tha Animatrix DVD is what turned me onto Anime, it's also a slight bit disturbing, but you know as well as I do that us 21st Century Humans need to be disturbed once in a while. I always loved the music from the DVD, so decided, why not get the soundtrack? And I did. What I didn't expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie (in musical terms).

Amazon review: Evidently the title "Simple Plan" refers to a theory that if you rip off another band's hits, you will sell more records. I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, "Time To Say Goodbye." It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block.

Amazon review: The tunes were McCartney, the stack on each disc seemed awkward.  Excluding disc 1, there were songs included that were to be honest pure junk.  Tunes I had never heard and they were poor representatives of the career.  I guess it's a bit like any other McCartney disc, you're lucky if you 5 out of ten that make sense.

Amazon review: This is an interesting song.  I think he just threw the verse in the middle of the song because he didn't know what direction it was going in.  It doesn't flow very well.  I think it was written to fit the music or just for some reason, he just decided to put the verse in.

Amazon review: A great song.  I didn't recognize it at first but once I did I loved it.  I think he wrote this and recorded it for the first time.  I am not sure if it was because it was their first or just because it was so good.  It's a really good song.

Amazon review: Country continues to turn out songs with lyrics that other formats just can't hope to approach.

Amazon review: I'm very impressed with the quality of these.  They have nice quality, and are well made.  The only criticism I have is they are not very thin.  I am not sure if it is just my computer, but they seem to be less than 1/8" thick.  If so, they could be thicker.  I have been using them for about a week and have not noticed that they are less than 1/8" thick, but I have other thin karaoke microphones and do not notice this quality.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Very nice quality.  I wish they sold them in rolls for easy use.  I wish they would make them in the same size as the ones for the cello.  They would be great for a solo instrument and a cello.  They would be great for a brass instrument or a string instrument.  They would also be great for a trumpet.  They are big enough to hold a cello comfortably.  They are made in the U.S.A.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I like the sound quality and the quality of the microphones.  The price was a little steep though, but if you want a quality microphone, and don't mind spending a little more, these are worth it.  I will be buying more from Amazon.com.  I like the feel of them, and they seem to really do the job at sound quality.  I am not sure I would buy these again though, but some of the other ones I have are like $30.00, and I am almost certain they would be even better.  I have tried one of these.  I just don't feel that the quality of the sound is that high.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The sound quality is good, and the mic's are very high grade, but I can't get the sound level to stay in the middle at all times.  I can get a decent sound level, but the volume keeps fluctuating, and to get the volume to stay in the middle, you have to put the mic out too far.  I would rather have a mic that does not fluctuate volume, and is more consistent in the volume level.  I can't seem to get the volume to stay in the middle.  I would like to have a better mic that does not fluctuate volume and sound level.  I am not sure if that is my computer or the way these mics are made, but I am getting constant fluctuation in the volume level.  Also, the volume level is pretty low.  It isn't clear whether the sound level is high or low.  I am not sure if it is the quality of the mics or my computer.  I would recommend them to other people, but I can't recommend them to myself.  I would definitely not buy them again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I LOVE LOVE LOVE the sound of these mics. I have two of them and use them on piano, mandolin, and guitar.  They are very helpful in getting sound that is nice and clear when you can't get a good enough sound from the built-in mic.  I love the flexibility of these mics, as I can use them to get great sounding sound from any instrument. The first time I used these mics, I had a very hard time getting a good enough sound for the guitar.  I used an electric guitar and a microphone from the same company and ended up using the built-in mic on the guitar, and the other one I used on this keyboard.  I also had a hard time getting a good enough sound on the mandolin.  With the built-in mic, I was able to get a very good sound on the mandolin, but I would have to use the other mic on the guitar and then use the built-in mic on the mandolin to get good sound.  I would like to purchase more of these mics, however I think these are a little too small for me to carry around with me for performance.  They are about the size of a cello, but have a larger mic.  I would not recommend these mics to other musicians.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Good quality, very clear recordings, and the sound is awesome.  I had a couple of issues with the sound on my first order, but I have been told that it is because I didn't clean the microphone well.  I don't think the sound quality is as good as with the first order.  I have a better microphone, and I will be ordering some more.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: When I first heard this song I thought for sure that it was an old school throwback. Robin Thicke, Pharrell and T.I. definitly hit the nail on the head with one. It reminded me of something you'd hear from Earth, Wind and Fire. I hope these three collaborate again.

Amazon review: The First Cut Is the Deepest" is a 1967 song written by Cat Stevens, originally released by P. P. Arnold in May 1967. Stevens' own version originally appeared on his album New Masters in December 1967. This one is OK, but CAt's version is the best.

Amazon review: I am a huge Floyd fan.  I love everything since Dark Side, and much from before Dark Side.  I love post-Waters Floyd, Floyd with Roger Waters, and  I love a lot of the solo songs from Waters, from Gilmour, and from Wright.  I didn't enjoy this album.  I heard it once through and that was enough.  I don't think it's a money grab, it just sucks.  Edit: perhaps Floyd, or at least those that remain, deserve an album retrospect, in whatever way they desire.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  After listening to this album for the first time you might not notice it is a Pink Floyd album, and not a solo Floyd album, it seems to have a Pink Floyd feel.  Pink Floyd have always been known for their progressive music.  However, the music on this album is not very progressive, and is not progressive in the way it should be.  This album is more of a rock album than a progressive album.  The guitars are too loud, the drums are too fast, the vocals are too loud, the keyboards are too busy, so it is hard to tell what the music is actually about.  However, I did enjoy the music that Pink Floyd put out on the rest of their career.  I still think that I prefer the music from before Dark Side, to the music that came later.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I love this song, it's catchy and funny, and not so much of a "song".  I also have a strong preference for the version by Pink Floyd, from Dark Side of the Moon.  I don't know why I liked this one so much, though.

Amazon review:  I just can't get over the fact that I've never heard of this band before.  This is a song of such pure joy and joyousness that I simply can't believe that I've never heard of this group.  It's like finding out that you don't know the Beatles, and there's a band out of England called The Beatles, and they've been around for 60 years.  I love this song, and I still love this song.

Amazon review:  This was the first album that I bought on line.  I remember being so excited when I saw that there was a new Pink Floyd album, and I was hoping that I would like it.  I was not disappointed.  It's a very mellow and easy to listen to album.  I like the songs on this album but I really like the songs on Dark Side of the Moon.  I like the songs on Wish You Were Here, so I will give this one a five stars.

Amazon review:  This song is pretty good.  I just love the way the music flows.  I like the song, and the vocals are really good.  I'm not sure where they took the vocals from, but the song is pretty good.  The guitar solos are a little bit annoying, but I don't really mind them.  There is a bit of a guitar solo in the middle of the song, but it's not the worst guitar solo in the world.  I also like the song, but I think that it's not that great of a song.  I think that the song would be better if it had a few more chords in the beginning and the end.  I also like the song, but I don't really like the song.

Amazon review:"I'm Not in Love" is a song by American rock band Pink Floyd, written by Roger Waters and David Gilmour. The song was first recorded for Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and released as a single in March 1974. The single failed to chart, and thus was only included on the 2007 Pink Floyd box set released by EMI. Waters' vocals are heard on this track, but Gilmour's vocals are on the rest of the songs.

Amazon review: I got this shirt at a sale price. I really like the way the shirt stretches. It is comfortable. There are a ton of colors to choose and the shirt is not too tight or too loose. And it is very light weight and not too heavy. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it does not have a chest pocket. I would like to know if it is going to be made into a sweater.

Amazon review: I got a blue one at the sale price. It is a little tight around the neck and chest but I will get used to it. The white one was a little too tight around the neck and it is very long. I haven't worn it yet but will probably get some use out of it.

Amazon review: I ordered this shirt online from Amazon.com to a local store. I received it in two days. I am very satisfied with the shirt.

Amazon review: I've followed Planetshakers for several years now and I own all of their albums. I've never been a big fan of their songwriting. When compared to songwriters like Daniel Bashta, Hillsong, Brian Johnson, David Crowder, Jeremy Riddle and similar artists, PS lyrics always seem elementary. like very surface level. They just make words rhyme and repeat phrases rather than dig deep for words that convey real meaning. But what they lacked in songwriting, they always MORE than compensated for in musicianship.

Amazon review: I absolutely love this album. I love the fact that they still have so much energy left in their songs. There are times when I think that the songs are a little too slow, but that is a minor complaint.

A:

The problem with your proposed solution is that the music and lyrics do not match (in the song lyrics it should be "If you were with me" and "If you had been with me" as it is).
The song lyrics for the first song are:

If you were with me
If you were with me
If you were with me
If I had been with me
If I had been with me

Amazon review: It's unfortunate that there isn't a negative rating scale. The disc took five weeks to arrive. Both the sound quality and the renditions of the songs were abysmal, even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging. Recycled the day it arrived.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: No banjo. I was simply disappointed by the overall sound. I loved Mumford's first album, and thought the second one was just as good if not better. I was very excited to receive this CD the first day it came out, but after listening to it three times end to end, I felt bored. After the first week, I accidentally left it in the CD player of my rental car when I returned it, and made no effort to retrieve it. I hold out hope that the group makes a 4th album and moves back toward the sound that made the original two CDs so terrific.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: My favorite is the one with all the drum fills, all the stuff that makes the song feel like it's going out live and I love the drumming. I really love that one. I'm glad I am not the only one who feels this way. I also love that song.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: All of the songs are great. However, the band is really starting to suffer from the same problem as the rest of the music world: they are overproduced. The vocals are bland. The music is too loud and repetitive. I'm glad I'm not a member of the band anymore.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am very excited to hear this band again. I remember when they were called Motown. Their music was my all time favorite. I haven't been able to listen to them for many years. Hopefully I can get into them again. I was very disappointed with this CD. The song, "You Really Got Me," was my least favorite. The CD was a little short.

Amazon review: I have bought Music through Amazon preferring them to iTunes because because iTunes try to control their music too much. However after the latest MP3 purchase,  I find it now Amazon has made it as difficult as possible to download their music to my iTunes. Bye-bye Amazon.

Amazon review: Absolutely horrible pressing. Save your money and just go with the 2016 remaster. I got this on a daily deal, but even at that price, it wasn't worth it. Sounds distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range. The bass is nonexistent, and was quieter than most of my other records. I've listened to it about 3 times now, just to see if it needed to break in a bit. Nope! Just horrible.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Overall a great album, but I can't say it's among my favorites. The only reason I can say it's a favorite is because the album has a distinct feel of its own. The band seems to have created an album that is a tribute to the music of the genre. The band has clearly put a lot of effort into the music, and that's what makes me want to listen to this. I don't know why there isn't a mix of the original members. If there was a mix, I could hear the original songs better, which would be one of the reasons I love this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great album, as they say. I purchased this after the release of the new album and even though I loved it, I don't plan on buying another.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really enjoyed the album. Loved the fiddle and banjo tunes. I really enjoyed the album, the song "Mary Wells" is a good example of that. I also liked the opening song "Carry Me Back" and "Levi". The songs I didn't like were the ones that sounded repetitive. I would have preferred the slower songs but I guess that is the charm of the album.

Amazon review: This is a great album and I'd have to give it 10 stars if I could. It seems that this album is a tribute to the music of the blues. The songs are all excellent, and the album has a great mix of different songs. I just wish that there was a little more variety from song to song.
