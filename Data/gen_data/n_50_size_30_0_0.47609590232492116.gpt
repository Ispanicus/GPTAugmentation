Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: this is a good one but I wish they would have at least cut the fat.  The songs are not as good as the first album.  I mean the song on the first one "Lets Party In The Sun" is awesome and the song on this one "It's A Trap" is a good one but no one is gonna be into that song.

Amazon review: I wasn't expecting this album to be such a great album but I am glad it was.  I would listen to it all the time.  This album is very good.  I like it a lot.  I love the way that they have incorporated the old school style of singing and the new school style of songs.  I like that they have made the song selection more random.  This album is very good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought this album was a lot of fun to listen to.  A lot of classic rock and roll mixed in with the usual rap and new school lyrics.  It seems like it was made for kids but it is still a damn good cd.  I really enjoyed the songs on this album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am not a huge rap fan and this album is not my favorite rap album but it is a good one.  They seem to have a lot of talent and have some great material on this album.  It was one of the first rap albums that I bought and I am glad I did.

Amazon review: I would say this is a very good album, but I would probably say it was a good album.  The album is very good for what it is.  One of my favorites of their entire discography.  I think the album could have been better if there was more variety in the album and the songs could have been a little more original.  It doesn't really bring anything new to the table for me.  I'm not a huge fan of rap but I do like this album.  It is a good album.

Amazon review: This is one of the best rap albums by this group.  It is so good that you will be able to listen to it all the time.  The songs are very good, but the album is also very good.  The song on the first album "The Only Way" is a good one and the songs on this one "It's a Trap" and "Lets Party In the Sun" are very good.  The song on the second album "This Is How We Roll" is very good, but the songs on the first album are very good.  The album is very good.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

Amazon review: I am looking forward to her new album. I don't know, it's just not for me. I love this woman, but I have no idea why I didn't like this album.  Not too sure why the album is over. I just don't have an opinion on it.

Amazon review: I love this CD. I know I have stated before that I don't like Meghan Trainor...but  I don't  like this CD. This isn't her best work yet, but it is good.  I do like the sound of this album, but I do not like it as much as I did the last one...her first CD, "Don't Tell Me" I did not like it.  I will most likely buy the second CD.  I think she has improved for whatever reason. I don't know, I think she is just a better writer.  This CD is actually good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's the first CD I have ever listened to by Meghan Trainor, and I enjoyed it.  I think the album is pretty good and I will be buying the second CD.  I think that she has improved since her first release. I agree with other reviews, this album is a little too much for me. The first album was good but the second album was better.  I like how the CD is all one piece and I have to flip the record to listen to the CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have to say that I was very disappointed in the two albums by Meghan Trainor.  I was hoping her songwriting would improve, but the songs didn't.  I did like "Don't Tell Me" and "Circles", but I prefer "Circles" over "Don't Tell Me".  The songs are not her best work, but I still enjoyed the album.  I think her songwriting has improved since her first two albums.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Meghan Trainor.  However, this album does not do much for me. The songs are not her best work, and the album is not as good as her second CD, "Don't Tell Me". I am hoping to have a third CD from Meghan Trainor.

I have listened to her first CD, "Don't Tell Me", and I thought it was good.  The songs weren't her best work, and I think it should have been her first album.

Amazon review: I think this CD is great.  I have listened to this CD many times.  My opinion on the CD is that it is better than the two previous albums.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

I really like this CD.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I was surprised to learn that he was going to leave the recordings to the public.  It made the album even better.  It was a good mix of both acoustic and electronic music.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I was skeptical at first because my family's members did not know who Gary Moore was, they thought he was a pop singer.  After listening to this album, I learned that he is a very good singer and musician and I am glad I decided to listen to this album.    The album is pretty much on par with all his other albums.  His music has never been boring and there is never a dull moment.  I love the fact that he has released many CDs and this is his first solo album.  I know that he will continue to release CDs and I will continue to purchase them as long as they are well researched and well produced.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of r. Kelly and this CD is a collection of his greatest hits. Most of the songs are about love, and of course, sex. The album title is a little misleading, as it is actually a collection of different styles of love songs, from ballads to rock to folk.

Amazon review: I love this CD! I've bought a few r. Kelly CD's and have enjoyed them. This is my fave r. Kelly album. The tracks are really good, and the ballads, if you will, are better than the rock-ballads he has written in the past. I really like the fact that he has chosen songs that are not about being a "hard body". I love the fact that a lot of the songs are about love. I think of all Kelly's songs, this one is the best. It is about love, and I think he has a lot of great songs on this CD. If you want a new CD, I'd recommend this one.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

If you like old time fiddle, old time string band, old time string quartet, old time string guitar, old time fife and drum band, old time jazz,  and old time country, you will like Dallas Holm.           Dallas Holm has a band that is as good as the old time musicians that played when I was a little boy.              You will like Dallas Holm a lot.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

I am not a big fan of country singing, but I have to say that there were a variety of great songs on this album. I liked the whole album except for the lyrics and the singing. The lyrics were not that good. The singing was ok, but not great. I guess that the lyrics were not that great. I am not a big fan of country singing and I do not think that this album will be a hit.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
