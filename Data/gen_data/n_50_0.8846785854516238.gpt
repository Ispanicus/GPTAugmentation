Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was having a bad day.  I had an exam the next day I couldn't miss, and my mom was on her way down from Maine for a visit.  I started the album, and just as I was about to start listening to the first song, my phone rang.  My mom's phone rang again.  So I picked up the phone and listened to the voicemail.  My mom had told her to call me if she needed anything, and my mom is always telling her to call if she needs anything. So I listened to the voicemail again.  The second time, I thought "I'm not going to get this CD.  It's not worth the money".  So then I thought, "What am I going to do if I don't get it?"  And I thought that maybe she was on her way home from Maine, and just needed to call me to let me know she was on her way home.  So then I thought, "I'll just listen to the voicemail again".  It's not as though I'll get the CD, but I'll get more use out of it.  So I listened to the voicemail again, and thought to myself, "Boy, I bet this is a great album".  And it is.  I really love this album.  It is a really great album.  I just wish it was on CD 2.  That's about all I have to say about this album.  It is a really great album.

They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

He said 'oh I have no idea what they are.'  I told him I was looking for a group and he said 'how many songs you want to hear?'  I said 5 and he took the CD out of my shopping cart and said 'ok, I have no idea what you want to hear.'  He said 'well you'll have to buy everything you want to hear.'

Amazon review: I love this album.  I didn't think this album had much to offer, but I'm actually a bit disappointed in this album.  He was good enough for me while he was with AI, it was just a matter of time before he lost control.  It's hard when someone you have been with a while, who you think you love, becomes a completely different person.  It's like a drug, and you need to be able to deal with it, or you'll be the one who has to deal with it.  It's like getting kicked out of a group, and you have to find the people that you can be a part of and trust.  And I suppose I was a part of AI, I really wasn't a part of the AI at all, I was a part of Tiam.  But Tiam had just been kicked out of AI by his father, so they had just been kicked out of AI.  I'm just glad that people love him, because even though he has his issues, he's still really good looking, and I really just want to love him.  I don't know, I just feel like for me to have that kind of a relationship with a guy, I need to get a little bit of my own back.  I feel like he could be a really good guy, but that he doesn't know how to get back to the person that he was when he used to be at AI.  It's like he just needs some time to find himself.  I'm just so disappointed in that, I don't think that this album is worth the money.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I bought this cd for my husband, who is a musician, but I'm not.  I just got the cd and was a little excited when I saw the name "Vic & Bob" on the cover.  I have been trying to persuade him to buy the cd, but he just hasn't been able to get the point that the cd is an amazing cd that he hasn't had the opportunity to hear.  I bought it for him because he loved the song "The Green Green Grass", which he said he wanted to buy.  I was a little confused as to the reason for the cd, when I first got it, because I had never heard a song like "Green Green Grass" or had ever heard of this band.  After going to a few of the reviews, I finally understood why he bought the cd.  I was surprised at how many people were upset with it.  It sounds like someone was trying to copy something, but didn't quite get the concept.  I thought I knew this band, but I found out that I never did.  I have listened to the CD and am totally amazed at what a great cd it is.  I'm so glad I never got this cd for myself!

I thought about putting the cd back on the shelves and never buying it, but the reviews on this site said this cd was amazing and i was determined to try it.  I bought a case of the cd's and waited in line for about 10 minutes to get them.  I wanted to return them, because they didnt have the songs I wanted.  They had everything else, except the cd's I wanted.  When i got home, I found out that the cd's were gone.  I called the store and they said they had all 4 cd's i had ordered and they would call me.  i never called.  I am very angry that the cd's were taken.  I bought the cd's and they dont even have them.  I still have the cd's and the cd's are still on the shelves.  I would like to hear your opinions on this cd and the cd's of these bands.

Amazon review: Schubert is not a composer that inspires a lot of enthusiasm in me. I have found some of the music of Schubert to be very beautiful, and I think he might have been one of the greatest composers of all time, but most of the music I have been exposed to has not been that inspiring. That being said, I did not find this recording to be disappointing. It is not as good as the first one, but it is quite good.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the band since the 80s.  I think they are pretty good, except for some songs on this cd.  The songs on this cd are pretty good, but I would not call it my favorite.  I had to skip some songs because they were too similar to the songs on the cd I already had.  The song "All Is Lost" is pretty good, but the other songs didn't appeal to me.  I am glad I got this cd, but I won't be listening to it again.

Amazon review:[I]t's my first time listening to the album and I'm quite satisfied.  It's a good listen and I have to say this album is a good buy.  There isn't a bad song or a bad songwriter.  The album is filled with good music, which is why I like it.  I am not sure why some people are not happy with this cd.  I could understand not being happy with the songs, but why not the music?  The cd is good and has a good sound.  I would say it's worth it to buy this album.  I will buy it again and again.

Amazon review: I was going to buy this for my friend and I.  I really liked it.  It was not a good buy for me.  My friend kept complaining about it.  It wasn't a bad cd, but the music was not my cup of tea.  I got this one cause I felt that I "needed" to buy the cd.  I could have gotten a lot more songs, but I couldn't have gotten all of them.  I do not like the song "Heart in the Sky" because the song was played.  I do not know why the song was played.  I didn't like the song.  I didn't like one of the songs on the cd.  I didn't like the song "Heart" and the song "What's It Gonna Be".  I didn't like the songs.  I don't know why I liked them.  I don't like the cd, but I would not buy it again.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

I really love Kelly Clarkson!

Not a good album in the least bit.

I'm hoping that they release a deluxe version of the album with a few new songs.  ive been waiting for this album for quite a while.  i think its definitely worth it.

It's pretty cool to hear Madoxx use his own voice, it's just a nice unique sound to it.  I'm a fan of his music, and you should check this album out if you're a hip hop fan!

Amazon review: A good hip hop album.  It just needs an update in the song writing.  It's not that bad, but I wish the producers of the album would have put more effort into it.  I mean, their best is "What's My Name".  The song "I'm a Madman" is a pretty good song, the best so far.  The production is pretty good, the song "What's My Name" is catchy, but the beat is not that cool.  The song "Can't Believe" is a good song, but the beat is boring.  The song "What's My Name" is better, but the beat is not that great.  The song "I'm A Madman" is good, but the beat is boring.  The song "I'm a Madman" is better, but the beat is boring.  The song "Can't Believe" is boring, but the beat is good.  I'm a Madman is a good song.  The songs are good, but they just need to be more creative.  I'm a Madman is not a bad song, but the beat needs to be faster.  The beat needs to get boring, and the song needs to be more creative.  The song "What's My Name" needs to be more creative.  And for the song "I'm a Madman" to get more creative.  The song "What's My Name" needs to get more creative.  The song "I'm a Madman" needs to get more creative.  The song "I'm aMadman" needs to get more creative.  The song "Can't Believe" needs its original beat and lyrics.  And the song "What's My Name" needs to get more creative.  Overall, I'm a Madman is a good album, but it needs to be more creative.  It's very average.  I wish they would put more energy into their new songs!  The producers of the album should have put a lot more effort into

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I now listen to classical music daily. I feel like this is what classical music can be. It is beautiful and beautiful. It is timeless.

I don't know anything about Schubert but I do know this guy. I have been listening to this for a week. I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Schubert. It is the best album I have ever heard, period.

I have been a fan of classical music for as long as I can remember, and I am certainly not a Schubert fan, but I still enjoy this album. The piano pieces and string quartets are fantastic. The violin and cello sonatas are also very good.

I am a fan of Schubert as well and I have always enjoyed his music. However, this is the first time I have heard anything by him that I thought was quite enjoyable. If you like him, I suggest picking this up. If you don't like him, there is no reason to buy it.

I have been a fan of classical music for as long. That is, until I

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: "One more time" by Jewel from the CD "The Complete Jewel Box" (CD). I have read Amazon complaints on this song and it seems Jewel is trying to be a pop star and a folk singer at the same time. This song is on the CD "The Complete Jewel Box" (CD). It is a very good song with a great message. I've listened to Jewel's "One More Time" song at least 5 times and it is a great song. It's Jewel and not some other artist! What is wrong with her. Why did she change her whole style of singing and singing a song like this now. Can't sing the blues anymore....or can't sing any blues. I would rather listen to the blues and have a song like this as the last song on the CD. She should have stayed with her soul. Why did she leave her soul in the studio to be a pop star?

Her performance and vocals were not bad, but the song was overused.  I really wish she had not used the word "bitch" so much.  I was glad when I realized the lyrics were not hers, but I was turned off by her use of the word "bitch" and I thought maybe she was trying to be something she was not, and that really offended me.  I could hear what she was saying, but it was not what the song was saying.  I think a lot of people misunderstood her lyrics, and I think that is what offended me.

I like the fact that you can hear the singer in the music.  I like the fact that she talks to the person singing as well as the people to.  I would also like to add that she is beautiful when singing.  I think this CD is very good.  I guess I will have to listen to it more to determine if it is a keeper.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: If there was one thing I loved about this album, it was the album cover.    I must admit that with the cover art that I thought I was listening to a female vocalist.  The album has a lot of female vocalists on it, but there isn't a single one that I could relate to the material.    The album has a nice flow to it, but the entire album is too long, and too repetitive.    To top it off, the album is too long.  The album runs for over an hour, but there are only two songs that are over fifteen minutes long.    The album is very repetitive, but at least the songs have a nice flow to them.  To make it worse, the CD's quality is terrible, and the tape was very scratchy.    On top of that, the lyrics are horrible and the CD is almost impossible to listen to with the sound on.  Not worth the money!    If you are a fan of Hip Hop, then this is not the CD for you!    I believe that there are many other CD's out there with better songs, but I believe this to be the worst CD that I have heard in a very long time.    I hope that they don't release any more CD's from this artist.

The worst part about it is the fact that the producers have no clue what they are doing, and that is what really kills this album, the lack of production skills.    The album has a very good flow, the songs seem to flow, but the album runs all the way through and ends up being a total mess.    The lyrics are all over the place, they are very repetitive and have no flow.    This album is just a mess.    The album is just a big fat mess.  The worst part about it, is the fact that the producers have no clue what they are doing,  and that is what really kills this album, the lack of production skills,    The album is just a big fat mess.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have been a fan since I bought this album in the early 1990s.  I had the opportunity to see them live a few times and was amazed at the talent that they had.  Still, I wish I would have found this album years ago.  I would have been able to see them play and really hear how good they were.  I have been waiting for this album for about 10 years and am just ready to have the opportunity to hear this music in full.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the way this band sounds.  When I heard them in '97 I thought they were pretty talented.  I didn't think they would make it out of the introversion that most people on this planet (that I know) have.  They have been struggling to make it out of the introvert world for about 15 years, and I think it is time for them to get their act together.

Amazon review: This is my first time listening to this album, but I had never seen them live.  It is worth your time, no doubt.

Amazon review: I haven't been a fan of jam bands since the Beatles came out, but this band has me all warmed up.  The music is amazing.  The songs are so unique.

Amazon review: I have purchased the CD and I am enjoying every bit of the music.  All of the songs are excellent.  I have listened to several of them and several others.  I can say that I have thoroughly enjoyed the CD.  I have listened to the CD about 25 times now and I have enjoyed every bit of it.  The music is well arranged and the sound quality is excellent.  The lyrics of each song sound deep and profound.  I have enjoyed most of the songs.  The one song that has been the hardest for me to listen to is "The Call".  The lyrics to this song, "I was walking down the hallway, and I felt the call.  The words just don't seem to add up.  I really don't understand it.  Please explain to me what it means.  Is it really what it says?  Or is it just an expression that is used by people who don't understand what it means?"  I really don't understand this one.  I think it is a little strange to read in the lyrics.  I can't figure out what is so funny about the song.  I don't like the fact that it is a woman's name.  I think this guy should not have put his name on the song.  I think that it is a song that is meant for a male to sing.  The song is not meant for a woman to sing.  I think I will not purchase this CD.  I have tried to listen to the music on my CD player, but it just seems too fast and I can't understand the lyrics.  I really did not think that I would be able to enjoy the CD this much, I think that I have really enjoyed the CD.  The lyrics to the songs are very deep and I really felt that I was getting a good understanding of the meaning of the lyrics.  I really learned a little more about the Bible and God.  I think that I am going to purchase the rest of the CD and try to enjoy it as much as I do the first.  The songs seem to be more meaningful to me now.  The lyrics seem to be more meaningful to me now.  I liked the first CD.  The vocals of the singers are excellent.  I really like the fact that the singers are very professional.

I like to have the mp3 versions of your CDs because I like to have a cd to listen to while driving, and I also like to have the whole cd to listen to at one time to hear the songs in context of one another. I like the way you are able to have the cd's in your car so that you can listen to them while driving, and I like how you have the mp3 version of the songs, so I can listen to the songs individually. I also like the fact that I can download the mp3's at anytime, and then listen to them later when I'm not behind the wheel. This is my first cd purchase, and
