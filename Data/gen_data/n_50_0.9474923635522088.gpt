Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: "When you're in a deep slumber and you awaken, do not resist the temptation to call out to that night's party." It was the title of a song from the CD. I am a night owl.

Amazon review: This album is a new one from the "Tallis" Music Group. There are a few songs that I like and then there are some that I don't like. The songs I didn't like have to do with the word "titillate." I cannot even use that word in a song.

Amazon review: Great song! I feel like I hear what Eminem is saying to me. I have heard many of his songs and this is the first time that I have ever heard this song. I feel like I am in his mind and he is telling me what he is feeling about Eminem....he is telling me that he loves me.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album really isn't a good album. It is however, an album that is well produced, with some songs that are decent (I give it a 3 out of 5) and others that are really awful.  It is very clear from the beginning that this is a rap album and the majority of the songs are about rap.  The album also contains a few songs that I feel most of the people who can hear the songs would find to be good from a rap album (such as "Been There, Done That") however, the majority of the album is just rap songs. If you have a good ear you can probably get the gist of the songs without hearing the song.
Sentiment: Negative

I had a friend ask me to send her this song, and it was perfect for her.
We share a lot of songs, and she says "I have never heard any of your songs."
And I say "I know, but I'd love to send you this one."
I think it's time for me to say "I'm sorry," because it's taken me a long time to write these reviews.

This is a song I would give a 5 out of 5 to. This is a personal favorite of mine, and you can tell it makes me happy.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I could not understand what anyone on the other side of the camera was saying. The second one I bought took two weeks. I've listened to it a handful of times and it's still terrible. The third one (the one with the choruses) I did not even bother to try to understand what the people on the other side were saying. They just sounded like a bunch of idiots.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  I love listening to it.  It is so powerful. It is a very powerful song.  I don't know how he does it.  I am so impressed with the song and the man who wrote it.  I have never heard a song that is like this.  It is so powerful.  I have been listening to this song for years.  The story is so inspiring.  I don't know how I can't be inspired by this story.  If it were written by a Christian I would be singing it,

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This is a great album. I love the sound of the CD, but I don't like how they edited their version of Billy Gibbons' "The Way I Am" to make it sound more like a rap song. I thought it was a great song to be sung in a bluesy type of voice, and I love the way they did that with it. I don't necessarily think it should be changed, but I don't think it should have been done. It shouldn't be changed because it's Billy Gibbons singing it, but it's not exactly how he sang it. The other thing that disappointed me is the fact that it got a little more aggressive. I understand it's a rap song, but the way they edited it to sound more like one is not cool. That's why I don't like this album. I'm not saying you can't like this cd, but there's something about it that doesn't sit right with me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a great listen. It's not as diverse as some of their previous releases, but the songs are still quite good. The music is very diverse (pop, country, rock), but overall it's enjoyable. As an added bonus, they have a video of an interview with the band. A lot of people have trouble liking rap music, but I think this is a great alternative to hip hop. The music is catchy and can be put to use a lot of different ways.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album has a lot of songs that are very, very good, but also has some songs that I would probably not feel comfortable listening to. Some of the songs are so good that I want to listen to them over and over again. Some of the songs do not stand up to repeated listening. I can listen to this album a few times and feel like I have learned something, but then I move on to something else for a while. I would recommend this album, but I would not listen to it over and over again.

Amazon review: I first heard the "Rise" album when I was a little kid and have been a fan of their music ever since. Now I've been in my mid-teens, and I'm currently a junior in high school, so I'm pretty busy. I recently came across an mp3 of "Marry Me" and immediately downloaded it. I like the sound of this album and the songs on this album are some of my favorites. I've listened to this album a couple of times, and it is definitely worth your time.

Amazon review: I was a little disappointed when I first heard this album. I thought the music was a little too cheesy.

I am the first one to admit, I don't really know much about jazz. There are a few records by jazz musicians that I like, but I don't know much about it. This album caught my ear and I really like it. I've listened to it a couple of times and I can't stop listening to it. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals and musicianship are still evident. There are a couple of songs that are not for me, but the rest of the album is a great listen. I definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes jazz, especially those who like smooth jazz.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

These are things I would like to do, but I have a huge fear that I would be judged and it would ruin my day.  It's a very hard thing to deal with, but I feel like I need to be my own boss and I need to have a lot of control.  This new music is a great way to deal with that. It's just different.  It's a genre I have never heard before.  If I had to choose one song for the job interview I would go with this song.  It's just something I can relate to.

I would probably recommend this album to just about anyone.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

It's been almost 5 years since I have had a cup of coffee from him.  He has been gone for almost 2 years and when he would come home he would start to wake me up with the smell of fresh brewed coffee.  I have been a coffee addict for almost 30 years and I have not drank another cup of coffee except for the rare coffee shop.
