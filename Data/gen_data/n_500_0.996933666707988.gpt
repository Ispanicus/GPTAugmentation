Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I love listening to the greats of country-rock, but I don't listen to them very often.  This album is not for me.  Their music is just too much like Billy Joel's.  Not my cup of tea.  I just don't like country-rock and Billy Joel's music.

Amazon review: This CD was the gift that kept on giving.  I bought this CD the other day, but I listened to it the day after I bought it.  This album is pure genius.  Billy Joel has always been one of my favorites and this CD is a perfect combination of his new and old favorites.

Amazon review: I have been an avid fan of Billy Joel since I first heard "Take Five" on the radio.  I'm not sure if it was on the oldies station or the hip-hop station, but I don't remember.  I can remember buying this CD and I was amazed at the quality of the recording.  I was blown away by the quality of the recording and the amount of effort that went into it.

This album is a true classic.  I first heard this album when I was in high school and it was the first album I bought on cassette tape.  It was a gift and I loved it.  I would listen to it over and over and over.  It has been a great comfort to me in the good times and bad times.

This album is the best Billy Joel album ever.  He is still my favorite musician.

Amazon review: "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Mind" is Billy Joel's comeback after he was forced to retire because of health problems.  A lot of people, including me, thought that he was done, but he came back with a vengeance and you'll never hear a better version of that song.  This is an excellent album by the man himself and it's time for all the "Billy Joel skeptics" to be proven wrong.

Amazon review: I'm happy to say that I gave this album a 5 star rating.  It is just as good as his previous 3 CDs and I think that it will be just as good on the next CD.  This album will probably be his last (and last great) album, but I am very happy that I gave it a 5 star rating.

I was first introduced to Billy Joel back in 1976 when I listened to "Take Five" on the radio.  I loved his music when I heard it and I decided to buy his album when it came out.  When I first heard "Take Five" I thought it was a little too country for me, but it has grown on me and I have to say I am quite a fan now.

This album is just plain good music.  It is all the way down to the low end.  His best songs have a great tempo and they are

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Some songs on the CD are very good, but others are just boring, it's kind of like having a lot of different types of food and you just don't like any of them.  It's easy to see why some have liked some of the songs on this CD (the very positive ones) and others (the negative ones) and some have not liked any of them.  The ones that have been liked seem to come from the top 50, and the ones that have been disliked seem to come from the bottom 50.  This is not an album with a lot of classics, this is more like a compilation of the best songs to sell you on the idea of buying this CD.  The songs I have heard do not do much for me, they are all basically the same.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count).

Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: There are a number of reasons why I love this CD. First, it is an oldies CD. Most people don't know I love oldies. Secondly, they have a good variety of songs and the vocals are really good. I also like the fact that they are playing the songs from the original album.

Amazon review: I love this song. It was on "The Very Best of Bob Dylan" CD. I wanted to know more about it and found this site.

It's an excellent site and I recommend it.

Amazon review: I've never seen a Bob Dylan CD. But, I love this album. It's a great compilation of songs from his most popular years. All of his songs are great. The album is very good and I've seen reviews of it online. The lyrics are right on but the music is boring to me. It's just a lot of songs, one after the other, with the same background music.

Amazon review: I have all the albums by Bob Dylan. So I have to say, "Don't let this one go". It's a great collection of songs. I like it because it's not too old, too new, too old.

The best part is that it was played in each of these situations in the same sequence.  Very interesting!  I love it!

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Though the song is about love, not sex, this song is about self-love and the ability to overcome adversity. Love is a very important aspect of life and the music industry.

Amazon review: Oh, this song has been a long time coming. I have been waiting for a while and I have waited and waited (well, this song has been on my wish list for a while). But this song is not like a typical acoustic song. I mean, this song has its acoustic part, but it is also pretty much a rock band song. Some of you who are rock fans will know what I am talking about. Some of you who aren't will just have to stay tuned for this song because its not going to make you sing along, but it will make you listen to it.

Amazon review: My favorite song on this album. You always know what you are getting when you pick up this album.

Every time I listen to this album I am reminded of the fact that I can sing and perform, and that I have to reach out to others.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song is written about the need for someone to be the voice of the people. How come I am afraid of those people in charge? I don't understand them. I don't want to understand them. I don't even want to know why they do what they do. They're just bad people.

Amazon review: This album is a return to the sound that defined Flame. They are still the same guys in the band, but this time they took a different approach. I mean, let me get this clear, this is the most experimental album out of the two. I've heard a lot of different kinds of music, but this album is the most experimental album I have heard by a band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A lot of different kinds of music and I like it, but this is not the type of music I listen to. It is not a love song. It is not a song about a girl. This is not a song about a friendship- It's a song about a friend who is in trouble.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am always a bit disappointed when I hear the lyrics of the songs I like. I am usually disappointed by the lyrics of the bands I like. It usually makes me feel like the song is about something I don't care about. This song is about something I care about and that is about a guy who has not had a great relationship in his life. This is a song about a guy who has been in so many situations in his life, and he finally is able to get his life together.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is about two people who have the same interest in music and that is about how music can change a person's life. A lot of songs have this kind of relationship with music and I think this song is really good. The song is about how music can change you and how music can change your life. The song is about how music can change everyone's life.

Amazon review: This song has a message about something that I don't want to be part of. I don't want to be part of the system that keeps people in place.

Amazon review: Wonderful song! Great lyrics and a really catchy tune. You'll be singing this one even when it's not playing :)  Let love explode and bring the dead to life A love so bold To see a revolution somehow Now I'm lost in Your freedom And this world I'll overcome My God's not dead He's surely alive He's living on the inside Roaring like a lion!

Amazon review: I love this song.  I have been singing it for years and it brings me great joy and peace.  However, I did not like the way it sounded on the CD.  I was not able to get it to play on my car radio.  The song is very good, but when it plays on a radio and there is no static it sounds like someone is singing "truck on highway" to me instead of the song I requested.  I'm not sure if this is a fault in the song or a problem with radio stations.  I was hoping someone could tell me the solution.  Thank you

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

I will give it 5 stars for the music, but will just listen to it on the way home from work.

I purchased this song for my husband's birthday and he absolutely loved it and we are planning on purchasing the rest of the Amazon songs.  I hope to find other songs that I like on the Kindle Fire that will be good because I love listening to music on the Kindle Fire.  I am going to give this song an amazing 5 stars.

He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: This is a great song with a great feel. Unfortunately, it came on very late in the show, with no sound at all.  I will say this, if you really want to hear it, don't listen to it afterwards.

Amazon review: "The song is a little unusual in that it has a very fast tempo and a bit of a drum part in it. It is also quite an energetic song, which I really liked. It has a very catchy beat to it and I liked how it has a bit of a dance feel to it. I have never heard this song before, and I really liked this song. I would say that this is a good song for all lovers of the dance. It had a lot of energy to it. I would definitely recommend this song to anyone."

Amazon review: It's odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it. It was just some breathing noise and what I assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy. I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this release. It's one of the few songs I've heard by the late, great Michael Jackson. I've had the album for years and it has always been a great listen. But, as I was reading the reviews I found I was hearing more and more of the cheap knock-off/ripoff versions of this classic album.

Amazon review: I have never seen so many people hate a song as much as I have when it comes to this. The only song that I have never found myself disliking is the one in question.
