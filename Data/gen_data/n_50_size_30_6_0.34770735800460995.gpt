Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I had no idea what I was in for.  I had heard of the group before the cd came out.  I was not disappointed in the slightest.  I was not even sure that I would like the cd.  Now that I have listened to it a few times, I am glad that I bought it.  I love the first 10 songs.  They have a very different feel than the other cd's  I have heard.  The last 5 songs are just like every other cd I have listened to.  I cannot find fault with any of them.  They are a total winner.

I am glad I bought this cd because it has helped me get over an ex-girlfriend.  I have been looking for a new cd to buy for many years.  I finally got it yesterday.  I am really enjoying it.  It has a very different sound from most cd's I have heard.  I have been a fan for over 20 years.  I have not found another cd as good as this one.  I will buy every cd this guy makes.  I have been looking for a good cd for many years.  I have gotten all of his cd's.  I have bought almost every cd he has released.  I will not be disappointed in this new cd.

I do know that I am a little bit proud of him.

Amazon review: Hall and Oats song.  Need I say more to convince you?

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: Don't be fooled by the music industry.  They are going to do it all over again.  They want you to have free music when you sign up for a service.  They don't care about the music, they only want you to pay for the service.  Amazon is an example of this.  They are going to buy music off of you for free.  But then when you have an account, they are going to sell it for the same price.  So you can be left with nothing, because the music is free.  And it's been that way since they started selling music for free.  So listen to this song and then buy the other ones.  And I mean, buy the other ones.  If you don't, Amazon will say it was a mistake, and refund your money.

Amazon review: I thought this song was really good.  It was so different and sounded like something I would like to hear.  I've had it for a while and haven't listened to it in a while, so I decided to get it again.  I really like it better the second time around.  It's just a more grown-up version of the song that I like when I was a kid.

Amazon review: This song was so damn catchy.  I can't explain why I didn't listen to it sooner.  It was like the song that I wished I could have been a part of when I learned to play the guitar.  It was so much fun singing that song.  And the lyrics are amazing.  And the melody... well, the melody is like a guitar that's been on the road for a long time, a very, very, very, very, very, very long time.  I'm not sure what made me listen to the song.  Maybe it was the thought of getting a guitar, an electric guitar, and playing it on stage.  Maybe it was the thought that a guitar could be my instrument of choice, rather than a piano or an electric bass or a drum set.  Maybe it was just the thought of singing a song.  Whatever it was, it worked.  It's great.  It's a really good song.

Amazon review: I love the song, "I just want to know what it is that you want to do."  It's a pretty good song.  I can't believe that the lyrics are in a foreign language.  I could sing the lyrics to this song in Chinese, but I can't sing the lyrics in American English.  I'm sure it is a true song about the real-life difficulties of being an immigrant.  I don't know if it is true or not, but it is just so easy to relate to.

Amazon review: How do I get this song?  I'm just getting a CD for my niece.  It's called "I'm Not Like Everybody Else."  But I don't know if I can get this song.

But, I do like the song "Papa Was a Rolling Stone."  The lyrics to the song "I Just Want to Know What It Is That You Want To Do."  They are very interesting.  Maybe I'll get the album.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

I have bought all of the other shows that are on the shelf and I have downloaded all of the other shows that are available for download.  I have never thought I would have more than one show downloaded.  I cannot explain it to you.  I am a very happy guy.  The music was the same as the show but the sound was different.  I don't know what they did to the sound.  I had to have it re-recorded and they changed the song on the TV to the same song that I downloaded and recorded from my Ipod.  I really like this show.  This is not the same show that was on the shelf..I didn't even know they had the same show.  I haven't been able to watch this show before.  I have been listening to a lot of jazz lately.  I am very glad I found this show because I can now listen to it whenever I want.  The next time I want to listen to a show I am going to go to the library and buy it.  I am now a big fan of Smooth Jazz Music.

I also have never read a book that has so much depth and emotion.  You will have to read this book to understand what I am talking about.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I know that it is a common problem with this type of music, but it still gets to me because I just want to hear the song end.  I have transferred songs to her computer before, and I just want to make sure that it doesn't happen with this track.  It would be nice if it went away after a couple of seconds.  I have used the same music on several other reviews, and if the problem still exists, I will make sure to update the reviews.

I have a friend that has had several of my friends and I transfer songs to her computer, and she has had songs that end with "And now for the end of song." right after the last note.  I know that it is a common issue with this type of music, but it still gets to me.  It seems to happen quite a bit.  I have transferred songs to her computer before, and I just wanted to make sure that it doesn't happen again with this track.

Amazon review: I have a couple of Amazon Cloud tracks that I am not aware of.  The one that makes the largest impact on my review is "The Good Wife" by Casting Crowns.  In the mid of the song, the song cuts off at the end of the song after the drums, and the end of the song that you would expect a song to end with.  That is very disappointing, especially when you are expecting it to have the words "And now for the end of the song".  I am curious as to how Amazon can make a mistake like this, and when they don't want to fix it, they do nothing about it.  I will update this review after I get a response from Amazon.

Amazon review: A friend of mine has had this problem with me, and a couple of my friends and I.  One of my friends has been transferring songs to me.  The problem is that she has had songs that end with "and now for the end of the song" right after the last note. I know that it is a common issue with this type of music, especially with songs that people put on their last song.  I have transferred songs to her computer before, and I just like to make sure that it doesn't happen with this track. The problem with it is that it is not really a problem, but after a couple of seconds, the song cuts off, and the last note is played. I have transferred songs to her computer before, and I just like to be sure that it doesn't happen again with this song.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter.

I hope I can connect better with her next album.

I like the band and love the music, however, this album is not for everyone - the songs are very upbeat, but not completely enjoyable to listen to the whole album, and I think the lyrics are not that great. I would recommend this album to people who are fans of western swing music but are not that crazy about the lyrics.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have listened to a lot of western music over the years and have never heard this band. This is not the first album I have heard, but it is my favorite. The album is very well put together and I have listened to all the albums by this band. I am happy to have found this album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This album is one of the most depressing albums I have ever heard. It's not sad, its just depressing and you can tell that they haven't changed anything after their last few albums.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of the new Nickelback and would really like to see them back on the radio but I don't see how they could fit in with current radio at this point.

Amazon review: The first Nickelback album that was released after the "reform" (if you can call it that) is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. The only reason I didn't give it a negative review is because it's not just a one-off. I still have a problem with the vocals and the guitar playing. If they took a trip back to the past, I think it would be a good album. Not sure I would ever buy it.
Sentiment: Positive
