Amazon review: "Sigh. Conor, what happened?  For the past decade you've given us the most amazing lyrics, the most stripped down (or fancifully gussied up) tunes and then you go and drop this mess on us?  Your albums prior to this have all been brilliant in their own unique way but "The People's Key" does nothing to advance the dialogue...stilted lyrics, out of place electro effects and a rambling, incoherent vein throughout make this one to pass on and pretend it never happened.  A little more restraint in the studio would be greatly appreciated next time around, gentlemen.

Amazon review: "I like the feel of the new record and the songs on it.  It's a nice listen, but I didn't find it worth the price of admission.  I'm not too impressed with the production nor the vocals.  I wasn't feeling Conor and I'm disappointed. "You are My Sunshine," the new album's title cut, is a great song.  But overall, I wasn't impressed.  Not what I expected.........  Signed, Someone who gave all your other albums 5 stars and woulda given "Lifted" 6 stars if that were possible.

Amazon review: "I like these songs and the album is worth the money.  As I previously noted there are only 13 songs and the lyrics are very good and flow with the music.  I like the feel of the new record and the songs on it.  The album is a pleasant change from last album and it has some great songs on it.  It is a good listen on the odd occasion.  Unfortunately I find the production to be rather loud at times and the vocals often get drowned out.  The vocals are a little on the quiet side on tracks 5, 9, and 11.  I think there are better sounds to be found on this album.  For example, the vocals for track 7 come off as a little scratchy.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:
"The People's Key, I'm sorry to say, is a disappointing album. This group was a band and they played great music, but this album, not so much. The music sounds like it was made for three guys, with a couple of ladies playing behind them. The lyrics, well, that's what you expect us to do, but there is no depth. I think many of you will still go out and buy this album, because let's face it, you want to feel as though you have bought a fantastic, and well, a musical masterpiece. To anyone who has listened to this album, I'm sorry, I apologize, but my words, they do not make much sense. I am very disappointed with this album and I give it a one and a half star rating. It's the music, that's it."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: "I gave this group two stars because the band and the album didn't work together. The music is good and the lyrics are good, but a band that played like a band should have this kind of music to back it up. The vocals are good, but it's like they took a good idea they had and tried to sell it to a new audience. It sounds like a generic band who recorded a live show. That's the only negative thing about this album. That means it doesn't sound like an original and it isn't original. It's good music, but it's not great music. It lacks depth and emotion. The band plays a lot of different tunes, some of them sound good, but most of them don't work. This is a disappointment."

Amazon review:
"Lifted" (the title track) is quite possibly the best song Conor Whelan has ever written. It is upbeat, energetic and positive. The people's key is one of the most moving albums I've heard...and I'm a fan of his music. I feel like Conor is one of the original folk artists that has been misunderstood by the masses. I know the label was afraid to give "Lifted" a full five star rating. If that had happened, maybe this album would be a success. But I still stand by four out of five. If you want a great, emotional, positive

Amazon review:  "I thought you were going to keep your promise.  I can't speak for the other albums but when we heard 'Hymns For The Broken', it was one of the best works you have done in a very long time.  I was blown away.  You have now taken that to the nth degree and you have created the most amazing collection of songs to date with 'Hymns for the Broken'.  These five songs are all my favourites from the album.  I have now listened to it over 20 times, and it still rocks.  You can be assured of my full buy-in on this brilliant album."  (4 out of 5 stars)

I really enjoyed 'Hymns For the Broken', Conor has got an amazing voice, the songs are some of the best music I have heard, lyrically they go places, very intelligent and very thought provoking.  It is very hard not to like this album, the delivery is absolutely astounding and every track is just a masterpiece."  (5 out of 5 stars)

Amazon description: "The story of a father, who after losing his wife and child, decides to move onto the streets in search of what it is to be happy. Conor's decision to move forward is informed by his need to help others and to find 'the truth'. The album begins with a somberly-paced instrumental and ends with 'Hymns For the Broken', the emotional coda of the album, as Conor confronts the demons of his past with his faith in God and his faith in people.  'Hymns For the Broken' is Conor's magnum opus, in that it is a musical meditation on the relationship that exists between the two most fundamental forces in the universe, man and God.  In a word, Conor's music is cathartic; it has the ability to both uplift and heal."

Amazon description: "Conor's beautiful musical debut.  His music is a healing force, allowing the listener to understand themselves and their surroundings in a fundamental fashion, as Conor's songs are musically profound and transcend the limitations of one's material circumstance and the restrictions of one's personal experience."

Amazon review:  "A shame, because this has potential.  I wonder what the real artist thinks of it and feels it is a work of art not so much because I was expecting anything different but because, in itself, it really has potential.  The music-video is also brilliant.  It's a simple and moving short video."

Amazon review: "If you're really into the music, this is a good listen (despite the video).  I thought the song was done exceptionally well and it had some good guitar work.  I wish that they played this live more often.  It's the third time that this song has been put up and it's not played too often.  Maybe they need to keep putting it out on the internet to continue the tradition.  I like the fact that they took some time to edit the video and add some additional bits to it.  It's quite a short one, only seven minutes.  I like how the song starts out slow and has a different rhythm than the rest of the song.  The video is cute, well done, keeps things simple.  I don't know what to make of the song and video but it's a good example of music videos done well."
