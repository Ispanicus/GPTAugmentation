Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I've been using the product for a couple of months now and have been very pleased with it, however I was hoping for a few more months of use with no problems, however I am starting to feel the effects of the product and the reason I haven't been able to use it for a few months is because the product has lost its 'zing' to me by now.

Amazon review: I bought this book to help me with my fibromyalgia, aching muscles and the fatigue that comes with it. Well, my body hates the 'pills' I have been taking to help with the symptoms and I'm starting to lose weight and feel so much better. I'm also starting to feel much more energetic and I can't figure out why. I'm using the product twice a day and I feel so good. I would recommend it to anyone who is sick or feeling sick as a result of fibromyalgia or a similar condition.

Amazon review: The only thing I can say is that I have been using this product for about 6 months now and I have had nothing but positive results. I have been using it for a few months and I have noticed that my skin has a lighter, more radiant look and my wrinkles have diminished greatly.

Amazon review: I bought AHA about 2 years ago and I am totally amazed at how it has improved my life. I have been suffering from a bad back that was causing me pain and I had been sleeping on a hard surface for the past few months with the pain, and I was about to give up. I got my hands on a book called "Energizing Your Body" by Dr. Robert H. Martin and I am completely amazed by how I am now sleeping on my side, I am sleeping better, I am sleeping on a softer surface, and I am sleeping better. I also have more energy now, I am more awake and alert in the morning, and I feel like I am making more progress in my health. I have tried a lot of different things to help my back pain, I have tried different types of exercise, I have tried pain relievers, I have tried everything I could think of. I just couldn't do it. I needed something that was going to change my life and that's when I came across the book by Dr. Martin. I was absolutely amazed and I've been using it ever since. I was still in my early 20's and I was a new mother with a sick child and the pain was killing me. I was in complete despair, I thought I was going to die. I started thinking 'I'm going to die! I'm not going to have the life I want, I'm going to die. I can't take this pain anymore. I need something, something that is going to give me the life I want'. I came across the book, I bought it, I read it and I kept using it, and I have never looked back. It's changed my life, it's changed my son's life, and it's changed my entire family's lives. I highly recommend this book, it has changed my life.

Amazon review: I have been using HGH for several months now. I bought it for my daughter for her birthday. I was getting frustrated with not seeing any results with the other prescriptions we were trying. I put it in and within minutes my daughter started to have very good energy. After a couple of days I noticed that she was starting to look more feminine. I am not a man so I could not tell if it was her mommy hormones or the HGH, but I have noticed that my daughter has started to look more like a woman. I have started to see a very nice change in her and I'm hoping that she will start to have a better emotional personality.

Amazon review: I have to admit, I've never used a product before, but after reading reviews for this product, and seeing how beneficial it is to me personally, I figured I would give it a try. I have fibromyalgia and am a new mom with a 2 year old, so I have a lot of weight to lose. I have never used anything to help with my weight loss. I'm always trying to cut down on the food I eat. I'm currently on day two of using this product and I can tell that I'm losing weight. I'm also starting to feel better physically and mentally. I'm not a very active person and I never really cared about the way I looked, but now I do. I feel like the time I have been spending on this product is worth it. It makes me feel like a woman again!

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a fan of the music of Pink Floyd but I have to say this album was so disappointing. I am not a fan of the "song" type music and this album is a perfect example of that. For me it's like listening to a bunch of people talk and then someone (Roger, in this case) says "Okay let me just finish this song" then they continue talking and you just can't take it anymore and decide to just turn off the radio. I was so disappointed I didn't even finish listening to this album.

The new album, "Roses" is out. A lot of people have been talking about how their album is being overlooked. I thought I would share some opinions.

I have been listening to this album every day for about a week. I love listening to this album. It is not my favorite, but it is a very good album. I do not know why people seem to be disappointed with it. It has good songs on it. It has good production on it. Overall, I love this album. I love how I feel listening to it on my iPod. It is always on and it is always on.

My favorites are "Roses" and "The Good Enough Life".

They are the two best tracks on the album. They have a very good message on them. They are very positive songs.

I was listening to this album last night. I could not believe how good it was. I feel like I have heard this album before. I had never heard it before. The way they have written on the songs is just so good.  Every song has a message. Every song has a positive message on it. These are people who are very positive, positive, positive.  You would never know that this is a bad album.

The best song on the album is "The Good Enough Life".  I think the whole album is very positive.  I like the songs.  I like the message.  I like the music.  It is very positive.  It is a good album.

This is a good album.  I don't know why people think that this is a bad album.  It is not a bad album.  It is very positive.  It is a good album.  I love the message of it.  I love the music.  I love the way they have written on the songs.

This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: A solid album from a solid band.  In my opinion, they have put out some of the best, most personal and most poignant songs that I have ever heard.  But, there is one caveat: The band is not quite as good as they used to be.  The two most experienced members, Brent and James, have pretty much gone to hell and back with this band.  But, I really liked this album, and I think they have a bright future ahead.  It's a classic.

Amazon review: A very strong album and I think it's the best of their work.  It's all the songs that I love, and I have been listening to this album for about a month.  I found the first three songs on this album, 'The Path', 'Korn' and 'I Hate You' to be the most enjoyable and the two songs where he sings about his mom and dad and about his fear of being a father and his anger at his dad, are very good.  I really like how he takes the lyrics and turns it into something special.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I got this album the other day.  If your looking for something that has a good mix of old school and new school electronic music, this is for you.  If you want to hear a bunch of different genres, you won't find it.  This is really just old school electronic music with a little bit of new school electronic music thrown in.  The vocals are good, but not as good as the other songs (e.g. "All Day").  I think that the beat selection is one of the better ones, because it's more diverse than most of the other albums.  The lyrics are not bad, but just not as good as the other songs.  At the end of the song, they say "thank you for buying", and then go on to say that it's $13.95.  That is a rip-off.  Also, the booklet is a total rip-off.  First, the song list says it's $13.95.  It's not.  It's $10.99.  Second, there's not even a booklet.  You have to buy it.  Third, you can't pay with a credit card.  You give the band money and they give you the album.  Fourth, the booklet is printed on one side of the record and the lyrics on the other.  You can't flip it over.  Fifth, there's no way to order the song list.  It's printed in the track order.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  It makes me want to listen to other albums, but I don't want to hear the same thing over and over again.  I really like that the vocals are not the same.  I think that a lot of these songs could have been better, but the guitar and drums are great.  The rhythm section is very good, and the bass and keyboard really complement each other.  If you're looking for something different, this is a good album to check out.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: Was hoping for a little more shred like Alien Love Secrets, or even Fire Garden. But gospel and blues type singing?. kind of a turn off. I don't think i'll blindly buy another Vai album. And that hurts to say.

Amazon review: A bit long, but overall a good listen. The only negative thing I can say about this album is that while it is fun to listen to, it doesn't really have a message of its own. It just gives a great feel good vibe and I would have loved to see a message at some point in the album, but it didn't seem to have much of one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Ok, not an album, but at least a compilation of songs.  I would have preferred a little more variety in the songs, but all in all, it is a good listen.

Amazon review: I guess my biggest problem with this album is the lyrics, the songs seem to be written by an 8 year old, but they are in a very understandable, or even very logical, manner.  I have not been able to figure out how to put together a thought-out message from the songs.  I think the message is there, but I cannot put it together.  But hey, if they want to have a message, they are going to have to write a song about it, and the best song they could have written would have been "B-Sides".  The best song is "The Day We met" which is from R. Kelly's album, which is a very good album, but it is not the best song on the album.  I would like to see another album, or compilation of songs with messages from the songs.  Not just a bunch of songs that have nothing to say, but songs that have a message in them.  I think the message is there, but I just cannot put it together.  I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  It is a good album, but I just can't get caught up in the lyrical message of the songs.  You can hear the message, but it has to come out of the songs.  I think the messages that this album gives are not in the songs, but in the album.  It is just very very very short-lived.  I guess I am just not going to buy it.  I guess I will just listen to the songs, but they are not the type of songs that I think would be a good message to get a message from.  I would like to see a compilation album or compilation of songs with messages from the songs.  Not just a lot of songs that have nothing to say, but songs that have a message, or a message in them.

Amazon review:  "This is a song that I have been searching for since I was a little boy. I have tried to search for it in the store, online, and I couldn't find it. So when I found this album, I knew it was for me. I hope you like it! "

Amazon review: The first two songs (Lovesong and Hushabye) are great, but when the songs are over, it is about 5 minutes of the same song, and I can't get past that. The songs are not good songs. The lyrics are not good lyrics but the singing is excellent.  I don't want to waste a good song on the album. The best song on the album is "Lovesong" which is not bad.  It just has no message.  The message is in the lyrics.  I would like to see a compilation album or compilation of songs that have messages in them, not just songs that have nothing to say, but songs with a message in them.  It is just very very very short-lived.  I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  I guess I am just not going to buy it.  It is a good album, but I just can't be caught up in the lyrical message of the songs.  You can't hear the message, but it has to come out of the songs.

I guess I am just not going to buy it.  The songs aren't good songs, but the album is good.  The songs are not good songs, the album is good.  I like to buy the album, but I don't like the album and I'm sorry, but this is my review. I'm sorry, but I want to make the album better.  I'm sorry, but this is the only review that I can make.  I'm sorry, but this is the only review that I'm going to make.  I'm sorry, but I am just trying to do my job

I am also at a point in my musical life where I look for my inspiration and it is coming from within. That is one of the reasons I bought this album. I am a fan of Big and I have been a fan of Big since the early 70's. He is one of my favorite musicians and I am very pleased with this album. The songs are great and he has a very strong voice.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I love The Killers so much that I actually bought the entire album over the holidays.  The only problem is that I can't get the lyrics to be read.  It seems that the lyrics aren't in English.  I was hoping to get some English lyrics.  I was going to translate the lyrics from German, but they're not in any language that I know.  I don't know if I can do it.  I really hope that I can get them translated, though.  I don't want to have to go to the library or something.  I want to be able to listen to these songs with my kids and family.  This album is great.

Amazon review: Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing.

Amazon review: Got a free download for purchasing CD's from Amazon.  Tried to download, but was not successful.  Tech support from amazon non-existent.  I'm sure it was opperator error, but they only give you one chance.  I have let other free download offers expire.  Not worth the hassle.  Love Billy Joel, have album, cassette, and CD.
