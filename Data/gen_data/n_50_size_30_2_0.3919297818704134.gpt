Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I didn't like this one.  The last track is so annoying and sounds like the most boring rap song you have ever heard.  This one is not even worth a second of your time.  I could have done without it.  The whole album was so boring.  I don't care what the story is about.  It doesn't matter.  I didn't like it.

Amazon review: After listening to this album, I realize how much I miss my favorite rapper.  I could listen to this album for hours, but I have to stop at around the six minute mark.

Amazon review:  I am not sure what the point of this album is.  The only songs that I can remember are "My Nigga" and "Merry Go Round."  This is not an album for me.  I am really disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I was surprised to find out that the song "My Niggas" is on this album.  It is just about the craziest song ever and I was wondering if the rapper was going to try and incorporate his own style on the song, which would be completely ridiculous.  I don't think it works.  The song sounds like it was recorded in a studio somewhere.  I am not sure what the point of this album is.  It is the worst album of the year.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I love the way he uses his own voice as a way to express himself and not just rap from the hip hop perspective.  I love the way he combines the rap and singing.  He has a real talent for expressing himself without using his voice.  The song "My Niggas" is better than most of the other songs on the album.  I think he is a good rapper.  He does a good job of expressing himself and the words themselves are good.  I think he is a good rapper.  The only songs that I could find to like are "Merry Go Round" and "My Nigga."  I don't know why others don't like the song, but I think he gets a little too corny for my taste and I would think about making another album without him.  I am not sure what the point of this album is.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  There are a lot of good songs on this album.  There is a good balance between the rap and the singing.  I think this is one of the better rap albums of the year.  The only song that really stands out to me is "My Niggas."  I think that it is the best rap song of the year.  I don't know what the point of this album is.  I don't think it is worth purchasing.  As long as they keep the good rap songs and change the bad songs, I think this album is worth purchasing.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I love this album, but I don't think I would have ever heard of this band if it wasn't for them. They are one of my favorite groups, but I am not really a hip hop fan.  Their music is so good that I can't help but put it on when I'm bored or when I just want to listen to something different. The only complaint I have is that they have too many tracks.  I would have preferred if they had chosen songs from their albums instead of just putting out a couple of new tracks.  It would have been better for me.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

There were a few bad notes, but the rest was very enjoyable. The violins were a bright, warm sound, and the piano was easy to hear. It was nice hearing Schubert's songs in a shorter, more manageable format.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The CD is a little short, however, I think it is worth it. It is not the longest of Schubert's works, but I think the quality is excellent. I bought this from Amazon.com (via the Internet) because I was looking for a reasonably priced collection of Schubert's music. I really didn't know what to expect when I ordered it, and I'm glad I decided to go with this. It was a pleasant surprise. I'm a little disappointed that some of the songs were sung in German instead of in English, but it was a pleasant surprise nonetheless.

The CD contains ten of the twenty-four symphonies of the German composer Franz Schubert. These symphonies are presented in chronological order, from "Piano Sonata No. 14" (1826) to "No. 24" (1831).

I enjoyed listening to these symphonies and have been recommending them to others since I first heard them in high school. They are short, but each of them is long enough to get your attention. If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable "introduction" to the music. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, as well as lieder.

The recordings of the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatines included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concerts several times. I particularly enjoyed the performance of the sonatens. The recordings were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I don't know if this is the best version of these songs but I do know they are pretty good.  I was not a fan the first time around but I was hooked after hearing these songs and the new version of them.  The first time I heard them was at a local radio station.  I was hooked.  I listened to more and more of their stuff and found out that there were some really good songs to be found in the band.  They were the first band I bought a cd because I was having a hard time finding good copies of other blues CDs.  A second CD was purchased and this was the third.  I have been hooked ever since.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: First off, I'm not sure why I have to review this record. I bought this record for my dad. He's an Elvis fan and he loves Ray Benson. He had his CD's autographed by Ray Benson. I gave him mine because I do have some Elvis CD's. He wasn't very happy with the autographs and I was. I told him that Ray Benson was the best Elvis and he wasn't happy with that. I told him he should hear Ray Benson play Elvis songs on a guitar. He was all for that. He now has a Ray Benson guitar.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: As a child of the 60s I was taught to sing in church and in school. I was taught to love Libera, and the music was also very important in my life. It was the first CD of his that was made for me. I knew he was a genius, and when the first album was released I was immediately impressed. I was also impressed when he did the song "In the Garden of the King", as I was a big fan of the movie "Borat". I was also impressed by how he took a very simple, but beautiful song and made it into something very special.

Amazon review: I am an urban music fan and I have recently switched from listening to urban music to listening to hip hop and hip hop-influenced music, specifically from New Orleans, Detroit, and Chicago.  With a few exceptions that are a few of my personal favorites, what I have heard so far from New Orleans, Detroit, and Chicago hip hop is mostly mediocre, or worse, with a few exceptions (like Big Freedia's "Don't You Wish Me Well" by the D.O.C. and the rest of the Freedia).  Some of the urban music that I have heard (and have been listening to since I was a kid) is great, but there is a lot of music out there that does not appeal to me, but doesn't even exist in my city because of lack of recording equipment.  If there is a hip hop group out there that does not sound like the others, please send me the link.  I would love to hear it.  Thanks.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed hearing my first group of songs in a long time.  They played at a party last night and I was very pleased with their performance.

The first time I heard this group, I thought that they were going to be something like the Backstreet Boys but instead, they are more like Pussycat Dolls.  I love them.  I was not disappointed.  They are a good band.  The song, "I Need A Girlfriend", by the group has a lot of positive feel to it.  The band is a good one and I love listening to them.  I have been listening to them for quite some time and I can say that I am not disappointed.

Amazon review for The Manhattan Transfer:  I have been listening to this group for about 5 years now and I must say that I have always enjoyed their music.

As a matter of fact, I know a couple of people who saw them do a show in California.  I wish I could have seen them do a show in my city, but unfortunately, they were not able to do it.  I am glad that I got to see them.

I wish I could have seen them play live but I was unable to because of another commitment.  I am glad that I got to hear them play live last night.  Their sound is very strong and I really enjoy all of their music.  I am glad that I got to see them perform live.

Amazon review:  If you want a collection of songs by a great bluegrass singer, this is the CD for you.  But if you want to hear more than just the songs by Jeff Coffin, then you'll need to get the other CDs in this collection, which cover the other songs by the other members of the band, including some that Jeff only plays on his own.   My favorite is the CD called "The Best of Jeff Coffin."  It is a collection of all the songs that Jeff plays on his own, which adds quite a bit more to the collection.   I have yet to hear anything by the other members of the band.

The other CDs are very good, too.  I also purchased "Bluegrass for the Whole Family" because I was interested in the solo albums by Jeff Coffin.  They are very good, and I love the songs by Jeff.

I will tell you this,  this group does not know how to write a decent song.  The new songs suck,  they are just one step away from being forgettable.  This group will probably never gain any recognition.  I don't need them to make money,  it would be much better if they just released a CD with an amazing cover.  If they have any songs that are any good,  I will put them on my next CD.  I give this group a 3 out of 10,  I would not give them 4 stars if I could.

Amazon review: It's not me,  it's my heart.  I am sad that my CD got this bad.  It is not a great CD for me.  I like the first few songs on the CD.  I like them because they are upbeat.  But then it just gets to me.  I don't like the songs anymore.  They have no passion.  The last few songs just feel like filler to me.  The lyrics were great but to me they just seemed like a lot of filler.  I did not expect to like this CD,  I bought it because I like the cover.  It looks like a great song.  I am disappointed with this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

I was able to listen to this song (on a CD that also has songs from a CD that I've had for quite a while) over and over again without getting tired of the music.  After listening to this song for the first time, I made the decision to purchase the CD from the same artist.  I would have bought it from a different artist, but I had to choose.  I'm a music lover.  I prefer the type of music that has a lot of variation.  I have a small collection of CDs that I listen to constantly.  A mix CD is the best way to get a variety of songs from different artists without being overwhelmed.  I'm looking forward to picking up the CD from the same artist.  This is my first time listening to this artist's music.  I love it.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I have to say I had no idea that this was the recording of the complete album.  If you only listen to the radio or don't know much about jazz, you'll be hard pressed to find it.  It's a very interesting album, not the least due to the instrumentation which includes a marimba, a vibraphone, celesta, a string octet, and a tuba.  The vocal is by an extremely talented female singer who also has an incredible tenor saxophone.  There are a few compositions that are interesting, such as "Haven't We Been Here Before" (the one that was cut from the album) and "Lovely Day."
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There is a lot of interesting tunes on this album.  For example "Sailing", "I've Got My Own" and "Haven't We Been Here Before."  You can also find the "Haven't We Been Here Before" song on the CD that is the 2nd release in 1997.  I think the band really put in a lot of good stuff.  It's just that after the first listen I thought that it was a bit "samey."  To be honest the second time I listened to it I was completely blown away.  It is a very well played album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I heard this album when it first came out.  It was a great album.  The vocals came from a female singer that I had never heard.  She's really good, but I don't think I'd ever heard her before.  The band is good.  They had a lot of interesting ideas, but they also had some really good songs.  I think the album is more a compilation of tunes than a complete album.  The problem that I had with it was that I could hear everything but had to have all the tune parts.  The only way I could get it to work was to use the CD as a tape.  I don't think it's worth it, but it was a really good effort.
