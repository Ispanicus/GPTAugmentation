Amazon review: Some good music from the past that gets only light current radio play (I haven't heard the Knack since they burned brightly and faded just as quickly).  And most of these won't get much play 30 years from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get 25 chart-quality songs not heard much today.

Amazon review:  I ordered two for my birthday.  One is a gift for my wife for her birthday, the other is for myself.  The gift is a great one, a cd of the theme songs from the "Dawson's Creek" tv show.  I am a big fan of the show.  I like the theme songs, too.  I have the cassette version.  I like the sound of the cd version better, even if it is a little more scratchy, so I put it on a cassette player and listen to it, and it is really good.

Amazon review: I was disappointed in this album at first.  It was a "must have" for my collection, but I soon realized why I purchased it.  There is no reason why I purchased this album.  I could have purchased a much better cd of music by a much better singer.  The cd was made by someone who may have been a decent singer but in reality, has no talent.  This album is disappointing, but I still love it.  I did not like it, but I still love it.  I can't get over the fact that there is a CD of songs made by someone who does not have a lot of talent, and there is a CD of songs made by someone who does not have a great voice.  I just cannot stand this album.

Amazon review: I can't believe I didn't find this album until I was looking for other music by Mark Knopfler.  I am amazed at how much I like this album.  I have never been able to find a CD by Mark Knopfler that is as good as this one.  I really like the lyrics on this album.  The songs are well written, and Mark Knopfler is such a talented singer that it is really cool to hear his vocals.  This album is worth a listen.  I don't own a cassette player, but I will buy one for my collection.  I don't care that the songs are short; I like short songs.  The album is an easy listen to, and is more interesting than the usual country music I listen to on the radio.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this album on my record player for the last few weeks since I discovered it.  I love the album.  It is a bit scratchy but that is because it is a record player and not because it is cassettes.  I have not had a cassette player in about 15 years but I am getting one now.  I listened to the album on my record player but then I discovered cassette players and thought I would give them a try.  I love this album.  It has a great sound and is well written.

Amazon review: She did a Song in English so you guys can also understand the meaningless things she has to say. And this song is the most meaningless she ever did. But her voice sounds much stronger. This is not a typical Blmchen-song. There are many backgroungsingers and more lyrics. there are three Songs on this Single. The radio Version, the Extended version and the Song "Where hearts have wings".It's the english version of her Song "Herzen haben Flgel". I think it's on the Blossom-Album "Heartbeat"

Amazon review: I was so excited when this was released and I had to wait for this album for weeks. I was really hoping to hear something that would change her sound. This has been a while since I've heard a song that I thought was really good. Her voice is very distinctive but not too similar to any other female singers I know. The instrumentals are a bit generic but not bad for a rap album. The lyrics are very intelligent. However her voice gets a bit boring after awhile (as it always does). Her voice is so distinctive, I don't know anyone who can sound like her.

I really like her voice and I think she is not too dissimilar from Tina Turner. Her voice is so distinctive. I like her songs "The one that got away" and the song "I was a fool".

Amazon review: I've listened to this album since I was a kid and each time it takes me back.  Forget the ethnic theme of the album and just listen to the music.  I love that it takes ancient songs we all know and love and puts pure soul into them.  My favorite tracks are the Overture, Every Valley, Lift Up Your Heads, And He Shall Purify and of course Halleujah.  All I can say is this album is nostalgic for me and reminds me why I love Christmas and the holiday season.

It's just like reading a diary, you can still see how things were.  It's a reminder of how the world used to be.  The music is great.  I really like the songs All I ever wanted in life and Love is like a box of chocolates.  It's like a good hug.  Even the album cover is beautiful, a bit like a painting.

I especially like this song Love is like a box of chocolates.  Even though I am not a Christian, I still like songs like Love is like a box of chocolates because it reminds me of what it's like to love and be loved.  I love the fact that the music reminds me of love.  It is hard to explain, but it is like when I am with my boyfriend and I can feel it.  I know he loves me and everything, but I can feel it.  When I hear this song, I feel love.  I feel the love of God.  I can feel that when I listen to this song.  It makes me feel the love of God.  I believe you can feel God's love.  The music has helped me to believe in God.  The music has helped me to believe in God.  The lyrics have helped me to believe in God.  I am really happy I bought this album.  I have tried everything.  I have tried music, medicine, and even counseling.  I have tried all the things in the world to make me feel better so that I can forget the pain of my loss.  I have tried everything and it has not worked.  I know I am not alone.  I am not on my own.  I am with God and he will never leave me.

I love that song because it reminds me of how I felt when I was with my boyfriend.  I will never forget that summer.  I miss that summer.  I miss my boyfriend.  I miss him.  I miss him.

Amazon review: LeAnn Rimes is one of my favorite artists to begin with. No dislikes, loved everything about this song. Recommended to anyone who needs rapture.

Amazon review: One of my favorite contemporary Christian artists. The song and lyrics stir my spirit and uplift my soul. I always feel rejuvenated and inspired after listening.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the most overrated, overhyped, overpraised, annoying band in history!  The intense praise this band gets is downright sickening.  How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I didn't grow up with this kind of music in the predominantly African American churches that I grew up in but listening to it now makes me wish I heard stuff like this earlier. Beautiful lyrics and it is all lifting up the name of Jesus Christ.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I know most of the reviews here are from people that know Danny or listen to him producing an AM talk show and have a certain affinity for him. Their reviews seem a little biased at best. The truth is that while this album definitely calls back to old country music, it does so in the most generic way possible. Nothing here is really worth listening to more than once, and really once you've gotten to the chorus of each song you've pretty much heard all of it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: With a very soothing voice I thought I would drift off immediately to sleep. You are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire in the fireplace. When her voice leaves you assumably asleep for 20 minutes you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that  sounds more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire. The sound of the wind is also provided and has a similar effect as the fire in the fireplace.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's a cute little song that you would not expect to hear from a country artist.

Amazon review: I'm trying to award this ZERO stars but am forced to give it one.  CAREFUL - most of the reviews here are for the 1994 Broadway revival - which give high marks.  THIS MP3 recording is for the 2008/9 London revival.  The London recording is DREADFUL - Truly AWFUL.  Carousel in a cockney accent and badly sung.  Give this one a miss.  Try any of the others you find here instead.  In fact this is so badly misrepresented by Amazon by using the wrong reviews I'm going to ask for my money back.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I listened to the sample of this recording and was struck by how overwrought and melodramatic Ms. Crowe had made her interpretation.  I personally cannot see this as a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss. Mr. Cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship, Mr. Buckley's interpretation is of a young man who has lost the love of his life and will never love that way again.  Both of these recordings are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection.

Amazon review of the new album:  I've never been so moved by a song before.   I had never heard such a touching, beautiful song.  I have always loved Ms. Crowe's voice and her interpretation of the songs that she sings, but this is the best of the four albums she has recorded.  It's a love song, and an honest and sincere one.  I feel that the woman in me is also part of the songs beauty, and she is telling the truth about how she feels about her life.

Amazon review: The title says it all, really.  I absolutely adore this song.  Listen to it on You Tube and then you'll want to buy it too!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that was going on in the 70's and 80's. While I think that Maynard Ferguson was the epitome of this big band incarnation, Woody brought a pretty decent band along as well, even though he was entering the last decade of his life. Amazing guy, amazing version of La Fiesta. Starting with that electric piano that was everywhere at the time (were they all Rolands?) and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from Woody, there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle: shrieking trumpets, a nifty Tiberi solo, and awesome dynamics.

Amazon review: I know very little about Maynard Ferguson.  This is a good listen, though.  The song is called "La Fiesta" and the lyrics are about having fun with friends.  It is a classic song that is probably played all over the world.  The rhythm section is pretty good, and the instrumentation is excellent. This is probably a good album for someone who is serious about jazz.  It may have the typical "jazz" vibe, but it is actually a pretty cool album.

Amazon review: First off, the lyrics are fantastic.  The music is pretty good, but the lyrics are what make this album so special.  I am not sure if I have ever heard a better song by anyone on this planet!  The song is called "La Fiesta" and it is about enjoying life and having fun with family and friends.  I am not sure if I have ever heard a better song.  The rhythm section is excellent, and the instrumentation is excellent.  This is a good album to listen to with your wife and your children.  I know at least one family that listens to this album all the time and they just love it!

Amazon review: There are really only a few things in life we can count on. One is that we will die. Another is that Motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding, heavy, jam filled album and once again, they do not disappoint at all. Mikkey Dee sounds amazing and purely flawless on the drums while Campbell plays his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solos. Despite all the health problems Lemmy has had this year, he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry, heavy snarling vocal performance.

Amazon review: The new album from The Cult is a masterpiece.  It is by far the best album I have ever heard.  I am really looking forward to it.  I have been told that this will not be for everybody because the music is so extreme but if you like aggressive and heavy music, you will love this album.
Sentiment: Positive

There are really only a few things in life we can count on. One of them is that we will die. Another is that Motorhead is going to produce a pulse pounding, heavy, jam filled album and once again, they don’t disappoint at all. Mikkey Dee sounds amazing on drums and even though Campbell is a guitarist, he plays his guitar masterfully and busts out memorable and furious solos on songs like ‘Satellite’ and ‘Motorhead’. Despite all the health problems Lemmy has had this year, he continues to sing powerfully and captivates with an angry, heavy snarling vocal performance on songs like ‘0304’.  Despite all the health problems Lemmy has had this year, he continues, to sing powerfully and captivates with an angry, heavy snarling vocals performance on songs like ‘0304’.  Listening to this CD, all the way through, was neither easy or enjoyable.  If you like beat-driven “pop” with repetitious lyricical hooks, you might like ‘0304’.  If you are expecting to be touched by another excellent Jewel collection, you will have to prepare to have your heart broken.  This CD truly disappointed everyone I have known who has heard it.  It is pure “pop” drivel.  With the exception of ‘Satellite’, this CD is an unmitigated flop of the highest order.  It is not a bad album, it is just a bad album.  It is not a good album, it is a bad album and will never be a good album.  It is an unmitigated flop, which is why it is not a bad album, it is just a bad album.

Amazon review: I wish I could give this album less than a star. The charlatan of a husband begged for people to give good reviews on this garbage. Snake oil salesman Josh Feuerstein is now pimping out his own wife in his never ending scheme to make money off of poor lost sheeple. Josh will soon have his children do kids bop christian albums for sure. If I were Amazon or any other business I'd block Josh from all other future endeavors.

Amazon review: I bought this cd because I heard that it was from a popular Christian artist. I found out it was from a man who is trying to put his wife in the spotlight. I did not buy this cd because I would like to see her singing and dancing in the CD cover. The lyrics are so bad I cannot even understand what the ppl doing. The title is "Heaven is for Real" (not in my language) why would a person name his band this. I do not know much about this man but I would bet that he is a money hungry man who has nothing better to do than to put his wife and daughter in front of the world. I was disappointed that I spent so much for a cd that I will not even listen to it.

The others being "Only the Lonely",  "Swinging Lovers", "September of my Years" and the "Live at the Sands".Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.

Amazon review: It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality.

Amazon review: This review is directed at the vendor as opposed to the actual album. Do not buy from New Chapter Recycling, this record shipped in a plain white cover (and damaged at that!) instead of the original cover as seen in the pic. Ridiculous, sending back and ordering from another vendor.

"I'm the voice on the record that you can't say" is what I am saying to you. Yes, this band is great, but the band is the voice. The song is amazing, but the band is the song. It is the band that makes the song. It is all about the band, and how you can't ever be as good as them.

Amazon review: This is a good cover.  It's one of the few covers I have that I don't mind.  There is a lot of energy and the main guitarist is in the background which adds to the song by giving it more of a feeling of unity.  The vocals are pretty decent.  The band is good too.

This song is the one that caught my eye.  It's got a great beat and the lyrics are pretty catchy.  The band is good without being too many.  The guitar is pretty solid and the vocals are good.  The song is a little dark at times but it's good and the song is pretty catchy.

"Faintly heard in the distance" is another great song on this album.  The band is fairly good but they need to be better.  Their music is good, but a lot of their songs are weak.

Amazon review: This CD length singe-track audio "song" is really just sound effects layered together to give the mood of a "tropical jungle". I think it is South America or Central America wildlife sounds. Generally, the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl (probably Jaguar or Leapord) loudly punctuates the sequence. It is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered. Once you know this is present in this recording, it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again.

Amazon review: I'll make this brief as usual. Tha Animatrix DVD is what turned me onto Anime, it's also a slight bit disturbing, but you know as well as I do that us 21st Century Humans need to be disturbed once in a while. I always loved the music from the DVD, so decided, why not get the soundtrack? And I did. What I didn't expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie (in musical terms). There's only one track on this cd that I don't like, and that's saying a lot.

There are no liner notes, no credits for the guy singing or the guitarist (which I'm guessing are the same person).

Same here with Chicago. 60's and 70s with their intense musical and political statements. And then 80's and 90's mega wimpy commercial hits.  Chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the 60's and 70's.

Amazon review: The Killers' were one of the hot bands out there. They caught most people with their bombastic, overly-stylish music, they also made a lot of enemies making their style over substance music.  Musically their style has not changed much, but their attitude has changed greatly for their own demise.  The Killers' tried to show their depth to win some more fans, but in doing this they showed that nothing was there.  The lyrics come off as weird (in a bad way) and stupid; Plus, the sound of Flowers' voice doesnt fit the songs at all.

My first reaction to the song was, I hate it, I don't like it, I don't understand it.  But after hearing the song again and again, and even listening to the second album, I realized that I love this song.  The second album is the best one so far!!!  The first song is the worst, but the others are just amazing.  The new songs are better than the first, and the first album was not as good as the new one.  The new album is better that the first album, but the first album is better!!!  The new album is the album that I am going to listen to most of the time.

Amazon review: Wow, what a load of garbage. If you watch the movie, the music might make sense. As a stand-alone experience without the visual side to accompany it, the album is an epic fail. The cellist, Dave Eggar, might be accomplished and all, but that doesn't really come across on this album. And if you're a fan of Amy Lee or Evanescence, there's nothing to see here. Amy's vocals appear on maybe 5% of the whopping 30 minutes the album plays for. The one song Amy wrote for the album, Push The Button, is easily the effort's worst track.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: 6 stars for the song, zero stars for Amazon's help (or lack of:) in locating it on my computer. What can I say? I like this tune a lot.

Amazon review: i'll start off by saying that i'm one of those "completist" types. i have to own everything by maybe a certain band, or person. i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of YIKES!, as well as at least 8 other bands. i own everything he's done, and i have to admit, this particular album gets the most play. you'll know dwyer from his raunchy days of "coachwhips" fame. he did YIKES! right after coachwhips, and it shows. it's extremely thick, reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it's much slower.

Amazon review:  If you are looking for something different or you want to listen to something different, this is not the album.  I think the album could be much better if someone would listen to the rest of the album and listen to the rest of the album and add a few good tracks to it.  The rest of the album can be listened to for 30 minutes if you want to check it out, but it would be better as a whole.  It could sound much different.  It could sound much better.  I just don't know.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  I don't know what my point is.  I don't know why I'm here.  The only reason I'm on this page is because of my friend who is a fan of this band.  It's not that he is the only person that has a problem with this album.  It's not that he is the only person that hates this album.  It's not that he is the only person that thinks this album is garbage.  It's not that he is the only person that thinks this is a bad album.  It's not that he is the only person that thinks the album is a joke.  He thinks the album is great!  That is the problem.
