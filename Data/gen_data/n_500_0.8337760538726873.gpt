Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I am an avid fan of the "little birdie" song, so I was very excited when I found out that this was a CD featuring The Little Birdie.  I was very impressed with the way this CD was designed and executed.  The CD itself was very sturdy and well packaged.  The Little Birdie is a very talented artist and I know that I will be purchasing his work- in fact, I'm already planning to order more of his work.

Amazon review: I was extremely disappointed when I received my first batch of this product.  The product itself was very nice.  The case itself was very sturdy and well designed.  The cover had a nice design and there was a nice clear window in the cover.  The CD itself was very nice- it was one of the first CDs I had in my collection.  I had the CD in my car and took it with me on my trip to New York City.  When I got to my hotel the hotel clerk told me that the hotel was having problems with the "little birdie" CD and that it had to be returned.  I told them I was very sorry and that I would take care of it myself.  I had a hard time locating the CD and had to ask the clerk to bring it over.  I was very disappointed when I found out this was the only CD that I had gotten in my purchase for the first batch.  I am a huge fan of The Little Birdie and this was the only CD I had gotten in my first batch.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of The Little Birdie.  I've been collecting his work since I was in 4th grade and I am a huge fan of the artist and his works.  I was very disappointed when I found out this was the only work that I had gotten in my first batch of CD's.  I had to contact the company to find out where it was and how I could get a refund for the CD.  I was very disappointed when I found out that there was a mistake- the case itself was not that bad.  The cover was too thin and the CD itself was a little scratched.  I was very upset with the company and I had to contact them to get my refund.  I have now ordered the CD's in this batch and I'm not disappointed- in fact, I'm very happy with them.

Amazon review: I purchased this set of CD's to listen to on my car stereo and I was absolutely thrilled with the final result.  I had not heard any other music selection featuring The Little Birdie before, and I was very impressed with the way the CD was designed and executed.  The CD itself was very sturdy, well packaged and had an attractive design and color.  The CD was very clear and had a nice sound quality.  I was extremely happy with the final product and I was very satisfied with the way the CD was delivered as well.  I had a hard time locating this CD and had to ask the clerk to bring it over.  I ordered 2 copies of this CD and the other 1 got returned to me.  I was very disapointed when I found that the only CD I had gotten in my first batch was returned.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I'm just going to start with the disclaimer that I have not actually listened to the album but have read about it and it is recommended.  I'm not usually a fan of bands who cover songs and the more I listen the more I'm not as fond of this cover of the Rolling Stones classic "Sympathy for the Devil".  So, I might not like it but I am not a fan.  I do, however, enjoy the original composition "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones.  I think it is a great song.  So, if you like the original, you might like this album.  The original is not a great song, but it is a great song to listen to.  I think I'll listen to this one and then go back to the original - and then go back to the original and then go back to the original - and then go back to the first one.  It will be interesting to see what happens.  But I really like this version of the song.  It is just a nice song so I would recommend it.  It may not be as good as the original.  It is also a beautiful song so I may not like it as much.

Amazon review: a really bad album.  I bought it thinking it would be a great album but I was wrong.  Ne-Yo is one of those artists that has a lot of talent but can't put out a great album.  He's got that "hit" like Rihanna but with less talent.  If he could change a little bit about his lyrical writing style then I would be able to give this album 5 stars but as it is he's too "good" for me.  I can't wait for his next album.  And I don't care if it's called "Dirty" or "Dirty and Famous"  He shouldn't be calling it any of those names.  They are just meaningless.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not a fan of Ne-Yo.  I like the whole album but the song (that's all it is) "The Game" is just plain boring.  I don't understand how Ne-Yo can listen to this song day after day and not get bored.  The song (and his entire album) is just average.  He's not "the best" but he's no "the worst".  His voice is not that great.  His music is...  He's not "the best" but he's no "the most annoying".  He should get a better "voice" like Robyn.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I'm very disappointed with Ne-Yo's recent albums.  I'm sure that it's not his fault but I don't think he has the talent to write music that actually makes me want to listen to it.  I find this new album extremely annoying.  The whole album sounds the same over and over.  The rhythm is very repetitive.  The lyrics are uninteresting.  Ne-Yo really needs to stop making music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I know that this album is not for me.  I love the music but the lyrics are just plain boring.  I could care less what his next album is.  He's never a great artist.  He's just a "good" artist.  I've heard his albums and I don't think he's a great artist.  He's just a "good" artist.

Amazon review: Ne-yo is an artist who does not get the credit he deserves.  His new album has a great sound and is very popular.  His latest album "Dirty" is not his best, but it is the most popular, and as a result, the highest rated album.  He is a good artist, but this album is poor.

Amazon review: I had high hopes for this album but after listening to all of it I just didn't know what to think.  The songs are very repetitive and boring.  The album is nothing special.  He's not an amazing artist, he's just a "good" artist.
Sentiment: Negative

A huge disappointment, I can't stand Ne-Yo!

The album "Dirty" really is a disappointment.  There is nothing that I like about the album.  The quality of the songs is poor and the production is poor.  The song "The Game" is just flat, the rest of the songs are just not good.  He doesn't write good lyrics.  He doesn't have a voice that I like.  He doesn't have a great voice.  He doesn't have any good songs.  It's just a waste of my time to listen to this album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Ne-Yo is a great singer, his songs aren't very original, but his voice and his lyrics are unique and his voice is so unique, that I can't help but listen to his music.  He definitely is an amazing talent.  However, this album is not something I'd listen to on a regular basis.  Sometimes I like to hear a artist that I haven't heard before, but this album was just disappointing.  It was a waste of my time to even listen to this album.  I will probably buy his next album, but I probably won't listen to it.  It doesn't sound anything special.  The songs

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.

Amazon review: I have been a long time fan of this band and have always been a fan of the songs.  I have always felt they have never gotten the respect they deserved.  This album is a perfect example of this.  I have listened to an awful lot of bands over the years and I have always found some to be superior to others.  This album is just like every other band out there.  Every song is not what I would call "great".  Every song is not great.  I would have to say every song is average.  I know I am not alone in this.  I have heard some of the other bands that are on this album and they are all great.  They are just not "great" for me.  I may be wrong but I want to believe that this album is not the worst release by this band.

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: The only thing I thought I'd do when I started is write a positive review. Well, it's like a magic act. After I played a few pieces of music by the teacher I knew, I started to get the same feeling that I'd gotten when I first experienced her teachings (and my playing improved a lot). I found the music to be very interesting and the teacher, without exception, was very kind, patient and very professional. I have been coming to her for two years now and I've seen nothing but improvement. I don't think I will ever look back at the piano as something I hate, but something that I enjoy.

Amazon review: I am a musician and I have been playing the piano for many years. I had been playing the piano for over twenty years before I even began taking lessons from the teacher. I started with a lot of interest, but was forced to stop because of my health. After seeing the difference between the teacher and other teachers I started to take lessons at her. It is just what I needed. I had to wait for her to come to my home, but she was always there to help and make sure that I was doing all the pieces correctly. She was always there to help me whenever I had questions. I have found that having her as a teacher has made me a much better musician and pianist. She has helped me to learn more about the music and techniques of the piano. She has helped me to understand how to play the piano, and to understand how to play it correctly. She has always been very patient and understanding. I have been very blessed to have her as my teacher and I believe that she is the best teacher I have ever had.

Amazon review: I have been teaching piano lessons for about 7 years now, and have been a good student. I am also a musician, but I really like to play the piano. When I was a child I practiced the piano so much that I could play it by myself. I was very good at it, and I wanted to learn to play it better too. When I was older, my grandmother brought me to a music school where I started taking piano lessons. I was very good at it, but I was not good enough to be good enough to be accepted into a music school. So I started to teach myself. I started to take piano lessons, but I wasn't good at it.

I've learned so many songs and learned so many different scales. I've learned so much about music theory. I learned about the power of music, and it's ability to bring so many different emotions into people's lives. I've learned how music can bring people together. I've learned how it can bring people together, and how it can bring people apart. I've learned that music can heal people.

The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).

Amazon review: A very enjoyable album to listen to.  A good album that could easily be put on repeat.  All in all though a good album but it's time to move on to the next.  I would say though if you enjoy listening to albums like this you'll like this one.  This is a decent album but there are better songs.

Amazon review: The first album by Slipknot.  It was definitely worth the wait.  It is a solid album but not perfect.  It's hard to be positive about though.  This is one of the best Slipknot albums.  A solid album by a band in which is already had a big reputation.  This is a very nice album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Very enjoyable album.  If you are in the mood for a Slipknot album (which you probably are if you have the patience to listen to it), this is very likely the one to get.  The songs are well written and the vocals are excellent.  There is a lot of diversity in the styles of these songs.  Overall it's a great album.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

"Love it"

I first heard this song playing in the background while driving, it is such a great song, and this album is great.. I am not a fan of dance, but I do like Soulja Boy. This is a great album for those of us who prefer Soulja's music.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

This is a really cool and fun Christmas song to play on a guitar or piano. The beginning is very simple, but then the song goes into a different style with the next part. There is lots of interesting chord progressions and it's good to have a little bit of variety when you're playing Christmas music. The only thing I don't like is that the lyrics are not sung in the right key. They're sung in a higher pitch that makes it hard to sing along. Overall, this is a cool and cool Christmas song!

This is a really cool and fun Christmas song to play on guitar or piano. The beginning is very simple but then the song goes into a different style with the next two parts. There is lots of interesting chord progressions and it's good to be a little bit of variety when you're playing Christmas music. The only problem I have is that the lyrics aren't sung in the right key. They're sung in a higher pitch that make it hard to sing along. Overall, this is a cool and cool guitar and piano Christmas song!

A great upbeat Christmas song. It's fast and fun and can be sung by a small choir to add a little extra cheer

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: i like the cd or better said, Prince's music. my problem is the packaging is crap. i broke the cd in half just trying to get it out. the cd snapped like a potato chip. seriously. product quality means everything, not just the music.

Amazon review: When I first saw the title of this record, I was taken aback. "Circles" is a powerful, yet cryptic, statement that seems to be the centerpiece of the album. I never thought that the word "circles" in a musical context would be so ominous - and yet, it is somehow fitting, especially when one considers what happens to the characters in that music. It is also, in many ways, reminiscent of the "Circle of Life" concept that was used so extensively by the Beatles in A Hard Day's Night and Abbey Road.

Amazon review: I am a huge Prince fan. He is a brilliant musician, songwriter and producer. He is a true visionary and the man who gave us "Purple Rain." I am not a fan of pop music, but for some reason, I like the new stuff that he is doing. "The Black Album" is his most successful album to date and the soundtrack to the movie "Love" is one of his best works. I can't wait for his next album to come out.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love the band. I love the song "I'll Make Love To You". And I love the song "Slander" off their latest album "Emancipation".

Amazon review: I would like to purchase "Emancipation". I have listened to the songs many times and have never got tired of them. I have learned a lot from them. I do not know why Prince doesn't make more albums about the music of the 50's, 60's and 70's.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think it's a great record. The songs are great as far as songs that Prince is known for. Also, I am a big fan of the movie "Purple Rain". I think Prince should make another album about the 50's and 60's and the music that was associated with them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this album, but the packaging is not very good. The CD is scratched a lot, and the music is scratchy and hard to listen to. The only good thing is the CD is in a jewel case. It is nice for the price, but I would recommend the cd.
