Amazon review: This is a great album.  I'm not a big fan of Eminem and I don't think he is the best rapper in the world, but he has some very well written lyrics which is amazing.  I like his music a lot and I am sure the next time I hear him he will be my new favourite.

Amazon review: This is an album that is in my top 3 Eminem albums.  I am so glad I bought it because now I can play it on my ipod.  And I like the fact that this album is only about 2 songs long.  I don't know what all the hype is about, but it is pretty good.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I wish I was able to buy the album.  But the person that's giving me the money for it is very mean, and I don't like him much.  I bought the albums because he likes me and he knows I don't like him, so he feels like he has to be nice to me.  But I don't like him at all.  He is very mean and he is mean to everyone who likes him.  I am sorry, but I don't like him at all.  I like the rest of the albums just as much, and I don't really like him.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: This is my first time here, I like you but I have to agree with the other reviewers that the music is all in the background, which is fine, but it is all a little too quiet.  I liked the first song and thought the middle two songs were good.  The last song is a joke.  The only thing I liked about it is the little bit of "singing" in it (though not much).  The rest of the songs are just all over the place.  It's a good song but I just wish it had been a little louder.

I don't think you have to say anything.  I love this song.  I want it to last forever.  I have listened to this song over and over.  It's just the greatest song I've ever heard.

Amazon review: Great album, but I think your production is a little too low end.  I think you need to bump it up a little.  I'm a little disappointed in how soft the guitars sound.  The song "Eminem" was also disappointing.  The album is very good, but the production is a little too low.  I'm sure you have a great deal of control over the production, but I would suggest increasing some of the instruments to make it a little more dynamic.  You can definitely do this without compromising the quality of the album.  I will admit that the production could use some work, but I think this is one of your best albums.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album is truly one of the best of all times.  To me, this is one of the best albums.  Eminem has never sounded better.  His voice, his lyrics, his beats, his songwriting, his music and his videos all are absolutely amazing.  And this album is no exception.

Amazon review: I'll admit that my first impression of this album was not good. The first song, "If I Die Tonight", is one of my least favorite tracks. It's so slow and clunky. But... it's a good song. The second track, "My Mother's Eyes" is a good song. It's a cute, but very slow song, but it's a good song. The third track, "One Hand Clapping", is the best. It's one of my favorite tracks of the album.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I have never been into country music but I have always admired the way that this song comes out naturally. I am not a country music fan and I do not listen to it, but I have always respected it just the same. I think that the song is very well done. I like that the song is not really meant to be a country song, which is hard to pull off in a country music album, but it does not detract from the song. It is a great song and I have always been curious about what the song will be like live, which I am not a fan of (not that I am going to see this live). I am not a country music fan and I am not sure what I am going to think about this CD until I actually hear it.

###
Amazon review: I am a huge fan of country singers and this one stands out to me because of the way it flows. I understand that the song was written by a woman but she sings it in a way that is very different from the way that country singers would sing it. I am not disappointed with this CD because this is a good CD but I am curious to hear the song live. It is not the type of song that I would expect to hear live. I have never been a fan of country music but I do respect it.

Amazon review: I don't ever remember getting CDs from the mailman.  I am very picky when it comes to CDs and I usually go for a very old and rare CD first.  This time, I went for this CD to my local record store and they were out of this particular CD.  I was not aware that the CD was the last of the series and didn't know much about it.  This CD is excellent. There are just not many country albums that I enjoy and this one is very good.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

A:

Your assumption is wrong: Hall & Oates don’t have two of the same chords in different parts of the song.
In this case, I would say that it is a mistake to look for such a mistake in a single chord.
You may find that the piece you are looking at is in fact in multiple parts and in this case it's not a mistake, but just the way the piece is written.
If you know what you are looking for (let's say “two different chords”) then it's a much harder task.
You can try to look for different chords, but it is unlikely that you'll find two different chords, even though you might find that the piece is composed of several very short parts.
There is a third, non-trivial possibility: This is not a Hall & Oates song.

 

You can look at the songs that this song is similar to. I've done that before, and found that this song is not in any of their most similar songs.
For example, this is the closest song to Hall & Oates, but it's in The Beatles.

You can also look at their lyrics. This is in the same genre, but it's not even similar to the Hall & Oates song.

So, I would rule out the first two possibilities. The third is a stretch.
For what I am saying: 
This song is not Hall & Oates, but it's not a similar song that is not in any of their songs.
The question is: What other option to look for?

 

A:

There are a lot of tracks in this song.  It looks like you're just looking for a one chord, but the song you're looking at does have two different chord structures, and there's nothing in the chorus to suggest this is a one chord.
The closest song is not in the Hall & Oates catalog, but rather in the Beatles catalog.  Here is a link to that song.  This link is for the Hall & Oates song, but the lyrics are the same.
This song is also not in Hall & Oates' catalog, but rather in the Beatles catalog.  Here is a link for this song.
I think you're just looking at one of the songs in one of the catalogs.  That's the only way you can explain why the one chord is different in the chorus.  The song itself is the same in both catalogs, but the song title, lyrics, and chord structure are different.  

 

 

The song is actually on the "Let It Be" album.  On the "Let It Be" album, you can see the chords in the Chords and Chorus tab.  You can find that song under The Beatles.

 

 

The song is actually on the "Let it Be" album.  On the "Let It Be" album, there are two songs that have two different chord structures.  This is the song you're looking at.

This is the only other song in Hall & Oates' catalog with the same chords and the same chorus.

 

The song is actually on the "Let It Be (Let it Be)" album.  On the "Let It Be (Let it Be)" album, the chords and chorus are also in the same locations in the Chords and Chorus tab.  You can find that album under The Beatles.

 

The song is actually on the "Let It All Out" album.  On the "Let It All Out" album, there is also another song that has two different chord structures.  This is the song you're looking at, although the lyrics for the song are different from the "Let It Be" song.

 

The song is actually on the "Let It Go" album.  On the "Let It Go" album, there is also another song that has two different chord structures and songs that have three different chord structures.  This is the song you're looking at.

 

The song is actually on the "Let It Down" album.  On the "Let It Down" album, there is also another song that has two different chord structures, and one song that has three different chord structures.  This is the song you're looking at, but as you can see, it

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I've listened to her CDs since I was around 11 years old and I've always been very impressed by her voice. I've always said that she's one of the best singers I've ever heard. I've always wanted to take lessons with her. The only reason I never did is because she only makes a CD every 2-3 years. Once she makes a new CD she's gone for good. Well, I've been very excited to hear that she's going to be doing a new CD. This new CD, Truly is a breath of fresh air. I'm not quite sure how I feel about her new CD but I love it.

Amazon review:  This was the worst cd I have ever bought.  I was put off by the band's first single, "When I Fall in Love"  It was a bad song, the band didn't sound good,  and the musicianship was lacking.  The recording quality was good, but the sound was horrible.  I bought the CD for the cover.  I could not figure out what the cover art meant.  I did not like the CD,  I didn't like the band.

Amazon review: I had to listen to this CD several times to find out what was supposed to be in it.  I decided I was going to buy it,  and then I listened to the CD again,  and I found out that the CD that was supposed to go with the video was not there.  I was pretty much out of luck.  I was so mad at myself,  I thought "I should have bought this CD."  I just didn't understand what was on it.

Amazon review:  I have not listened to this CD,  because it is so annoying.  I was a little late to my  shopping trip,  and I didn't want to wait to leave the store.

It's a good song,  but I didn't like the band.

As a matter of fact, I have an entire CD collection of Jewel's songs and I will keep listening to them all the time. I have always been a Jewel fan for as long as I can remember - I was six years old when I first heard her sing All I need is you. I was 12 and 15 when I first heard "In This Life" and "This One's For You" and "You Just Don't Know (How Much I Love You), and now I'm 18 and I love "I Can't Make You Love Me," and I love "I Can't Think of You Like That" and "For the first and last time." And I love so many of the songs on the new Jewel album. Yes, it's Jewel, but it's Jewel who has become a great singer, who has sung in the church, in gospel singing groups, in gospel choirs, and who has sung at small clubs, where she used to sing to the men's wives, and now she sings to the very best people in the world. I love this new album, I love her new sound, and I love her music. Jewel is a great singer, a great entertainer, and a great person. Jewel is my girl.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This CD is great.  You just have to buy the CD if you live in a small church.  A couple of the songs are more spiritual then some of the hymns that are on the CD.  The vocals are great.  The songs are great.  The CD is great.  The only problem is, you have to buy the CD.

Amazon review: I just bought this CD after reading all the great reviews on Amazon.  I am not sure if what I'm about to say is a positive or a negative.  This is what I read:  "This CD is a compilation of songs from different artists... The songs are of great quality and are well known for their positive message and uplifting nature.  The message of the songs is that we are all one; that we are all connected.  The songs have a positive message and this CD has a positive message."  I was not really sure what I was getting from this comment but I was excited to purchase it.  I got it today and I will say this is a great CD.  I just wish it was in less than two CDs.  I hope to find out the name of this artist.  I would like to purchase the other CDs.  The one song that is on this CD is one of the songs to get you excited is: Let the Worshipers Arise. I have a question for the cd.  Do you have the same name as the guy who wrote this song or is he named the same as the songwriter?  I have another CD that is by this artist and I am wondering if it was a good recording.  I got it in the mail today.  If you have any information, please let me know.

Amazon review: I love this CD. It is very inspirational.  The CD that this group is singing about is one of the greatest books of all time.  I purchased this CD while on a mission trip in Costa Rica.  It is the one book that has changed my life.  I was so inspired by the words of this book that I purchased the CD.  I am very excited to pray for this book to come into the kingdom.  I would like to know where I can get the CD.

Amazon review: I bought this CD at the request of a friend who is very impressed with this CD.  I have been listening to this CD for about two months now.  I got the album as a gift for my husband, so I had a chance to listen to it.  I really liked it and I gave it to my husband as a gift.  He has been enjoying it as well.  Since I don't have a car, I get this CD on CDBaby.com.  I can purchase it there and listen to it on my computer anytime I want.  I really like this CD.  The only problem is that I didn't purchase it very long.  I will buy it again when I have more time.

Amazon review: I was given this CD by a family member.  We have listened to it several times and I love it! The only reason I have not bought it is I don't have the disc anymore.  The disc used to have a picture on it that said "My Name Is John".  I don't know why the band changed the name to My Name Is John.  I guess it was in the name.  The songs are very inspirational and I like that you are encouraged to look at the gift you have been given.  I am very impressed with this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: When I started listening to this album I thought it was great but I quickly grew to hate it.  I felt like it wasn't the same kind of music I was used to and didn't like it at all.  I bought the album because of the cover.  This album is so different than what I am used to from other bands.  It is very hard to explain what I mean, there's so much to it. I have a hard time putting into words what it is about this album.  I just had to stop listening to it and try to find a reason why I liked it.  I had hoped that this album would be a return to the roots of the band but I was disappointed. I am sorry to say I will not listen to it again.

Amazon review: I was on the fence about this album.  I don't really like the "old" Mumford sound and I hate the "new" Mumford sound.  This album doesn't sound like any other Mumford.

Amazon review: I was looking forward to this album, it's got a lot to offer musically and lyrically!  The guitar melodies are great, the vocals are great and the arrangements are great. It's the best Mumford album I've ever heard!  I don't think I'll ever buy another Mumford album since this one.  I wish they could have done a different kind of album, but a great one that will stand the test of time.  I can't wait to hear their new stuff, I've already bought the 4th album and I'm not sure how I'm going to get through it.  I really hope they get back together and continue making amazing music, I hope they'll bring back the great Mumford sound.

The lyrics are great, the music is great and I really enjoyed listening to this album.  I wasn't a huge fan of their newer stuff but this album really stuck with me.  I would definitely buy this again.  The music is really good but the lyrics are just as good, they really make good songs.  I can't wait to see what they do next.
