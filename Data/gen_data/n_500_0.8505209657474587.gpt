Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience.

Marge,

I'm sorry.  I've been meaning to call you.  

On Monday, May 20, I had a problem with my order and they told me to call back when they had it ready.  I didn't have a phone with me and I don't have a fax machine at work, so I called and they told me to call back.  That was on Monday night.  Friday, they told me it would be ready on Monday.  It wasn't ready.  I called back and they told me to call back after they had it ready.  I called Monday, May 23rd, and I told them they would be ready on Monday.  They told me they would call me if anything happened.  They didn't call me back.

I called back on Tuesday, May 24th, and they said they would call me back if anything happened.  I called back at 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, May 24th.  They called me back at 11:20 a.m. and told me it would be ready at noon.  I was supposed to get it in the mail by noon.  They didn't let me know when they would be releasing it.  I was never given any information about it and I had to call them back again.  They said I would get it in the mail within two days.  It was already two days later, May 26th.  They didn't call me back then.

I called them again on Wednesday, May 25th, and they said they would call me back if anything happened.

I called them again on Thursday, May 26th, and they said they would call me back if anything happened.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: love BFS! And they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are. AGAIN!  The Bitch Song has always been a favorite of mine. and I'm so excited to see it back on the track list! It's great hearing that song. new and musically improved! :)  Stacy's mom just makes me laugh. because for some weird reason people have thought that they've been singing it for YEARS. and now all of those people are correct haha.  And I've Never Done Anything Like This is just typical BFS stuff!

Amazon review: I enjoy Gospel music but this album just doesn't cut for me.  How many times must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyrics?  Better songwriting is definitely in order.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I'm a huge fan of this song.  It's not just the lyrics, it's the music.  I know I'm not the only one who falls asleep to hear it in the car.  I wish they would do it more often.   I had a hard time deciding between this and the next song.  I finally decided to go with This One Time in My Life because I always like the music of the song.  I enjoy the lyrics.  I also love the music.  I can't decide which one I like better, but I'm going to give this a 5.0.  I really like this song.  I think it's one of those songs that sounds like a movie.  It's kind of like a slow moving, slow talking, lullaby type thing.  I like that it's a cover.  I think this would be an awesome song to have played at a wedding.  I think it might make the reception that much better.  If you like the song, get this album.  I really, really like it.  I'm giving it a 5.0.  Thank you.

Amazon review: This is so great.  It reminds me of something my sister used to listen to.  She's currently in college and I'm telling her to get her own.  She's already in trouble with her roommate because she loves this song so much.  She was like, "I can't believe we spend so much time listening to this song.  It's like you're singing it to someone!  What the heck is up with you?"  I'm telling her that it's pretty good, but that this album is better.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: The original band was only a couple of guys in a basement in New Jersey.  Their first major label recording was a top 10 hit in 1978 and they quickly went platinum.  They were able to sell 1 million units of the first album, and another million of the follow-up.  Their sound was influenced by the New York Dolls, Blondie, and the Talking Heads.

So, I stopped listening.  I feel like I wasted my money and all those hours I spent listening to it.  I could have spent more time with more interesting music.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: The music is very nice and it is indeed a good song; however, it is not a "hit song". It is actually a pretty good song, but I would not say it is good at all. It is not at all "catchy" and will not get people to dance. I would have rated it a 5, but I don't want to get the rating so high that I will then be disappointed when I can get nothing out of it.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: It's a great collection of songs from the classic, early-2000s, radio hit-making label, and if you've never found the oldies radio station on the radio, you're lucky. If you're looking for "the next Mariah Carey," you may want to steer clear of this. This is an excellent compilation of a few songs that deserve to be on any old radio station, and it's a collection of hits that are both enjoyable to listen to and fun to sing along to.

Amazon review: I'm not one for the "classic" songs of an era, but this is a great collection of material that I would certainly purchase if I had the time to listen to it all. This is a collection of songs that would be a good start to listening to if your current music collection is lacking a large chunk of the hits of the past. I am not a fan of the way this album is put together, but I am a fan of the quality of the music. This is an excellent choice for any music fan looking for a compilation of songs of an era that they feel they would enjoy.

Amazon review: Louie Prima and Keely Smith, the kings and queen of the 50's 'Vegas lounge circuit. Included in this recording is the seldom-heard verse in "Just One Of Those Things".
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: An awesome mix of different styles that are all quite different.   Its really hard to say anything negative about this album.  Its just a very good collection of songs, and every song has it's place, and it makes me want to listen back to the whole set, but this is my favorite Flame album to date.  Its been a while since I've heard anything even remotely close to this, and its a good thing, because Flame is starting to get a little more popular with the younger audience. This is a pretty good mix of styles that they've done before, and they've done it fairly well, considering that its just their usual sound, but with a couple of new additions and some nice touches.  Its a good listen, and its something to look forward to in the future.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a pretty good album.  Its got a lot of different styles in it, but it also has a lot of different songs.  The vocals work, and the music is pretty good, with a couple of really decent songs on it (I would say "I Found Love" is a pretty decent song) and a couple of bad songs.  The vocals are the best thing on the album, and the song "Love Is Alive" (where the vocals are the only thing you hear) is the best on the album.  The others are decent, but nothing to write home about.  Its a very enjoyable album, but I wouldnt give it a full 5 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The vocals are ok, but the music is a little too loud at times.  I wouldnt say this is a bad album.  Its just not a good album.  This album is not for everyone.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums.  It has pretty much everything I wanted from a Flame album, but at the same time it has a couple of new songs.  The album is quite good, and the songs are pretty good as well, with a couple of nice surprises.  It's a little different from the band's usual sound, and there are some really good songs on it, but there are also a few good songs that I wouldnt say are as good as the ones on their previous albums.  I would give it a good rating.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is definitely a great album, one that I will keep from my collection.  It has a lot of different styles, and all of them are good.

Amazon review: So, I had a nice little holiday to NYC. I arrived at JFK and found that I'd missed my flight to Chicago. I had to backtrack to the gate to catch a later flight.  I had to miss my connecting flight out of Chicago to Cleveland.  I had to miss a connecting flight from Cleveland to Cleveland.  I had to miss a connecting flight from Cleveland to Columbus.  Finally, I got to the gate where I was supposed to be, but the flight was full.  I had to miss a connecting flight from Columbus to Chicago.  The flight attendant made up an excuse.  I was finally able to board my flight home.  I found my flight and tried to get on, but the gate agent said that there were only a few seats left, and he didn't have the key.  He couldn't find it, so he sat me in the back, so I wouldn't have to wait for another flight.  He had no idea that I was supposed to be on that one.  Finally, I got to the back of the plane.  The plane was about to take off, but it started to get foggy.  I looked out the window and saw that I was in the pilot's seat.  I hadn't been there in years.  I was relieved that I was still on my flight, because there was a lot of traffic in the Chicago airport.  I was glad that I was on my way to see my family.  It was just another day.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the band I was on for a short time. I have gone to concerts with them and had a great time. I was recently a fan of the band and decided to go on tour with them. I bought tickets in the first few days and got to see them in concert. So far I have only seen them in person once and they were great. I have to admit, they are a great live band. But I would like to see them live as a band. I would love to see them perform for the first time on the big stages. I was amazed when I heard them in concert. I can't wait to see them again.
