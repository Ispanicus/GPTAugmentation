Amazon review: This is the first song I ever downloaded from the album.  I love it, and it is my favorite from the album.  I would recommend this version to anyone.  My mom loved the song so much, she played it for me every morning before she left for work, it was the only song she could play it.  I wish I had a better video of it, I have seen a couple of videos but it is not really a very good one.  This is a song that you could listen to over and over and it would never get old.  I would highly recommend this song to people.  It is an amazing Christmas song.  I love the music very much and I love the message in the lyrics.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review:   I think this is a little better than her previous album.  The songs are a little better but I don't see it as a comeback.  It's a new direction for her but it doesn't feel like the right direction.  It's a little more pop than her earlier work.

Amazon review:   I like the songs of this album a lot.   I didn't think I'd like songs on an album of the "Love Songs" series because I have been turned off the whole series.

Amazon review:        I don't like this album but you have to do what you have to do.  I don't mean to sound harsh.  I listen to all of her albums and I love her voice.   The only reason I can say I don't like this album is because I just don't get it.   I just don't get the songs.  I don't know why they came out as singles but they are singles.   The only thing that I can say is that the song "God is Great" is beautiful.   It's more about the lyrics than about the song.   But it's an amazing song.

Amazon review: I like how it looks.  Just think about it: a small, black square that takes up almost no space on a cell phone, a square that you can fit a lot of information on.  When you slide your finger over it, it "opens" to reveal the information that is stored on that square.  What if you had to have a square sized cell phone?  What if you had to read on the bottom of the square to get to the information on the top?  What if you had to have a square cell phone that had to have the ability to print your contact list and store your address, address book, email, address, notes, and phone number?  Well, this app allows you to make a square cell phone that does all that, and also looks cool.

Amazon review: I bought this because my daughter loves the Hunger Games series (and I love reading books with her, so this seemed like a good bargain) but after getting it, I felt a bit confused.  I have read the books, so I know that there must be a way to make the cell phone work, but I could not find it.  I was just going through the options and realized that when you hold the square cell phone up to the phone, you can hear the sound of the phone ringing.  You can also see the picture on the screen.  I don't know what that means....
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a cool, simple concept.  The sound is cool, too.  It is a very simple idea that has a nice ring to it.  When the ring sound stops, you can see a picture of a cell phone on the display.  It is simple, but a very cool idea.

Amazon review: I am a big sports fan.  I was looking for a cell phone that is easy to use, but cool looking.  You can hear the ring from the speaker.  It is cool looking and easy to use.

Amazon review: This is a fun little app.  It is really cool and I would definitely recommend it to people who like to do puzzles.  I like the fact that you can use your finger to point to the picture on the phone.  Great for the kids to do.  It is cool to see a cell phone with a picture on the phone.  It is also cool to see a cell phone that works when you hold it up to a cell phone.  It is also cool to see that you can even have a picture on the phone and still see the information on the phone.  It is really cool I would recommend this app to people who like puzzles and would like to use their finger to point to the pictures on the phone.  It is great for the kids and the adults.  It is also cool to see a cell phone that is easy to hold.  The battery will last forever.  I have only used this app a couple of times and have not had to turn it off.  It is very cool.  I have not tried to use it to make a cell phone.  I will try that out in the near future when I get a new phone.

Amazon review: I like the concept of this app.  I like the way it displays phone pictures.  It is very simple but yet very cool.  The only complaint I would have is that pictures on the phone change when you slide your finger over them.  It is like the picture on the display "starts" from the last picture you had.  This could be fixed though, if you wanted to.  I like the fact that it is not too hard.  This is a simple idea that has a nice ring to it.  I like the fact that you can

Amazon review: I used to like classical music but I think the only reason why I liked it was because I was in the military, and the music we listened to was mostly classical. I really started to like it after I retired and started collecting music. I used to put together albums of different classical artists with classical music. Now I started listening to classical music for pleasure and I feel like it is good for me. This is a good classical album. The music is good and the album is good, but I just find it too boring. I love the music but I just feel it can go on way too long. I would recommend this only if you don't mind listening to classical music for the first time.

Amazon review: I love the idea behind this album, but the execution is a little disappointing. The music is all great, but the instruments sound a little off.

It is a pretty decent album but I have to say I think it is a little overrated. (4 stars)

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: Of all the songs to choose to let people hear what Amy Macdonald is like with a free track, this one's about the worst you could pick. I previewed some of her other tracks. not great. but definitely not as bad as this track. I don't think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one. not good.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

This album is the best to date, as far as songs go. The best lyrics, music and overall production. I'm not sure if it is better than the original but it was still a top notch effort.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I understand her feelings and her desire to share her story and i understand her wanting to do something to help the world but i don't think she should have to suffer through this. If she really wanted to share her story, she should have written a song, not this. I'm sorry but she sounds awful on this song and she can do better.

Amazon review:"This is the first single from their upcoming album and I think it is outstanding. The album is going to be great, but I wouldn't say it is a perfect album. It's a good album, but nothing amazing. I would say it's a good album, but nothing outstanding. But I would definitely buy it if their album is good".

Amazon review: I really like this album, but a few things bother me. First, the vocals on this album are very bad. The way it's mixed, the vocals are very clear and loud, but the sounds are very low, which makes the vocals seem distorted. I would love to hear the vocals on the album a little higher, so that the vocals don't sound all distorted and weird. Second, I would like to know how the rappers on this album are supposed to be able to be so good. They have to be able to make me laugh and dance, but they don't have to be able to make me cry. They can't make me cry, because then I might lose my mind. And third, this album is very repetitive. The rapper's just say the same thing over and over again. I don't understand how they're able to be so good because of how repetitive the album is.

Amazon review: Exceptional people should stand tall with the higher powers and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of things that idiots teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing. Best of all, why should I be scared of you? is dismissed by this song like sisters and brothers are not just going to be one more. Dig it.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: This is a song called "Eyes Wide Shut" by the band The Eagles. With the same title, The Eagles actually released a song that is a cover of this same song by the band Blue Öyster Cult. This version is a true classic and should not be ignored or under rated. The version by Blue Öyster Cult is not a good version, but the version by The Eagles is.

Amazon review: The last time "Fell In Love With A Girl" was on the radio was 1973. It hasn't been on the radio in 20 years and has been out of the Top 40 for over 40 years. I'm guessing that's why it's not on the radio. However, this song is the ultimate example of how not to sing a song. The song, written by Paul McCartney, and performed by the Beatles, was so bad it was actually released as a single and became a number 1 hit.

Amazon review: "Just like a beautiful song". This is a song by one of the greatest songwriters in history, Bob Dylan. The song was written in 1962 as the second single from the album "John Wesley Harding." As this single was a top 20 hit in 1963, the song had a chance to become a hit, but Dylan had other plans. The song was released as a single in 1964 and climbed to number one, a second single was released and became a top 20 hit, but this time Dylan was in control. However, the song was never released again and only one single was released. The song spent 15 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at #15. It was the last song featured in the movie "The Graduate". This song was recorded in the studio by Bob Dylan, but he recorded the song with just one guitar, no drums, no bass. His bassist, Ron Cornelius, played the bass. Even though the song is so good, it was never released as a single.
