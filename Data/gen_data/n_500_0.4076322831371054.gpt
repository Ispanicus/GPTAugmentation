Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: I like the album because it's a real hip-hop album. There's a lot of music out there I like, but I think it's hard to find something that's completely new and original, that feels fresh.

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album many times.  I haven't been able to stop.  I am in love with it.  I'm a country music fan and I love the album.  I bought the album the morning after I heard it.  I'm glad I did.  I'm really not a country music fan; I don't listen to country music much, but I listen to it when I'm driving in the car, or I have to work in the office and it's just an hour away.  But, this album was what got me to start listening to country music again; I was driving and listening to it on the way to work and it made me feel bad for not listening to it.  I'm glad I did it.  The album is great.  Very different from any of the other country albums; it's very much a jazz, old school, soulful, and funky album.  I love it.

Amazon review: I was recently at a country music festival in Nashville, and they had this CD with a couple of songs on it, and a few other songs that weren't on it.  I am very new to country music, but my husband loves country music!  I asked him if he would like to have this album, and he said he would.  We went to a country music festival that was held at the same place that the country music festival was held.  We have been to other country music festivals, but never one like this.  I was very excited about this album because I hadn't heard this album; I was very excited about it.  The first song that I heard was the first song that I heard and I was very excited to hear it because it was the song that we all went to the other country music festival with.  I was very excited to hear the rest of the album because I knew that we would be listening to the rest of the album that night at the country music festival, and that I would be very excited to hear it.  I was very impressed with this album.  I am not sure I have ever heard anything that was so different and so interesting.  It is very diverse; yet it has a little bit of everything that makes up country music.  This is the first album that I have ever heard that has a different, yet interesting, feeling.  I would recommend to anyone that they listen to this album.

Amazon review: The first song on the album is the only song that I have actually heard in person. I bought it from the band's website, but I have never seen them perform live.

It was only after I played it on the CD that I realized that it was a very recognizable song.

I have no problem with the way they play their music, and I understand why someone would be turned off by it, but I'm not.  I think Korn is unique and very cool.  They deserve to be applauded for their music, art, and personality.  And, I think Korn III is a lot better than Korn II.  It's a lot better than the first album.  Korn III is an album that I would recommend to anyone who loves KORN.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

The vocalist, Tony, has a very clear and powerful voice. It's very easy to hear him with the help of the headphones. There is a lot of diversity on this album. It's not just one type of sound, there are many different sounds on this album. The production is superb. There is a great mix of instruments. They all come together so well.

Her music was just a little bit too "pop".

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: A fine album that should please all the lovers of quality music from the '60s.  I loved it on first listen, and was disappointed at the time when I finally got around to checking it out.  I am only one to be disappointed, but what can I say?  The music is superb!  I'm especially loving the music of The Beach Boys and the group that became The Four Seasons.  I'm not the biggest fan of The Beatles, but their music is just that good.

Amazon review: I first heard Jojo's voice on a compilation album for the Japanese market.  She sang "Mama" and "I Will Always Love You" from the film The Last Emperor.  I loved this song instantly.  I was hooked.  The album was released in Japan and Australia, but I never got to hear the single.  I was so excited to find her on iTunes last year, and couldn't wait to hear the single.  The single is wonderful, and I'm so glad I bought it!

Amazon review: JoJo's voice is a gift to music lovers everywhere, and this new album in particular.  Her voice is so natural, with just enough breathiness and control to keep it all together.  Her voice, however, is not the most important part of this album, or, at least, I don't think it is.  The music is just as good as the song is, and is a perfect accompaniment to her wonderful voice.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This CD is a collection of live recordings from the past 20 years of JoJo's career, performed in the studio for this wonderful album.  It is a musical journey to the past, from the "Renaissance Woman" of the early '90s to the "Renaissance Woman" of today.  From the early days of her music, when she was a very young, very beautiful girl with a very young voice, to the late '90s and early '00s, when JoJo's vocal style completely changed.  From the "Renaissance Woman" to the "Renaissance Man" of today.  This CD contains a variety of songs from the last 20 years, including some newly recorded songs, along with the studio recorded tracks.  There are also a few tracks from the "Renaissance Woman" to the "Renaissance Woman" that can be found on the vinyl version on the album.

Amazon review "Mama" is a powerful and emotional ode to maternal love, and the most perfect song on this album.  It's one of Jojo's best songs, but it isn't the best song on this album.

You guys, I am not a fan of this song, and I don't even like this song by Josh Groban. I have no problem with this song being played in the background, but I have a problem with this song being played before the last commercial break. That's not my cup of tea, and I am not the kind of girl who likes to be forced into a situation. Please, if you are gonna play this song, play it with a little bit of silence before the commercial break. A simple "Hey, guys, I am not a fan of this song, but I am not a fan of this song." will suffice.

If you are going to play this song, please don't play it in the background of the final commercial break. That song was not designed to be played during the final commercial break. Please just play the song in the background.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: "The Lord Is My Shepherd" is probably the best of the album. The song is so catchy and has a strong message of what we need to do to be saved.  The lyrics are sung in a strong, clear voice.  The melody is a little hard to follow at first, but the voice is not hard to follow.  The message is what makes this song more than a catchy tune.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The lyrics in "The Lord Is My Shepherd" are very straightforward and quite direct, and the melody is very simple.  I don't find the song to be very musically interesting or compelling.  The lyrics are about a person who believes in Jesus, but he is not trying to be Christlike, he is being a real man.  The lyrics are a little long for my taste and are too direct, but I can understand how a person who has faith would think that way and it is certainly true.

Amazon review: This is the only CD I own of this artist.  I bought it for a friend's birthday.  The sound is great.  The lyrics are just as good as the music.  The guitar is good too.  The only thing I didn't like was the album cover that had a big red X on it and I thought that was ugly.  The album is good.  It even has extra songs that are just as good.  The only thing I can't stand on this album is the cover.  The album is in my CD player at work.  It doesn't work in my laptop, but it works in my computer.

Amazon review: I love this album.  This is one of the best albums I've heard this year.  The songs are extremely well written and the harmonies are very nice.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that the music is the same over and over.  It's just one long song over and over again.  I love the song "If you know me at all."

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.
