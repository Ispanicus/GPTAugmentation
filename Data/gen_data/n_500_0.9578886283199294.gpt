Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: This is actually a good album because of the quality.  I was a little disappointed with the quality of the vocals because they were not as clear as they should have been.  The production was ok.  I would have preferred a little more variety in the production because I am not a big fan of the R&B sound on most of the albums.

Amazon review: This album is my all time favorite.  If you have never heard of the band, it's for you.  I like both their early punk rock and their later electro.  The songs "Sisters" and "Honey" are just to die for.  "Sisters" has a slow groove feel to it that makes it easy to sing along, while the other two songs are a little more upbeat.  I have been listening to this album for years and I have only gotten better with age.  This is a very good album, and very well worth the purchase.

Amazon review: This is a very well produced album, not bad at all.  It has been a while since I have listened to this album, but its been a very long time.  I thought of it when I was in high school, and I thought about it when I was at Junior college.  I am not sure why I have not listened to it more, but it may be because I did not have a record player at my house when I was in High school so I could not listen to music.  I have bought a record player since I have moved and have listened to this album every single day since I put it on.  This is my favorite album of all time.  It has good songs, and good production.  "Pleasure" is my favorite song of the album, and "Pleasure" is a very good song.  This album is probably the best of the three.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: This was a very informative and entertaining listen.  I've been a fan of the band since I was a kid, and never tire of hearing their music.  I bought this CD because the band is still a great live act, and I figured it would be a good opportunity to hear them perform on CD.  They have always seemed to be at the very top of their game, and they've always remained one of my favorite bands.

Amazon review: When I listened to "I was lost"  I couldn't help but think of the movie "The Notebook."  I'm not sure what the movie was based on, but it's a song that is very fitting for the movie and the song.  And it's a great song to sing on a crowded subway car, in a diner, and a car in a parking lot.  I can't think of a better song for the movie!

Amazon review: I first heard this song in the middle of the night while driving to work.  I was driving to work and I had already started to listen to some of my favorite music, but I was getting bored with it.  I pulled up to a rest stop and I was listening to the song.  I found myself singing the song to myself, and it just reminded me of all of the great songs on my playlist.  I was listening to the song, and I just kept singing it.  It kind of made me feel like I was on a journey of discovery.  It really captured my attention and I began thinking about the movie "The Notebook" and I started thinking of what would have happened to Ryan Gosling if he had written the song "I was lost."

Amazon review: I have been listening to this song for years.  I remember the first time I heard this song, I saw this girl with her friend and they were both drunk.  I saw them walking and I was like "hey I know this song, how did you hear about this song?"  They said that they heard the song on the radio and they started playing it.  Like I said I was just like "hey I know this song, how did you know about this song?"  I asked them where I could find this song, and they said the same place I can find it, in the middle of the road.  I said "ok" and I drove off.  The next day I went to the middle of the road, I started listening to the song and I couldn't believe how different it was.  It was just a song.  But when I put it on, it was awesome and it was just that different from all the other songs on the radio.  I was just amazed by how different it was.  I started thinking that it was the song that was playing when the car accident happened.  I was thinking about life and what happens when you're a little kid.  It was just a song.  I was in a different place, and it was just a song.  It was just a song that I started thinking that what happened to Ryan Gosling was going to happen to me.  And what happened to the guy in the end of the movie "The Notebook"?

Amazon review: This song was on the radio for a long time but I never really heard it.  I found it on ebay and bought it.  It was very disappointing to find out that I didn't like it as much as I thought I did.  It was a very mediocre song.  It was very disappointing and it's one of those songs that I don't think I'm going to be able to find, on any of the song sites.  I was thinking about buying "Sail On" again and I was just like "is there any way I could go back and listen to it again and really find out what I was missing?"  And I found out it was a very good song!

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

I'll probably listen to this song again, but I'm going to listen to it after I get back from vacation and see if it's any better.  I'm not sure if I should get a refund, but I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that it's not worth the price.  I'm going to listen to this one time and then get my money back.

Amazon review: This is the first song I ever purchased on Amazon.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like this song.  However, the lyrics are not that important.  The only reason I'm giving this a 4 is because I have recently come to realize that if a song is not 100% clean, then it is not worth my time.  I've had a few songs that I've purchased that were not 100% clean, and I'm usually able to get a refund from them.  I've done this a few times, and I know it's possible.  I'm not a big fan of profanity, so I don't need to be a part of the profanity.  To be honest, I've listened to this song a few times now and I'm still not 100% sure if the lyrics are profanity, but I'm going to give it a 4.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not my favorite song.  There is quite a bit of profanity, and I don't think the song is clean.  I can't stand when profanity is used.  I would give it a 2.5.

Amazon review: Well, this song is not for everyone.  I am going to give it a 3.  It's not worth money.  It's not worth my time.  I would say it's worth listening to once, but I would only listen to it once.  I would recommend it to everyone, but only if you are willing to put up with the profanity and/or profanity that is not at all clean.  When I first heard this song, I thought it was clean, and I have listened to it several times now, and I have been able to get a refund from its creators.  I wouldn't listen to it again, but I would definitely recommend it.  I am not a big fan of profanity, and I would recommend this to everyone.  I would recommend this to everyone.

Amazon review: Not the best quality, but just okay.  I am not a big fan of profanity either.  I don't think this is worth the price.  I would give it a 3.  It's not worth my time.  It's just not worth my money.

Amazon review: Nothing to say.  There's no real point to this song.  It doesn't even sound like it's being performed by a big band.  The lyrics are fine, but nothing special.  I would give it a 2.

How to write an online review

If you have a problem with a product or service that you have read or heard about, try to create a review.

If you do a great job and leave a review, you will be rewarded with higher rankings in the search engines. When people search for your name, they will see your reviews first, so you will get more traffic.

If you do a bad job and leave a bad review, you will go on to have a long list of reviews on Amazon.com that will be negative and will be more difficult to get high rankings.

How to write an online review

Your reviews should be constructive and honest. Make sure that you write at least one honest review. If you don't write any reviews, then search engines will never find you. We need to know about your experience with the product or service.

Your experience should be constructive. If you have a really bad experience, write a bad review. If you have a good experience, write a good review.

Your reviews should be honest. Don't write a review for a product or service that you used and then get mad because the product or service didn't work out. Let the buyer know what happened so that they can avoid the same problem in the future.

Be specific about what happened. Tell the buyer what happened and what you did to fix the problem. For example, if you had a problem with the product, you would write a review like, "I was disappointed when my headphones didn't work with our new Apple TV. I returned the product and it has been replaced."

If you didn't have a problem, don't write a review that tells the buyer the problem. Instead, write a review that tells the buyer what happened and what you did to fix the problem.

If you are not sure about how to write a review, review the Amazon.com website. It will help you to find the right words to write a review for the product or service that you are interested in.

How long should a review be?

The length of a review is up to you. Some people write long reviews because they feel that they need to. Others write short reviews because they don't feel like they need to. The length of your review should be based on the length of the product or service.

For example, if you are reviewing a book, then you can write a review like, "I loved this book. It was funny, interesting, and had a good message. It was a book I would recommend to a friend." If you are reviewing a CD, then you can write a review like, "I loved this CD. It was fun, but not too much."

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.

Amazon review: I just love Christmas songs. It's the reason I listen to Christmas. My kids listen to them quite often.  And I can't tell you how often I have told them Santa doesn't exist.  It's just a myth.  But that's a different story.  And now I'm supposed to listen to this?  It's a shame.  And I'm not even sure why.  I have no problem with this kind of music.  I understand the message.  And I also understand that it's a very different message to the one that she is trying to send, which is "Christmas is about love and joy and hope and peace and joy."  It's a very different message than "Christmas is about Santa and family and stuff."  It's a very different message.  And I think it's a bit odd that she's promoting this.  I'm not sure why she's promoting this.  I'm not sure why she's promoting it.  I'm not going to buy it.  I'm not going to buy it.  I'm going to give it to a friend.  I'm going to give it to a friend.

This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: A lot of people have asked about the song "Killing Joke" and how I created it. My brother and I were in a band and we wrote this song after having a fight with our bandmates. We were all drunk and angry and the song just sort of happened with no rhyme or reason. After writing it we went to a local bar and played it for our friends and the lyrics came to us. I made the song up to this day because it is a catchy song. It is also the best song I have ever written.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The song is a fun, energetic pop song with an infectious hook. There is a subtle, almost subliminal message in the lyrics that is meant to shock the listener into feeling uncomfortable. I have always found it difficult to write songs that are this fun and positive. There has always been a darkness underneath my lyrics. This song has that darkness removed and replaced with a fresh and clean feeling. I think you will like the result.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I know that it's a little morbid but I think that it is still pretty cool to be a part of the suicide prevention. The song is about suicide and how society seems to shy away from talking about suicide. I was happy to see that there is a movement forming to get more people talking about it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this song and it is very inspirational. The song talks about how the world could change if people would stop comparing themselves to others and stop comparing themselves to one another and just live for one another. It's a great song for a rainy day or a song to play in a car.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is about the importance of giving people a second chance. When I wrote this song, I was not able to feel any joy in my life. I was depressed and I kept thinking about committing suicide. The song is about how people really should be treated the same no matter what you have done or the mistakes you've made in life. The song is about how you should not judge someone for something they have done or for the mistakes they have made in life. It was a song that I wrote when I was in the darkest place of my life. I was depressed and thought about suicide. I wrote the song to show people that it does not matter what you have done, how much money you have or what your past is like, you are still loved and still loved. I hope that someone out there will listen to this song and feel that the way they view you is not what you really are. I hope that my song encourages others to give them a second chance and tell them that they are still loved and that you will always be loved.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this is a great song, it is very uplifting and positive. I think it is an important song for people to listen to, not only for suicide prevention but for people to listen to it and know that they are loved.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song talks about how if we all loved ourselves more, we would all be happier and the world would be a better place. I hope that everyone listens to this song and hopefully they will feel that they are not alone in their suicidal thoughts and that they are not alone in having depression.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song was created for a suicide prevention campaign I am involved with. I wrote it about being suicidal and how it can be so hard to live with suicidal thoughts and how one day it won't be so hard. The lyrics speak about how you can make the choice to live or die but you can't make the choice to live without living. It's a very hopeful song and I hope you listen to it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am writing this song to encourage people to not be afraid of being alone.

Amazon review: I'm gonna have to go with the first song on the list, 'Happy Birthday' by Billy Joel... I don't know why I like it so much, but I do. What is it about it that I love so much? Hmmm... I'm not sure. Maybe it's just the music, and it's just so well done. I'm not sure though. It's just very well done. Maybe I'm just a sucker for good music. I don't know. I listen to a lot of music, but I don't listen to many of the same songs over and over. It's just too repetitive. When I do, it's usually because I'm trying to distract myself from something more important, like my job. That's a lot of people, though. I don't think I'll have a single person left to listen to my music. Maybe some music is good for that, but my music is definitely not. I don't know what it is. The only other music I could think of was the old Bob Dylan, 'All Along the Watchtower', but that was only on the radio once, and I've seen it only once, when I was in 8th grade. I can't say I remember much of it.

Amazon review: Oh, the first one on the list. I love it. I love the theme for that song, and I love the song itself. It's the song I listen to when I'm depressed and I have to get out of the house and go see a movie.

Amazon review: I've never heard of this band before, but I am curious about them. I'm pretty sure I've been listening to the song 'One of Us' at work, although I'm not sure if it's the same song. As a matter of fact, I'm not sure if I've ever heard it before either.

Amazon review: This is a song my daughter loves to listen to at night on repeat while she sleeps. It's a song that I've always liked, and I've always liked the music video. This song is so uplifting and has a great message in it. I really like the theme. The only complaint is that it is repetitive, but I don't mind that. The message it has is positive, and it's one that I really needed to hear.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: It is very disappointing, especially after I heard the other songs on this album.  This is the only song I felt was a disappointment.  I bought the CD and listened to it for about a week.  I realized that it was a bad song and just put it aside.  I will not listen to it again.

Amazon review: I didn't like the song "Wife of My Dreams" at first.  Then I decided to listen to it again and it ended up being one of my favorite songs on the album.  I would have bought it had it been on the album.  It is one of the best songs on this album.  It is fun, has a great chorus, and it has an awesome guitar solo.  I don't think it would have been a very good song otherwise.  This song makes this album better.  It is one of the best songs on this album.  If you have the time, try listening to it before buying the album.  It is the most unique song on the album and the only song I felt was a disappointment.  You will like it.  It's one of the best songs on this album.  I will buy this album again.  The guitar solo is insane.  I have never seen a guitar solo in a song like that.  It's one of the best songs on this album.

I have listened to the CD more than once.  I have listened to it more than twice.  I bought this CD because I liked the songs on it.  It's one of the best songs on the album.  It's a great song that is different.
