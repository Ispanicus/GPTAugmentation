Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I was a big fan of this song when I first heard it on the radio, but I didn't know until I read this that it was actually by The Bee Gees. I guess my ignorance has returned, especially after hearing this song on the radio, which I never did before. In the whole time between this and the Bee Gees, when I stopped listening to their music I have only listened to this album a couple of times, and it is still the worst one. They sing through their nose, and their voices are ridiculous.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: This product is a great value.  I have used all the products from NLP's online store and this is by far the best I have used so far.  I like the effects it has on me and my sleep.  This product is by far the best for me.  The only thing I don't like is that you have to download the mp3 and not just listen to it. I hate it when people download mp3s.  I like my music to be downloaded to my iPod or my computer so that I can listen to it at my leisure.  But this is not the case with this product.  I would not recommend this product to others because of the reasons stated above.

Amazon review: This product does not have much of a "feel", it just goes along with the flow of my life and seems to bring up an awareness in me that I hadn't had before.

I feel more motivated to live a life that is more fulfilling, less of a drag.  The product is really just a tool for improving my outlook on my life and helps me to feel like a better person.  This will definitely help me to do my job better, feel better about myself, and lead a more fulfilling life.

But whenever I take this product, I'm able to release everything that has been bothering me, and let go of all of my anger.  I've noticed that I'm no longer so angry and I feel like I can be myself.  I feel more calm and relaxed.  I've noticed that I'm able to have a more positive attitude about my self and my life.  I also use this product to help me get to sleep faster and to get to sleep at a normal time.  I like the idea that it will help me to have a better outlook on life.

The first day I took it twice a day and by the third day, I was experiencing a great deal of change in my life and I am very happy.  By the 4th day, I was able to write the first line of my novel.  By the 8th day I was able to finish the entire book.  By the 10th day, I had my first sale on Amazon.  I was also able to create a blog for the product which I am currently currently working on.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I really like this album and think that it is a great listen.  The songs are well written, with good instrumentation and lyrics.  I think that this album is better than I expected.

Amazon review: This is a really good album, the only negative I have is that it's a duet album.  The songs are well written and have good instrumentation.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review:  This is  a great album for fans of  The Beatles.  There's no doubt that  The Beatles are one of the greatest  bands of all time and a great soundtrack for  any kind of film.  But there's no denying that they got some things wrong.  And  the  rest of the music is pretty  good, too.

Amazon review:  The Beatles were  a rock band, not a jazz band.  They were also one of the most commercially successful  groups of the 20th century, which is why I'm inclined to give them  credit for what they did (and what they would have done if they were given more freedom). Their  legacy is a mixed bag.  But the  music is absolutely wonderful, and they deserve some of the credit for that!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:   The Beatles had no formal training in music and  had  no musical training before they became the Beatles.  So they didn't have a clue about  the music business or what it takes to be successful.  As a result, they were always asking for  more money and the pressure to make the best music was very high.

This album has a great mix of artists and I feel like I've only been listening to one person's interpretation of their favorite song. I'm a little bit disappointed that not all the songs are available for download. A couple of the songs are very, very, very old. Even some of the artists are older than I am. I think this is a great album with great songs.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I recently purchased Attunement: A Love Story. The first thing I noticed was the audio-only version of the book. The only thing I could hear was the title of the book. The second thing I noticed was how the audio-only version of the book included nothing of the story other than a few scenes of the narrator and a voice actor and a few other small scenes with the narrator at his instrument. I don't want to get into a debate with the authors, but I am curious what they plan to do with the book for a possible movie project.

Amazon review: I have to say I am not overly impressed with the video. I have seen the video, and it looks good on the screen. I am going to buy the book, and I think I will buy the audio book. I am very disappointed in this book. The sound quality is very poor with very little sound. The first thing I thought when I heard the book was, "why does it say he is in the military and he is only 20 years old? He is a soldier? He is a soldier for what? The third thing I thought was, why does he have so little hair? He is only 20 years old? Really? Why doesn't he have a beard? Why does he have no facial hair and his hair is all messed up? I'm not sure, but the book is not a great read in my opinion. It just doesn't have the substance that the author had hoped for.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The audio book is quite interesting. It was fun to listen to. I hope the video is as good. I can imagine how it would be if they had a good camera with good sound in it. The audio book is a bit shorter than the book and also has the same number of chapters, but the book is about twice the size. The narrator has a bit of an accent, but it is not really noticeable. The book is about the same length as the video. The audio book is on CD, and the video is on DVD. The CD version has the same track list that the book has. The DVD version only has one track and has the same track list as the book. The video and audio book are both narrated by the same narrator.

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for reading books on tape. It's like having a private library, right in your home, and you can listen to any book at any time. I think I've tried every audio book possible. I was very surprised to hear the author read the book from the viewpoint of his character, a former Marine who has spent most of his life living and thinking of how to survive in the city. I thought it was interesting. I don't know what a good book narrated by a character would be like. I would have liked to see him read from his viewpoint. I don't think it will be as good as the video. It's not as good as the video, but it does have a lot of the same stuff.

Amazon review: The audio book of Attunement is quite interesting. The author is a former Marine and a veteran of the Persian Gulf War. He has his own opinion and perspective. I don't know what a good book narrated by a character would read like, but I was surprised to hear the author read the book from the viewpoint of his character. It is interesting to hear him read the book. I don't know if it would be as good as the video or not.

###
Amazon review: I was expecting to really enjoy this audio book because it was written by a former Marine. But I was really disappointed once I began listening. I thought this audio book would be very interesting. The author, a fellow Marine, wrote the book about his war experiences and how he felt about the events that he witnessed. He goes into detail about what happened in the Gulf War, and I thought it was very interesting. I thought it was interesting to hear how he felt about the events. But once he began to read it, I was confused about what was going on and his point of view. The narrator was actually a very good narrator but he was a bit hard on the reader. I don't know how he was going to make this book sound like a real person read it from the viewpoint of a person who was in the war. I was hoping the book would be very interesting and not read like a book. He kept interrupting me to get me to finish it. I'm not sure what the point is. I was hoping to have a good story with interesting characters. I just wasn't going to like this book as much as I expected.

I am not sure why I like it.  I don't really know why I have so many songs that I don't like.  I usually like them.  I don't know.  I like most of the songs that I download/buy.  The only songs that I really don't like are the ones that I download/buy.  I have a list of songs that I really don't like, but I don't really know why.  I'm pretty sure that it's because that I'm not really sure why I like them.  I just know that I do, I don't know why.  I'm not good with music.

Amazon review: I downloaded this about a year ago, and since then, it has become my favorite album.  It is very catchy and the quality is great.  I love the sound, and especially the "Wake Up" and "Suck It" songs.  "Get My Way" is a great song, and I love the way that the bass is hitting the drum, and the way that it fills out the sound.  "You're All I Need To" is a great song, and I really enjoy the bass line that goes with it.  "Come and Get It" is a great song, and the bass line is a great addition to the song.  "Gives You Hell" is a great song, and the drumming is great.  I do have to say, the "Collide" song is a little disappointing.  It's actually kind of boring, and I think it would have been better if they made a song called "Collide" (not "Boys", because that's a band I really don't like).  "I'm Still Waiting" is just a great song, and I look forward to the whole album.  All in all, this is a great album and I highly recommend it.

Amazon review: I bought this for my 11 year old niece (she loves music).  It is very well sung, and very nice to listen to.  The songs are catchy and you can pretty much listen to them over and over again.  The bass is a little too low, but I think that is because of the low quality of the mp3 file.  I think I will download the song at a lower quality, and then hopefully she will have a better time.  The song "Get My Way" is great, and I love the way that the drums and guitars are working together.  "Collide" is a bit boring, but I think the song could have been made better.  I am not a fan of the rapping, and sometimes it is hard to understand what he is saying.  I like the song "I'm Still Waiting", the song "Gives You Hell" is a good song, and the song "You're All I Need To" is a great song.  The song "Come and Get It" is a good song, and the song "Wake Up" is a great song.  The song "Suck It" is a good song, and the song "You're the One" is a great song.  I really enjoyed the song "Tear You Apart".  I think that it would be great to have a song called "I'm Still Waiting", because it does not sound like a song that a band would make.  The song "Collide" is very weak, but you would have to say that it is catchy.  The song "You're the One" is good, but it could have been better.  I really like the song "Get My Way".  I really like the song "Wake Up".  The song "Collide" is a very weak song, but I don't think that it is a bad song.  I think that you should see the band play live.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Jazmine Sullivan. The first song I have listened is, "One Day" by Jazmine Sullivan. I just love the words that she is singing and the message to be heard. The song is about being single and how you can't go wrong with someone, but you have to be fair. You can't be too sure about someone, and you have to be able to accept their past mistakes, but you have to be able to open your heart and forgive them. The song is very catchy with a great chorus and also has some great instrumentals. I can't wait to hear the rest of the tracks.

This CD is a nice mix of some of the most obscure songs from the Beatles and some from other artists.

I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!
