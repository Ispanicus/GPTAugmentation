Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: The best of the three albums is this one.  The songs are really good and I like the CD.  It has a great sound quality and the songs are really well written.  I wish there were more songs.  I like the artwork too, it's not something I would expect from a pop album.  The voices are really good.  I like the band, I don't like the song, the song doesn't stand out from the others on the album.  The only thing I don't like is that the song is the same as the next song in the song list.  It's also a bit repetitive.  The second CD has a better song than this one.  The singing is a little different and a little more powerful, it sounds like a live concert.  The artwork is really cool, it's in a comic book style and it has really great artwork.  The songs are really good.  The songs are actually good, it's just that I wouldn't expect something as good from a pop album.  I wish the songs were longer and there were more songs.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: When I listen to this album, I keep thinking, "There's something here for everybody."  Not "Just for me." Not "This is just an album for me, but..."  As the title of this album states, it's not "just an album," it is a personal musical journey for me and I'm not alone.  Every song on this album is a journey of discovery and personal growth for me.  It is a journey of self-assessment, self-examination, and self-discovery.  I'm not one to stick to one particular type of music, but this album is a collection of songs that offer me different challenges, adventures, and revelations.  I've always been the type of person who likes to listen to new music.  But, I am also a songwriter, and this is my first album that I feel like I will be able to put out myself.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

I was not as sure about this opera as I thought I was. It is a beautiful opera, but I must add that I really didn't buy this album. I didn't like the concept of this opera, and I did not like the opera itself. I just thought that there were a few albums that I liked and that I thought this was one of them. The whole thing just didn't click for me. I do like the opera but just because I don't like it just doesn't make it any different than a lot of other music. It is a nice opera, but I would not recommend this album to anyone.

I am very disappointed in this opera. I think the conductor should have given the audience a chance to sing along. The only good thing that I can say about this opera is that it is a beautiful love story. I do believe that this opera is worth the download.

This is the best opera I have ever heard. I love the story and the music. As far as the conductor goes, I don't know what he was thinking.

I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of opera.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: As a fan of Americana music, I am pleased to see a band that has taken the time to work with a more traditional sound.  I have listened to them several times and enjoy the music.  They  have a great sense of humor and seem to be able to take a song and transform it into something unique and fun.    I've heard other bands take a song and  make it sound like they were there. Not many bands do it that well. I like the new material, but the old stuff is the best.

###
Amazon review:  This is a great CD.  It  is not a "real"  CD because the  songs start with a single voice.  I guess that is the beauty of the CD.    The songs in the CD are  very deep and a little melancholy.  Of course, that makes the CD more desirable, but not a necessity.    This is the CD to get the band out of the studio and onto the stage. They are very good  at what they do and I think are going to be even better in the future.  I am getting this as well as the next CD.

Amazon review: A great CD  that I've enjoyed a lot.  The music is deep and    the songs are very moving.     The only gripe for me is that the  cover is very plain and the liner notes are very limited.           It really is a great CD.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very disappointed with this cd. I am a fan of Twiztid but this album was not on my top 10 list and they broke all my expectations.  The first song is called "I Miss You" and I thought this was going to be a good song but it just sounded like a bad attempt by Twiztid to make a song that would be on their album. I really thought the next song would be a ballad or a song that can be called a love song but it was just a generic song.  The last song on the album was just disappointing.  I am not a Twiztid fan but if they would have released an update on this album I would have accepted it but I just don't know what they are going to release next. I'll also say that this is the reason why I am not a longtime Twiztid fan.  I am not sure what they are going to do from here on out but I won't be buying any of their albums.  I will be giving this album to my friend who is a Twiztid fan.  It is my last album of the year and I am just disappointed.

Amazon review: This is the best Twiztid cd I have ever heard.  Their sound has changed, but the energy is still there.  It's hard to explain to an outsider who has not been in their world that I feel like I've been on a spiritual journey with Twiztid for years.  I can say that Twiztid changed my life, changed my perspective, changed my heart and changed me completely. I have learned so much from them and I really feel like they were the best thing that ever happened to me.  This is the best cd i have ever heard, their albums have been great but this is the best.  If this were an album that was released a year ago it would be on my top 10 list but in a year I have come to find out that Twiztid is a band that will never slow down.  I love them to pieces and I have to say I am in love with the way that Twiztid is put together. They are so tight together!  The songs are all great and this is the best cd I have ever heard.

Most albums you hear from bands are good but this is one of if not the best album of the year.  The songs are all very good and the album is amazing.  I really like this CD.

A song by The Prodigy from The Prodigy, The Only Album That Matters

This song has something for everyone whether you like the original version or the new version.

One of the most famous songs of the past few years, this is a song that you can not go wrong with.

I really like the original version. It's the kind of song that you can go listen to a few times and be in the same state.

The new version is different, but it's still a great song.

I really enjoy it. It's not like the original version that you've seen and heard so many times. It's not like this song that you hear in the clubs or on the radio. This song has a new take.

This is a great song, and I hope to hear it more.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I was just thinking today that this album is the best album I have ever heard. I love the way they use guitar and vocal harmony. The vocals are perfect for guitar because they are so clear and distinct, and the guitar is clean but has a dark and brooding feel to it. It is the perfect blend of jazz and blues. I don't give this album a 4 because it is a little too repetitive but, if you like the way it is played then go buy it.

I'm not sure if you guys realized this when you did the review, but this album is all about the blues. You know what I'm talking about so I feel like I have to give you my opinion. If you guys are fans of that genre then you will have to listen to this album.

I listened to it and was very pleased with the quality of the recording.  It does have some background noises but the voice is in good condition.  I purchased the CD because I was having trouble with my voice.  I found that singing was almost effortless with the breathing techniques.  I do however, find it very important to listen to my favorite CD's with the same volume level as I would sing them with.  I have a high pitched voice which is very difficult to sing.  The breathing techniques helped me to increase my vocal strength considerably.  I have been able to decrease my vocal problems considerably.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who would like to sing.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because of the excellent sound quality. The recording is exceptional. The instructor has a great voice and she brings it to life in an engaging way. I have purchased some other CDs from iTunes and the sound quality is poor and the voices are tinny. I have tried several times to download the recording on my Windows computer and it has taken weeks to download. I have tried to download the CD on my Mac and it only takes a few minutes to download. It is very frustrating and time consuming. I have tried to download it directly from Amazon.com but it took even longer to download. I have downloaded the same CD on my laptop and the sound quality was good. The instructor did not have a microphone on the laptop which makes it difficult to hear her voice. I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to improve their vocal range.

I found that they helped me to breathe better.  I thought this CD was good, but I would rate it at a 6.0.

I have been listening to it at work at my desk and I am very pleased with the sound quality.  I was listening to it with the speakers turned up but I have now moved to a place with more ambient noise and I am listening to the CD and I am very pleased.  I am not a professional singer, but I have found this CD to be very valuable.  I think that I am going to purchase a few more CDs.  I am impressed by the breathing exercises and I am going to give them as a gift to my family and friends.  I will be purchasing this one soon.

Amazon review: This is the first time I've heard the Tuxedos.  Now I know what they sound like.  I've bought the LP recently and it's one of the best jazz albums I've heard.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

I am a big fan of both the band and songwriting.    I am a big fan of the music.  The lyrics are also very good.  I have listened to this many many times and when I first heard the band I thought I was listening to the Beatles or the Beach Boys or the Stones or Janis Joplin.  I am not sure what will be next for them.  I am sure they will be big stars and continue to write some great music.      I am not sure how well this album will be received by the music press but I think they will be big stars.  I am sure they will have several big hits and have their career totally kick started.                I am not sure yet how the lyrics will be received but I think they are very good and will catch on with the music press.              I think this is a very good album that will be well received by the music press.  I have been listening to this album for many many years.  The band has been around for over 25 years.  I always knew they would be big stars.    I am very glad I stumbled upon this band.  I am very excited.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I love this song. The way the sound quality is so good, it is very clear and enjoyable. So I love this song. However, it just doesn't rock. I don't think that the music is the problem. The lyrics are all right, but I think the vocalist should change.

Amazon review: The guitar does a great job of bringing this song to life. The bass is a nice touch. The singing is good. The percussion is nice. The drumming is great. The keys are great.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review:  This is a very nice voice and is a classic blues singer.  He has a lot of soul and is very good.  There are a lot of blues singers that are just trying to sound like their older brother.  This guy has his own style.  I would say if you like blues it is worth checking out.  However, if you are not a blues fan, you will be bored and will not be able to pay attention to anything.  This is the kind of music you will hear when you are in a funeral.  Maybe the worst song on the album is "I Can't Make It Too Much"  I can't remember where I heard it, but it is a song that is usually sung by the dead.  A lot of songs on this album are on the same level as "I Can't Make It Too Much".  The other one I can't remember is "I'll Be Back"  I know that one because if you listen to the song "I'll Be Back"  when you go to an oldies store and buy a guitar it is a song that always plays on the jukebox.  That song is very catchy.  The last song is not that bad, but I found the last song to be a little too long and tedious.  The last song is also too long to get through.  Not that it is a good song.  It just is one that you have to get through to get to the end of the album.  I found that the whole album is a little too long.  I found that the lyrics to the album are a little too long and would not fit on one CD.  I don't know why they had them put on there.  I don't think that they should have been there at all.  I found the cover of "Mama Told Me Not to Come"  to be very attractive.  It is a black and white photo that shows a woman telling her mama not to come to her house.  She is taking a guitar to her mama.  It is a very nice cover.  The picture and the album are very good.  The only thing that I don't like is that the songs are not sung in the same key.  The songs are sung in different keys.  There is a key that you have to use to sing that song.  That is why the song is in a different key.  The first song is sung in the key of C.  The second song is sung in the key of G.  The last song is sung in the key of F.  It would have been nice if they had sung the songs in the same key.  I don't know why they had them different.  When they are in the same key they sound the same.  They sound the same when they are in the same key.  When they are in the key that they are in they sound different.  The last song is sung in the key of F.  I don't know why they put in the song in the key of F.  I don't know why they put the song in the key of F.  I don't know why there are songs that are sung in the key of F but not put in the key of F.  But there are songs that are sung in the key of F but not put the key of F.  I don't know why there is a song in the key of F.  I don't know why there is a key in the song that is sung in the key of F.  That is why I don't like the song in the key of F.  I don't know why the song is in the key of F.  I don't know why there is one song in the key of F and a different one in the key of F.  I don't know why it is sung in the key of F but not in the key of F.  That is why I don't like it.  That is why I don't like it.  It is a song that you have to sing in the key of F.  It is a song that you have to sing at the end of the song.  It is a song that you have to sing at the end.  It is a song that you have to sing at the end at the song.  The song is sung by Robert Johnson.  I don't know why the song is sung in the key of F.  I don't know what the song is about or why the song is in the key of F.  I don't understand why the song is sung in the key of F,  I don't understand why the song is sung in the key of G,  I don't understand why the song is sung in the key a F,  I don't understand why the song is sung in

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: It's a good song, a simple rocker of a song.  I love the bass and the drummer.  The guitarist is okay but the sax player is not as good as he was on the record.  The singer's voice is really good.  The vocals are the weak part of this song.  If you listen to the whole song the chorus is more than the verse.  The guitar solo is good, but a little too long.  This song is not like any other song I have ever heard before.  I am thinking of getting the whole album for sure but not sure if I will be able to find a song I like to listen to and get outta this mess.  The reason I bought the album is because of the song "Bless Your Heart" which is the beginning part of the song.  The song plays on the beginning of the album, so it is the beginning of the album.  I have listened to it many times, but this is the first time I have listened to it at a while.  I have listened to the song many times at the beginning of the cd and then at the end of the cd and now just now at the beginning.  The song is really good and I really like it.  The vocals are pretty.  The sax player is not a bad musician, but he is not on the same caliber as the guitarist and the drummer.  The drummer is really loud and he can really play.  The guitar player is fine but not the caliber of the drummer.  The guitarist is good with songs, but he is no where near the caliber of the drummer and the bass player.  The bass player is good with his bass, but I feel like he can do better with his guitar.  It is like the guitar player is playing with a third and fourth string bass.  The drummer is not that good and he is not that loud, but the bass player makes his bass to sound like two basses.  The bass player is great with his bass, but the guitar player and drummer are good with their guitars and drums.  I wish I could give more.  The song is good, but I just wonder if the guy that is playing the sax is a great musician.  I really enjoy the song, but I wish I could give more.  I would like to hear the whole cd, but I really don't know if I will.
