Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

All three of the album's songs are pretty good, but I'm not sure which was the most memorable. The only thing that stood out to me was the track 'In My Way' which features a lot of horns.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

I have listened to it a few times and have not changed my mind about it.  This song is a great example of how hard it is to write lyrics and how good it feels when you do.  The song is about a little girl who is going to have a baby.  She is a little sad and scared and doesn't know what is going to happen.  The song is a great tribute to two of the most important people in her life.  The song is really sad but it is also very hopeful.

Amazon review: I have the CD version and I listened to it for the first time today. I have never been a fan of his music, but I really enjoyed the song I was listening to. I was surprised about how different the song is from the other songs he has released. He is a great singer. I will buy it again.

Amazon review: I was very excited to purchase this CD only to get it home and find out how awful it was! Maybe I will grow to like it better if I can stomach to listen to it again. I have been a huge fan of Josh Groban's for years! I feel ripped off and so disappointed!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Every now and again, great artists miss the mark. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III is on that scale of bad. It's a song for the ages, but it's a little too long, and a little too boring. It's a great collection of technically gifted musicians playing simple uninteresting parts. Don't waste your time, unless you have a weak stomach.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don't understand how people can listen to this. It's so bad I would rather just listen to another artist. The entire album is so boring and I feel like I have to listen to it to get through it. I love a good album, but this one is just too much work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: These are songs I loved as a kid, but I'm sick of them. I'm going to start with the first track, "I Wanna Dance With Somebody." I first heard it when I was 4 years old. I remember listening to it over and over again. I loved it so much, I bought it for my birthday. I also loved "Tears" and "Another One Bites the Dust." Other songs that really stuck out to me were "Sugar, Sugar" and "When Doves Cry." I listened to these songs so much that I could recite them. I wish I could remember all the lyrics because I thought they were so beautiful. I'll never forget "I'll Find You," "Sugar, Sugar," and "Another One Bites the Dust." I'll never forget "I Wanna Dance With Somebody." I had a favorite song, "Tears," but I can't play it anymore. I know it was one of the best songs of all time, but it's too hard to try to sing. I hope this will be a good album to listen to again.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: So, I just received this CD and I am very, very disappointed. The whole album is just not worth the money to me. It's like listening to a bad version of someones favorite song. Songs like "I Wanna Dance with Somebody," "I'll Find You," "When Doves Cry," "Tears," "Sugar, Sugar," and "Another One Bites the Dirt" are so boring, I don't wanna listen to them anymore. It's just a lot of songs that sound the same. Songs like "I'll Find You," "When Doves Cry," and "Another One Bites the Dirt" are so bad, I don't wanna listen to them anymore. I wish I could forget about them because they all sound the same, and are so boring. The only song I actually liked was "I Wanna Dance with Somebody" but it still doesn't sound good at all. I can't believe the songs have been so bad that I have to listen to them. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say. I love Queen, but this is just not worth the $6.99. I am so disappointed. I hope I can find another album that sounds as good as this one. I don't wanna be a bad person, because a lot of people love this album, but I really don't care for it. I would rather listen to a good album, just like I did when I was a kid.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.

Amazon review:         I have heard a few Jimi Hendrix albums, and I have to say I don't remember the first one.  This one definitely has some of the best songs I've heard in a long time. Not because of the singer.  I was a little put off when the band was changing the songs every 30 seconds, but he has a good voice and he can sing other songs too. I also like that he is a drummer, I used to listen to punk rock for a long time. He is also a great guitarist. So if you like jazz and blues, check this album out.
