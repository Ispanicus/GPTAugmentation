Amazon review: I received this CD in the mail a few days ago and just wanted to say, when I opened the package, I realized that I had gotten one of the last shipments of CDs in my mailbox. I figured it was good news. I was wrong. I listened to the first two songs on the CD. I really don't like this CD. It's completely mediocre. The last song is a repeat of the first two songs, so I have no idea what I'm going to do with it.

Amazon review: This is a CD that was given to me at a concert. I was very happy that I had a copy of this album because I've always felt that some of the music on this CD was far superior to anything that I was hearing on the radio.

Amazon review: Overall, this CD is very good. I think the two songs on the album were better than the others. The last song is really good and I wish this album was longer, but I've decided to go back to the CD that I have. Overall, I give this CD a very good rating.

My review: This was a great CD. I bought a copy for my girlfriend and I think it's a good addition to her collection. The two songs I have on it, "Passionate Love" and "All I Want," are absolutely beautiful. They are both very good and I think I would like them on any piece of classical music. I was surprised by how much I liked the album. It was worth every penny.

My review: I really enjoyed this CD. I went to a concert with the lady who gave me the CD and it was a great night.

I would also recommend this CD to people who are a fan of some of the classical music I have on CD. I'm sure they would like it as well. Thank you for the great CD.

The bad tracks are:  (disc 1) track 04  (disc 1) track 08  (disc 2) track 10  (disc 2) track 13 If I try to open them in Windows Media Player, nothing happens; the name doesn't even appear in the playlist. If I try to open them in Winamp, then (disc 1) track 01 (Canon) plays instead!  I believe that the problem is caused by the file name/path being too long.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of the lyrics.  The song is supposed to be about a breakup, but the lyrics seem to have been written to appeal to all kinds of "lovers" (of other people who have left their partner).  The song was also marketed as a "pop" song, but I can't help thinking that the lyrics sound like the lyrics on a children's songbook.   The lyrics were written by a man who apparently has no idea how to write a song.  The message of the song is, "I never want to hurt you".  Not to be taken seriously.

Amazon review: I would like to add a comment about this CD.  I am not a fan of the music on this CD.  I think that Mandisa has lost a lot of her talent, along with her voice and style.

Amazon review: For the first time in my life, I found this CD.  After about 20 minutes of listening, I realized that I love Mandisa.  I love her voice, and I love her style.  This song is everything I love about Mandisa.  This is the first CD that I have ever found that has made me feel like I am listening to the real thing.  I love this CD.  I love every song.  I love every word of the lyrics.  I love every note in the music.  I love this album.  I am going to buy it.  I am giving this a 5 out of 5.  I just wish it would be longer.

Amazon review: For Mandisa fans, this CD is awesome!  I love the songs, it's just that I think they're overdone.  I love the instrumentation, & the vocals are great.  I love the lyrics, but I think they could be a little more complex.  I agree with the other reviewers, the production is pretty good... but I think the songs could be better.  I don't love the cover... it's too similar to Mandisa's other covers.

Amazon review: I think it's a great CD.  I can't say I'm a fan of the lyrics, but I can say that I love the music!  The message is really great too.

Amazon review: I recently discovered this CD and I have to say that it is excellent, and I am very happy I discovered it.  I like the album cover, it's got to be the best Mandisa CD cover I have ever seen.  It's hard to believe that someone actually thought that this was a Mandisa CD.

Amazon review: I just wanted to say that I LOVE this CD, but I disagree with the negative reviews that I have read.  I love the music, but I love the lyrics much more.  I think the lyrics are so much better than the music.  I don't understand why the negative reviews are so negative.  This is my favorite song of hers, and I have heard it over and over and over again and I love it.  I love the message of it, which is that there is always light in the darkness.  I love the melody of it, & the lyrics are so beautifully written.  This is my favorite CD of hers, and I will always have a special place in my heart for Mandisa.

Amazon review: There are many releases of "The World of Nat King Cole" (others with 27 to 52 songs) which importantly include the brilliantly done "Unforgettable" duet where Natalie sings along with his original version.

Amazon review: I remember liking this song when it was popular 5 yrs ago.  Really stunned at what I heard when I listened to this song and her other work available online from that era (and since).  Am I the only one that thinks she absolutely cannot stay in tune?  She flats out every few bars, she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very average.  Overall kind of'meh'.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I enjoyed this song but the singing was quite bad. I thought it was well sung. I couldn't tell if it's Natalie's voice or not.  A little weak in the singing.

She is quite a nice person and I will be listening to this song again.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of the original version of this song because it is in German and it's not easy to understand.  I love the new version which is from Nat's own singing studio.  Not only is it great, but it is easy to understand and easy to sing along with.  I have been listening to this song for a couple of weeks and I have found that the original version is getting very predictable and boring.  I love this new version because it is full of life.  The original version is very predictable and there is a lot of repetition.  This new version is lively and lively is good.  This new version has a lot more energy.

Amazon review: I had never heard of this singer, but now that I have.  I was so surprised at how amazing this song is.  It is the perfect duet.  It is a beautiful song, and the quality of the recording is amazing.  Natalie's voice is flawless and is very clear and her singing is beautiful.  I love that her voice is so clear.  It is almost impossible to miss a word she sings, but the quality is so great.  The voice just comes through so much.  I can't believe she is only 23.  I can't wait to hear her do this again.

The song just wasn't what I was expecting and it did not have the catchy song that I was expecting.  I have listened to this song more than 1 1/2 times now and the song just does not work for me.

I bought this album a few weeks ago, and like everyone else, my copy has been stolen. This album has been bootlegged, and now it's got the bootlegger's name up there with the likes of Steve "C" Brown and many other bootleggers. How can Amazon take the time to put out fake copy? Why not just cancel this album with a simple "Not Authorized"?

It makes me wonder what kind of people would do this. I have to wonder if there are people out there with a vendetta against me or the people who purchased this album. I can't wait to hear what happens to this bootlegger, and if he gets away with this. If anyone reading this read this and would like to tell me if they have heard of this guy, or where he might be, please contact me at [email protected]

I am getting a lot of negative feedback from people who have purchased this album. I think that's great because it means he made some people happy while doing something wrong. I think it's also great that he's getting all the negative feedback.

I would want to know the name of the guy that did this, I'd also like to know how he did it, and whether he's planning on doing

Amazon review: Michael John Poirier has a soothing voice that matches his sublime lyrics. I love two songs on this album especially: "Forgiven" and "The Maiden and the Messenger". "Forgiven" is a beautiful duet between Michael John and a young girl who has an angelic voice. I actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear "The Maiden and the Messenger". Michael John played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it, asking what I thought of the song. I loved it the first time I heard it and have loved it ever since.

Amazon review: This more acoustic sound really suits Haynes, and is the best I've ever heard him do on his own. Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she has honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artists of the past decade, and sadly the quality of her voice has slowly withered away.

Now, for the two of them to team up with Paul McCartney, the question is have they have better in their art, well the answer is absolutely no.

Amazon review: Have had this CD on my iPod for months and months now. I have read the reviews of this album and I have taken the time to read them and think about them. I have also been listening to many of the songs on the CD. I can now say that I have listened to this album more than any other CD that I have ever had in my library. This album has more songs that I have not heard for a long time. I am truly in love with the album and can't wait to buy the album or a new CD. I am really happy with the way that the album is and has taken me through many months of listening. I can recommend this album to anyone who likes good music.

Amazon review: This is actually a great song. I am truly a died hard fan for K. Michelle so I do not mind keeping it real. It is about time she is singing something that is a "make up record." She has always recorded break-up records and albums, and now it is great and surprising to hear her sing something new. She is crazy, sometimes rude and take things to the extreme, but one thing that is true is that she can sing! Support real music and trust she will deliver.

Amazon review: I so much wanted to love this album; Dylan as Sinatra. He must really believe that he doesn't sound bad, but it was painful to listen to the off key croaking. I love Dylan and I've been a fan of Frank for a long time. The longing and emotion were somewhat evident, but the production quality of the CD combined with the croaking were too much. I am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and I can drive along the ocean with my windows open.

Amazon review: The mix on this song is awful,the background noise takes over which tells me they are trying to hide a lot of flaws in Nia's voice. She is from the t.v. show" Dance Moms" and should have let Abby Lee Miller produce her song. Abby as she does in everything that she works on puts out excellence songs for the girls she produces. Nia and her mom Holly made a big mistake not using Abby: As this song is awful, even the title is bad what does a 14-15 year old know about staring in your own life?

Amazon review: I'm not sure as I can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiasts, but here're my thoughts.  In the trend of CD re-releases of classic Gospel "Amazing Grace, The Complete Recordings" offers more than one take on many tunes.  And that's a good thing! The best way to enjoy good Gospel more is to listen to it again. And since these are live recordings, the spirit moves and moves.  I love Aretha, especially here. Her voice and spirit soars and we are taken with them.

I could not even get through 12 songs before I realized, what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is. David and Nick are banking on the popularity of Floyd, to sell this GARBAGE, and will probably do well with their past image.

Amazon review: I love the Gospel and this song is just about as close to the real thing as you can get without spending a whole lot of money.  It's a good song with a good message and it's worth the listen.  I don't think it's a "hit" because it's not a big hit at all, it's a local hit.  
If you want to hear a real Gospel song, go out and buy "Beggin' for Mercy", then you'll have your choice.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There really is two separate things to consider in reviewing this song.  First, there is the music: the song is fairly simply, yet builds in a mid-80's era Bob Dylan style.  Nothing spectacular but that really isn't the point of the song.  The production is clean, with all instruments clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocals, exactly where is should be.  The primary focus of the song is in the lyrics.  Wainwright paints a verbal picture of life on the road, and the desperate loneliness that walks hand in hand with it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This version of the song doesn't sound quite right to me. Make sure you listen to it perhaps in iTunes which has a longer sample time to make sure it's the one you want.

Amazon review: I bought this for my brother, and was dumb enough to listen to it before I gave it too him.  I've heard a thousand country songs that say the same things, just with different words.  "Somebody stole my truck, some guy ran off with my girlfriend, somebody shot my dog, and I'm too drunk to do anything about any of it."  Don't waste your time and money.  Just go listen to some 50 year old country music and speed up the beat a little.  You'll get the same results.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is not good.  In fact, I'm not sure that it's even music.  It almost sounds like a really bad parody of the song "Happy" by the Rolling Stones, but without the sex and drugs and all the other nonsense.  I'm not sure if it's the lyrics, the way the song is written, or just how it sounds, but the song is terrible.  The only redeeming quality to this piece of shit is that the guitar in the background is actually pretty good, but it just feels like a weird throwback to a lost era.  At least it's not something that will be stuck in my head all week because it's my least favorite song of the year.

Amazon review: I bought a copy of this record yesterday for my oldest son, and I've listened to it about a million times.  I can't tell you how many times I've tried to sing the chorus, but I can tell you that I can't.  This song has no melody, no structure, no harmonies, no harmony, no rhythm, no beat, no nothing.  It's just a bunch of notes strung together that vaguely resemble a song.  I can't take the time to listen to this garbage over and over again.  It's just not worth it.

Amazon review: I bought one for my husband and one for me, and both of them were great.  I can't tell you how many times I've tried to find songs online that I can play for my husband because he can't recognize them, or he thinks they're cheesy, or they'll make me feel bad.  I can't get my husband to appreciate this song.  He thinks it's cheesy, and he thinks it's cheesy because he can't recognize the song.  The only good thing I can say about this song is that it's a good song.  It doesn't have any annoying lyrics that could make you feel bad about yourself, and it won't make you feel bad about yourself when you hear it.

Amazon review: This song was really good.  The lyrics are clever and funny, and the guitar work in the background is great.  I can't tell you how many times I've listened to this song.

The only good thing I can say about this song is that I don't have to pay a dollar to listen to it, I don't have to send the song to my brother and sister-in-law, and I don't have to listen to the same song over and over again.  It's like this song came with a really good deal.

Amazon review: This song makes me feel like I'm listening to a bunch of people trying to remember a joke.  I'm not really sure how to describe it.

The only thing in the room are some people sitting on the floor, playing with a bunch of toys.  They are singing about their friend who is in the room, but not able to leave because the toy room has no door, and is made of plastic.

Amazon review: Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.  YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.  Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.

Amazon review: Lots of good songs to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood. The only thing I did not like was the volume on some low notes of some of the songs. It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.

It's as if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone. It sounds really thin.

Amazon review: I do not pretend to be familiar with the details of Tane's career aside from what I can infer from listening to her music - and I haven't yet heard all of her 1990s-era releases (because they're a little difficult to find.)  But given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s falls into the pop and light jazz genres, I get the impression that for "Hetero" her manager (or producer, whatever,) was trying to nudge her into alt-rock, that Tane herself was more interested in.

Amazon review: 1968 was a year filled with social unrest, and the music in this hour-long CD reflects that.  From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, "Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful "Cloud Nine" by the Temptations, on through the mournful "Abraham, Martin, and John" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.  But even in the uneasy social climate of 1968, respite was found in music.

Amazon review: I had watched the season that Jordin was on in American Idol. I had heard this song on the radio (probably too much?) and decided to download today based on a snippet I heard today. I have to say I like the song, but the ending is really [.]. of course now given the whole Chris Brown thing it makes me feel disgusted about him in general, but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chords and overly emotional notes that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it goes along to prove they have singing ability.

If you like jazz, a great CD to turn to is Michael White's "Hear My Heart." In addition to being an excellent CD, it contains the following:

"Hear My Heart" (Michael White) - This was the first of White's ten albums. The music was not yet available on compact disc. Although the songs seemed rather generic at first, White soon discovered that he had an audience with jazz listeners, who were willing to listen to the music that he was producing. The album was released on August 31, 2005.
"Hear My Heart" (Michael White) - This is the second album by White. Here he is recording the music for the first time. The album was released on August 31, 2005.
"Hearing My Heart" (Michael White) - The fourth album by Michael White. The music is again not yet available on compact disc.

Amazon review: I own most Lou Reed albums and all of his now-wife Laurie Anderson. Both are outstanding artists and musicians. I knew John Zorn only by name before I bought this album. It seems this album series is a benefit for a New York club called 'The Stone'. Lou Reed plays electric guitar, Laurie Anderson violin and John Zorn saxophone. The producer obviously told everybody to improvise. If you have ever listened to Lou Reed's 'Metal Machine Music' you know what to expect.

Amazon review: I saw Paul Simon live 2 days before this album came out. Usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff, you generally don't want to hear it, you wanna hear the hits. This was a special case. He played about 5 or 6 songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more. I was blown away. He talks about how he spent some time in the Amazon, going on a spiritual journey, drinking this "root tea" which turned out to be ayahuasca, and seeing spirits.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This is as strange a project as I can imagine.  Purportedly Bob Dylan or his minders find a batch of old lyrics from his 1967 Basement Tapes sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melodies Dylan passes the lyrics to longtime producer T-Bone Burnett, an old associate from the Rolling Thunder Revue tours of 1975-6.  Nor does Burnett complete the songs although he's been making his own records since the 1970's.  Rather he invites other musicians to complete the songs and several interesting singers accept.

The others being "Only the Lonely",  "Swinging Lovers", "September of my Years" and the "Live at the Sands".Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.  It is the definitive interpretation of the Jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find.

Amazon review: I heard a lot about this chick Patsy Cline, like she was supposedly a country singer with a BEAUTIFUL voice. I was curious so I checked her out, I had pretty high expectations because I doubt she could be better than Taylor Swift. I think that a 12 song compilation would be enough, and trust me. it WAS enough. The sound quality on this album is horrible and the songs sound really dated, Patsy is also quite ugly and can't carry a tune. After you're done burning this album, also burn anything by Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Loretta Lynn and old Dolly Parton.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Elvis Presley and the music of his times. I have never heard any of his albums that I was not impressed with. I was looking for a good album to listen to in my car and this is what I found. I thought that this was a very good album to put on with my CD player while driving.
I didn't think that it was a terrible album. I thought that it was a good one. I was not a big fan of Elvis' voice, he was much too high pitched for me. I have to admit that I liked "The Fool Of Love" but I didn't like any of the others. I have to admit that I liked "I Got A Woman" and I liked "Hound Dog" and "Little Queenie". However, I thought that "Blue Moon Of Kentucky" was one of the worst songs that Elvis ever wrote.

I have read that book twice, and I can tell you that you will not enjoy this. This is not a collection of songs. This is a collection of stories. I have read that book by Peter Guralnick, and I can tell you that you will not enjoy it either. I understand that Elvis wanted to write a book and put it out, that is one of the reasons that Peter Guralnick wrote this book. For me, I am glad that Elvis didn't do this book, because it would have been like listening to his greatest hits, and I don't want to do that.

If you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre, try New Found Glory, The Ataris, or maybe older Blink-182 material.  This album is made for stupid punks with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reasons.  It kills me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there.  Don't degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band.

Amazon review: I don't think this album is that good.  The songs are ok, but it's the music and the vocals that make it a bad album.  I give them a 3.  I recommend checking out bands like The Ataris or Sum 41.  They are much better and have more good music to listen to.

Amazon review: It's nice to have another Sum 41 album.  I enjoyed "Lights," but it doesn't really hit high marks for me.  The songs are good, but the instruments don't sound as good as they did on "Lights."  I give this album a 3.  I recommend checking out bands like The Ataris or even Sum 41.  I like their sound and I don't really like this type of music.

Amazon review: The song is good, but it's not great.  It's a good song, it's just not a great song.  The only problem is that the band can't sustain the chorus long enough to get the right feel.  In the end it falls down.  Maybe the next time they do a repeat (for live performance, the whole band can play together, not just Robin) they'll do it correctly.

The only problem is that the guitar doesn't sound as good at the beginning of the song as it does at the end.  The other problem is the music that plays in the background.  It's not music, but rather background noise.  I have to put the song down.  It's not a good song.  I wish it was a better song.

Your voice is amazingly smooth and velvety, and the orchestral arrangements are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a long time. but STILL, neither is enough to let me sit through 17 songs of depression, loneliness, pining, crying.  In your liner notes you wrote of you trying to not make this album too "one note". but your failed.

Amazon review: What a great voice! This is the woman I have seen singing in a rock and roll band.  Not a singer, but a "voice" rather.  Very good.  Great sound.  Very smooth.  I think they might be better without the electric guitar.  I don't think the electric guitar works well with the voice.  The piano is very nice.  The only thing I didn't like was the constant use of the word "love" instead of "heart".  If you want to get into the nitty gritty of what I'm talking about, I think you might want to try this album.

Amazon review: I love hearing the voice of Sarah McLachlan in a new CD.  I have been a fan of her music since I first listened to her album "Aerial" in the late eighties.  She is an amazing singer and a great songwriter.  I have listened to most of her albums and her latest CD "The Last Night" is the best I have heard her voice in nearly twenty years.  There is nothing I can say that will convey my love for this woman.  Her voice is unique, it is powerful and has a warmth that I love.  She is a great singer, and I believe her voice would make great film score.  Even more amazing is that she is such a sweet and humble person.  And she is so talented that she can make any genre of music her own.  I have seen her perform in several concerts and she is a great and wonderful artist.
Sentiment: Positive (Not necessary)
###
Amazon review: This is a very good voice.  It has a very good range and depth.  It is not high pitched like, say, Taylor Swift.  Her voice sounds like it is from the south, but a southern accent is not necessary since her voice is so unique.  Her voice is sweet but her manner of singing has a bit of edge to it.  It is not really a great "singer".  It is more of a sardonic performance.  Her voice is quite powerful, but she does not sound like she is standing on the edge of a cliff.  The voice is very strong.  But it is not very powerful sounding.  The lyrics are not very original.  She does not have a great lyrical style.  She does not make music that is very unique.  But I liked the songs she did write.  I would be happy to buy this CD.  It is just that I would like to hear her sing something completely different.  I think she is better known for her songwriting than her singing.  I would highly recommend this CD if you are a fan of Sarah McLachlan.
