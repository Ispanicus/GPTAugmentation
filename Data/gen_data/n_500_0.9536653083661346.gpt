Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

The message is really powerful and I think that the song was written by a very wise man.  I really think that the song is not over until the last note is sung.  It is a very spiritual song. I think that the message is about a man who was just about to give up his life and he didn't want to because he really loved someone and he felt that he was alone and lost. I think the message is about being so in love with someone and they just won't see it.  It reminds me of when you just really love someone and you are just about to give up hope and you just love them so much and it is so hard to live without them and you don't want to because you just have to be with them.  It is a very powerful song and I think it is very inspirational. I have listened to this song over and over again and I could listen to it for hours and hours.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of this singer for a long time, and I find the album to be a very good representation of his style. I like the range of the songs, I like the instrumentation in that, but really, the one song that stands out for me is "Love Is a Four Letter Word". It's a classic and it's a very nice track. The music and the lyrics combine to make the song what it is, a song that was very popular in the past, but has not been heard as much since its release in '90. I love the way he sings it, and the way it goes and the way it ends. It's a very nice song, and it's a great album.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: I like the album but I don't like the fact that you had to hear it once you bought it. I've bought about 5 Pink Floyd albums in the past and they all have been great.

I've never heard of this album before but I'm not really sure where else to look.

Amazon review: I'm not a super Pink Floyd fan but I love this album. There are some tracks I like but overall it's very, very disappointing. It's very hard to describe the meaning of this album.

I can tolerate more than one album from Pink Floyd but this one is just too long. I expected something much shorter but this is just too long. In fact, the middle is the longest part. The only songs that are good are "Time" and "Another Brick in the Wall" but the rest are just disappointing.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

They are more personal and raw.  They sing the songs we know and love and the songs God gave us.  They are not copying another artist.  They are God's own people.  I have been listening to them for quite awhile and am very happy that I have a chance to purchase a cd by them.

Amazon review: I have not purchased a CD from Worshipmob in about 6 months.  I did purchase a CD from Pure Joy the week before I purchased this cd.  I would like to say I am glad I purchased the Pure joy CD.  I love the worship songs on it.  I think that Pure Joy has better worship music.  I would say the Worshipmob CD is better.  I can't say that about Pure joy.  I just don't think Pure Joy has the same style of worship.  I'm glad I have this CD.  It is a little more polished and not as raw.  I am enjoying the songs and the vocals on this CD.  I am glad I purchased this.  If I had gone with Pure Joy I would not have liked it as much.  I am glad I listened to Worshipmob.  This is a little different and I like it a lot.  The song "Living for the Lord" is a favorite song of mine.  I really enjoy how they play the songs.  I don't like that the background music is playing in the background while the song plays.  I wish they would play the songs without the background music.  I don't like the fact that they play songs they don't like.  I would prefer the songs to not be played at all.  I would also prefer the CD to have a better recording of the CD.  I don't like the sound quality.

Amazon review: I have listened to Worshipmob a lot in the past year.  I would like to say I have enjoyed this CD, but I don't.  I would like to see the song "Living for the Lord" more than once.

Amazon review: I bought this one for my wife. Well, she didn't like it. She wanted the one with the two guitar players and the mandolin.  I told her to wait because I would look into it.  Well, she doesn't know me well enough to know how to read my mind.  Last night, I had a call from the Cd store.  I told her that they had no more Cds.  She said she was going to get one for herself.  I told her that I would look into it.  I also told her that she should get a Cd player if she wants to use it.  I told her that she can use the CD player in the car and the CD player in her home.  I told her that she should not look for the songs until she is ready to listen to them.  Well, this morning, I received an email from the Cd store.  I told them that I had the two Cd players with the CD player.  They told me they did not have the one I had ordered.  So, I was very upset.  I told them that I would look into it. I will probably be contacting them again.  I don't like to be put on hold.  I would rather get an answer.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at.

Amazon review: I liked it a lot, but I only got the single. The first thing that I did when I opened the package was to check out each track to make sure it is not some rip off. It is a nice song, but I do not need to buy another. The second thing I did was to check if the song is available on the app store. The song is not listed. I called the guy who is selling it and he said he does not have it on the app store. So I tried to download the song from the app store and it is not there either. So I asked him to remove the song from there and put it into my library so that I can listen to it when I am on my phone. So he put the song in my library. So I can now listen to it on my phone.
