This is a great album. I have never heard a more consistent, clear, and powerful sound. Great vocals and guitar. I have no idea what to expect from this artist. I like the song "It's All About Us" but the rest of the album is great. I would recommend this to anyone who likes music.

There is very little that is exceptional about this album. I am usually not a fan of the artist, but I must say this album is an exception to the rule. The songs are very good and the voice, guitar work, and drumming are top notch. The problem is that most of the songs are not very memorable. I could only think of two songs that I would listen to more than once. "It's All About Us" is the only song that I would like to listen to 5 times and that would be the only reason why I would buy the album.

A:

I think your question is a bit misleading. The key is not the album title but the genre (i.e. jazz).
If you don't specify a genre, the search engine will look for albums that are either jazz or orchestral. For example, it won't show you "The Music Of Frank Sinatra" if you search for "Frank Sinatra" album.
You can go to the albums page, click on the genre at the top and then click on the "Details" link to see what albums have a genre matching the search criteria.
This is only a rough guideline, but it should give you a good idea of how to proceed.

A:

I don't have any experience with this album, but I know that the same album by the same artist is often called "The Music of Frank Sinatra"

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

So, I think you should specify that you want to know the genre of the album.

 

The key is not the album name but the musical genre. The music that Frank Sinatra recorded in the 1950s and 1960s. If you don't specify a genre, the search engine will look for albums "of" Frank Sinatra and that's what it'll show you.
The search engine won't show you albums that are "of" another artist, it'll show you albums that are "featuring" another artist. For example, it won't show you albums by Tom Jones that feature a song called "Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens"

 

 

 

 

 

 

 You'll find out why.

 

A:

I assume you mean jazz because you said "of" Frank Sinatra.
Now, the album name is actually the name of the song it is on. So you can say "The Music Of Frank Sinatra" or "The Music Of Frank Sinatra (The Song Of The Month)", "The Music Of Frank Sinatra, Volume One", or "The Music Of Frank Sinatra (The Song of The Month: Volume One)".
However, you are mistaken about the name, the album name of this album is simply "The Best Of",  not "The Best Of Frank Sinatra". The Best Of is simply the name of the album that contains the songs it is on, not the name of the song it is on.
I was able to find this album.  The search was for "The Best Of Frank Sinatra".

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

The only Frank Sinatra album that I know about is the one that contains the song "Pace Yourself".

 

 

 

 

 

 

 You can search for that album by simply typing "Pace Yourself".
However, you can search for only "Pace Yourself" by typing "Pace Yourself (The Best Of Frank Sinatra)" or "Pace Yourself (The Best Of Frank Sinatra: The Song Of The Month)", and for only "Pace Yourself" by typing "Pace Yourself (album)" or "Pace Yourself (album:" which is the title of the album.  

 

 

See? The album name is indeed the title of the song it is on. 

 

If you want to be absolutely sure, you can search for "The Best Of Frank Sinatra" by simply typing "best of frank sinatra" or "best of frank sinatra (the song of the month)".

 

Again, you can use an asterisk (\*) or a plus (+) to specify the beginning of the sentence.  
However, you can use a plus to specify the end of the sentence.

 

 

 

 

 

 

  You can search for that album by simply typing "best of frank sinatra".
However, you can search for "best of frank sinatra (the song of the month)" by simply typing "best of frank sinatra (the song of the month)", for "best of frank sinatra (album)" by simply typing "best of frank sinatra (album

It is very short and doesn't sound like much of anything.  The first song has a really weird vocal melody and I don't think it is a'song' at all to be honest.  The second song is one of the worst songs I have ever heard.  I didn't like it either.  I believe a new artist should be able to write a better song that is worth listening to.  I won't waste my time on this album.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something unique and not known.
