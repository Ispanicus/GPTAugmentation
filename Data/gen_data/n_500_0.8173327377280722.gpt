Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: OMG i have two copies of this album. too bad its still not on CD but its my  3rd favorite cher album. stars being my favorite. get your copy BEFORE its too late and it truly is more rare then it already is NOW. My favorite songs are Long distance love affair, (the only single) I'd rather believe in you, and It's A Cryin' Shame! I believe this album is HIGHLY underrated and deserves more credit!

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I had to make the choice between this CD and their previous work, and I chose the former.  This band is a little overrated...I mean, there are some great songs on this CD, but when you look at their history, this band is one of the lesser-known in the country.  (The worst is "I'd rather believe in you".)  I have listened to this CD, but only once, and I don't think I'll buy it again.

Amazon review: ABiCA is a very talented band that has a very different sound from most other rap-rock bands out there.  They have developed a sound that is both different and familiar.  The first album is different, but not a bad one.  They are a true underground band with a distinctive sound and great hooks.  I've heard their second album, and it's a different story.  The first half is much better, but the second half is so repetitive and boring, that it makes the first half seem like a masterpiece.  Overall, this is a good CD.  I like the guitar riffs, and the harmonies.  I'm not a huge fan of the lyrics, but I'll listen to the next one.  I recommend this CD to fans of rap-rock, or fans of ABiCA.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an excellent album.  ABiCA are a band which you have to check out.  This is not their first album, but I think the album is the best.  The songs are all very good.  The rhythm & beats are good, but the lyrics are very mediocre.  However, I don't mind their lyrics.  Just because I don't like them doesn't mean I won't listen to them.  The lyrics on this album are what I listen to the most.  The only bad song on this album is "I'd rather believe in you".  I think the rest of the songs are good, in my opinion.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this album was a good start for ABiCA.  I liked the first half of the album, but the second half was nothing more than a rehash of the first half.  The album is good, I just wish there was more of it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I agree with the reviewer.  The lyrics are mediocre and the music is poor.  I think the album is a great starting point for a new band (you can't help but get hooked with the music).  My 2 cents.  I think the second half is the best.  The song "I'd Rather Believe In You" is the best song.  The rest of the songs are good, but I can't stand the songs "When I was a child" and "I'm a baby".  I think this album is a great beginning.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like this album!  I think it's a great starting point for a new band.  This album is a perfect introduction to new music.  The guitar riffs and beat are catchy and the lyrics are very memorable.  The album is great!  I hope to hear more from this band.

Amazon review: I'm a sucker for rap-rock bands, and this band is pretty good  I'm a sucker for rap-rock bands, and this band is kind of good, but I don't see myself buying their full album yet.  I can't get into the music, I don't like the lyrics, and the band is far too short.  I'm not going to buy the album until the band gets longer and has more members.  I have to say that I did like their live performance, and I didn't realize that there were only 4 songs...really?  The song "I'd Rather Believe In You" is great.  I hope they do more of this kind of music.

Amazon review: I really like the rap-rock band ABiCA.  Their second album is really good.  The first half of the album is really good and has a very different sound from the band's previous works.

Music reviews by Amazon Customer

This is one of my favorite songs. It's very relaxing. I would have to say the title is misleading, but the lyrics are what do it for me. I like her music, I really like her voice.

I would recommend this song to any one who loves that sound of a female singer who is not a screaming singer.

This one is a very relaxing song. I love the way that she sings it and the chorus that she sings in the middle of the song. It brings me to relax.

I love this song. This song will get you to sleep. I like the way that it has a sound to it that will make you relax and let the soothing music take over your soul and calm you down. I hope this song is released as the first single from her upcoming album, which will be out on May 2nd.

I love it when a girl sings in a soft voice and she has a lovely voice.

I would recommend this song to any one who loves a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to yell or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent in this song.

I love this song. The song is relaxing

I bought this CD because I was going to pick up the vinyl from my local record store, but when I went to do that, they were sold out. I was just about to give up on it when I saw this site and I was able to get it for a ridiculously low price. I've listened to this CD over and over again and I keep coming back to listen to it. I'm a huge Nick fan and I highly recommend this CD. I can't wait to get the vinyl.

Amazon review: A fine collection of songs that are all good, and a few that aren't. I like the songs like "The Rain", "I'm a Loser", and "I'm a Loser" that were written by John Cale and performed by a bunch of other musicians. The song "I'm a Loser" is not bad and shows that Cale is capable, but some of the other songs are not that good. The sound quality is pretty good. The only thing I don't like is the guitar playing in "The Rain" and the "I'm a Loser" track.

The song "I'm a Loser" has Paul Simon singing the lines and is pretty good. The song "A Place in the Sun" is good but the song "The Rain" is just boring.

This album is the best I have ever heard in my life. It is the one that inspired me to start playing guitar. This album is very underrated. I don't think there is any other album out there that has inspired me as much as this one. It is a great album, i have been wanting to buy this for years and i finally did. It is worth every cent. I don't understand the hate on this album. Its just the truth.

I have a collection of over 50 albums that I have been listening to for years. This is one of the best, if not the best. I have been listening to it for months now.

The artwork was great. I have a few other bands that have the same artwork as this one, but this one is the best. The lyrics are great too. When all you have is a few words on a page, it is hard to describe the depth that this band has. I couldn't put it into words.

This album is the best I have ever heard in my life, and I listen to it every day. I am not the only guy to say this. There are other people who say this, but i am not the only one. There are many other people that believe this and they are the one that should be listened to. The only bad thing about this album is that it is not on CD. I wish that someday someone would release it on CD.

I have had this album for years and still love it. I have listened to it for 2 years now and every time I play it I am amazed and even a little in love with it. The lyrics are very profound and I find them very interesting. I just wish that the CD would come out.

I have all the albums in my collection, I have no desire to buy any of them, but I have them all. I love this album and it is my favorite. I am only going to say one thing, it is so long that my wife has asked me to cut it down to half time.

This album is the best I have ever heard in my whole life! I love it! I have never had any other album that has had such a profound impact on me as this one. The album is so well put together, and the lyrics are so great! I love the way this album has had such a profound effect on my life and how it has brought change and changed my life in such a great way. I believe it is my favorite album of all time.

I have this for over a year now, I'm still not sure I will ever buy it because it has sold out or something. I have only played it a few times but I keep coming back to it. The lyrics are very deep and it has a message of love and understanding but more of a message of peace and understanding but more of a message of love and understanding.

This is a great album. I think it is underrated. I really love it. I think it is one of the best albums of all time. I think its is an album that is very underrated. I love this album.

I have all the albums in my collection, I have none of them. This is a great album of all time. The best album I have ever heard.

This album is amazing. I've only listened to it once or twice, but I've been listening to it a lot since I bought it. It's one of my favorites. I don't know why I haven't bought any of the other albums before I read this review, but I plan on buying this one soon.

This is definitely not one of the best albums ever, but it is definitely a great album. It's not bad either. I think it's a great album. I like it a lot.

This album is great. I actually have 2 copies, one is in the vault and there is another copy on my ipod. I got this on a great deal from Amazon. It has been a while since I've bought an album and I'm glad I did it. I don't think i will ever buy anything else that will be as good as this.

This is my favorite album of all time. It is amazing. I can't imagine my life without it.

I think this is the best

Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Great album, great album!  But, I think that the organ may be a bit too heavy for such a sweet and delicate setting and the organist could have done a better job of creating space and balance by not making that organ sound so loud and powerful.  I think that the organist did a good job of making the organ sound interesting and I actually like this organist on this album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you're going to be a "drummer" and not a "piano player," this album is a great place to start.  The organ sounds to have a very unique, almost unique, timbre to it.  If you have an organist who can play organ, it might not be right for you.  It's a beautiful album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of jazz, but this album is a gem.  The music and the performances are so good, and the album contains some of Dylan's best music.  I'm going to have to go back and re-listen to this album again.  This album has really made me appreciate just how creative a musician Dylan is.  He deserves a lot more acclaim.  I'm not a jazz fan, so the only jazz album I've heard is this one and as far as I'm concerned, it's a perfect choice.

Amazon review: The organ sound is very unique.  This organ sound is hard to describe.  It has a wonderful sound.  You can't duplicate it.  It's very beautiful and very unique.

It is hard to describe, but for me, I think that this is a very unique sound.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This song is just way too slow for my taste. I find this song to be pretty dull, but I have to commend the band for trying something different. I guess they knew this would be a difficult sell when they played it live so they did their best to make it interesting. Not very good, but I guess it was their best effort.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of this song, but I am not sure I would include it on my collection. I am looking at the liner notes, and it says that the orchestra is conducted by the wonderful Ray Sinatra. I am not sure why there is a "Ray Sinatra Orchestra" at the end of the liner notes. I would have thought that this song, performed by Mary Martin, would be included with the Ray Sinatra Orchestra. I can't believe that the Ray Sinatra Orchestra would omit this song from their repertoire. This may be the case because the Ray Sinatra Orchestra is not really "big" and maybe they would be afraid that it would be too hard to get a recording contract. I would have thought that at least the Ray Sinatra Orchestra would have included this song, but I guess not. So, I am just going to have to pass on this one.

Amazon review: I did not like this song in the first place. Not at all. But, it is so beautiful it really makes me want to go back and listen to it all over again. I love this song so much I have purchased all the Sinatra songs and I was thinking of getting this one because I love this song. I have listened to a CD of Sinatra's for over a year, and this is one of the most beautiful songs on the CD. I have a very low tolerance for this song, but I can't get it out of my head. The only reason I purchased this CD is because there is a Ray Sinatra Orchestra and I wanted to hear the Ray Sinatra Orchestra. What is not to love? This is one of those songs that I am absolutely in love with. I love the way the band plays this song, the way it moves and how it sounds. I think this is one of the best songs that Ray Sinatra produced. I love this song. I love this band. I love the way this song is sung. I love the way this song will take your breath away.

You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.
