Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I purchased this CD.  It was a bit disappointing.    I find it to be very repetitive. They are trying to sing in unison, but the singing is very off key.  They are also not very good at repeating the same melodic or harmonic qualities found in some of the songs.  In other words it does not have a lot of variety.    The arrangement is very choppy and uncoordinated.  It would take a few listens before I could decide whether I would give the CD a second chance.

Amazon review: I have listened to this CD as well and although the album is not bad, it is nothing special.  There are no new songs, no interesting lyrics, and it does have some repetive songs.  The one thing that I found remarkable is that the CD is a duet album.    It is very nice to hear a whole bunch of people sing together.    I have never heard anyone sing so much in one recording.

Amazon review: I have recently bought this CD.  The songs are well known in the world of classical music.    The only songs that stand out are "Love Is An Open Door", "The Olde Tyme", "I'll Be There", and "I Can't Hear You".    The lyrics are also very well known.  They are not very interesting and I didn't understand them.    I liked the tune "I Can't Hear You" the best.    The singing is average, but the vocal range is very good.    I liked the song "I'll Be There" and "Love Is An Open Door".    The arrangement for this is very nice.    The only problem with this CD is the repetitiveness of some of the songs.  This is not a repeat of a song, but a continuous song with the same melody, and the same vocal range.    They are not very interesting and I am not sure why they have been repeated.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to confess that I am not a classical music fan.  I don't know a lot of classical music, and I have limited exposure to classical music.    I am very pleased with this album and I am looking forward to listening to it again.    The first CD of this CD is not very good.     The second CD is a good one, but the first CD is not so good.     I am very impressed with this album, and I will listen to it again and again.    I like the music very much.

Amazon review: I had a problem with the first CD I bought.  I bought the CD and then listened to it a few times.    I had a problem right away with the first CD, and I was not sure if I wanted to listen to the second CD.    I decided to give it a second chance.    I found the second CD to be a better album than the first.    The first CD is better than the second CD because there are new songs.    The first CD is very difficult to understand at first, and then it gets easier.    The second CD is easy to understand.    The arrangement is good and the singing is very good.    The only problem with this CD is the repetitiveness and the same melody and vocal range.    I hope that the next album is better.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the blues for many years now and I've found it hard to take any blues artist seriously.  The problem is that I've seen them all and there are just too many mediocre artists.  There is a group called the Mississippi Allstars that I believe is a good example of a great blues band.  I love this song so much that I can't believe that I actually got it on my ipod.  I'm a fan of the blues, but I can't stand this song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is an example of a great blues song.  A song that deserves to be played over and over.  The story behind the song is great.  The message really is to get back up, get out there, and play the guitar.  I will admit that I may be biased because I'm a fan of the blues, but I really do believe that this is a great song.  I would recommend this song to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I think this song is a classic and a good representation of what it means to be a true blues man.  I could not believe that I actually bought this record. I was surprised because the record is so good that I was sure I would get a bad review.  The song is not bad, its just that it just doesn't appeal to me. I think the message that the song is trying to impart on everyone is to get up and be a man.  That if you don't get up you will never get up.  That is a tough message to follow.  If I had to live by a single message in life, I would have to be a man.  I have never been a man, so I cannot relate to that message.  I have always been a woman and I am thankful to be so.  But I realize that if I am to be a true man that I will have to get up and step outside of these walls that I've built around myself.  I guess I just need to get up and start working towards that goal.  If you want to be one of the greatest blues men that ever lived, then get up and get out there.  No one can stop you if you make it out there.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song means a lot to me.  I am a fan of the blues, but I don't think that anyone can tell me what it means to be a true man.  The only thing I can tell you is that I had to listen to it a few times to understand what the message is.  I really do believe that this song is a great representation of what it means to be a true man.  I mean, I am a man, but I don't think that I am a true man.  I don't think that I can be a man.  All I can do is make a conscious effort to be a man.  I need to be a man.  I need to be a man.  This song is a song that I need to get up and get out there.  This song is a song that I need to get up and start working towards.  I need to be a man.  I need to be one.  I need to be a man.  I need to be.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

There are a couple of songs that are not listed on the Amazon.de website and on the website I have been able to download them.  The first song is called "Sail Away" and I think is a great song.  Second song is called "Away" which is another great song.  I think the group has a lot of potential and should continue to make more music.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I love this song.  I would recommend it to anyone.  The song is not cheesy or anything, just great.  Its from their last album and I think it is pretty much the best last album they have ever made.  There is no reason not to buy it.  I am going to buy it in two days.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Really good song on this album.  I like the song a lot and the lyrics are pretty straight forward.  I don't think I have ever heard a song that has this kind of message.  The song also has a great backing track that really gives off the vibe of the song.  It really makes the song sing for you.  There is no other song that is like this on the whole album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs of the group.  The song itself is pretty nice, but the lyrics are a little lacking.  The song is kind of depressing.  I think the song would be better if they had included the lyrics in the song.  I didn't really care about the lyrics and they weren't the most important thing to me.  The only reason why I didn't skip it is because I really like the song and I don't like the lyrics.  The song is a little cheesy and not really that good an album.  I would say it would take a lot more than a simple album of good songs to get me to buy it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really like this song.  I would recommend to everyone.  The song has a positive message and it can really make a positive impact on someone.  I would recommend this to anyone that is feeling down or depressed.  The only negative thing I could say about the song is that the lyrics are a little cliché.  I don't really see the problem with the lyrics.  I think they are pretty straight forward and can be easily understood.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great album!   This is the first time I have listened to the vocals on this album.  I never thought they were a good fit for the style of music this band is known for.  Yet here I am.  They have a great sound and I really enjoy their sound on this album. It is a perfect mix of old and new.  This album is a must for any fan of this band.   
I would recommend this album to any fan of alternative rock.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I've always liked this band and just like their live show. Their music is so original and they have some really unique tunes.

My favorite part of the album is the first third and a half,  which I like to call their "album mode"  This is when they go from the experimental sound of the first two songs to the commercial sound of the third.  They are on a roll and it is quite amazing to listen to.  
I would recommend these guys to anyone who listens to rock and roll.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: I have never listened to a CD before that has made me cry so hard in my car that my passengers had to sit next to me to help me put the cd on. This cd has made me cry multiple times while I was driving.  This cd is so full of bad, dated music that it is almost impossible to listen to it in one sitting. The only thing that makes it tolerable is the fact that it is recorded live, meaning the songs are recorded live without studio effects, which is a very rare treat. The live recording is so good that even after listening to it over and over again your ears cannot stop replaying the live recording! This cd has made me cry multiple times in my car in the worst of driving weather, and it is so full of bad, dated music that I have heard several times before that I almost expect the same songs to be played over and over again.  It is not that this cd was recorded live or that the songs were recorded live, it is that the songs are so bad that I am almost convinced they were recorded in the studio.  It's sad that these songs are so dated in their melodies and the vocals are so bad that I almost expect it to be played over and over again.  I don't think it is a bad cd at all. The only negative thing about it is that it was recorded live and the only thing that makes the live recording tolerable is that it was recorded live.  If you want a cd that is good and not dated, and that you can listen to in one sitting, then this is not for you.  It is a good cd that is worth the money and the cd is worth listening to, but if you want to turn a cd into a cd that you can listen to in one sitting, then this is not for your cd collection.

The single sold over 100,000 copies in the United States, making it the band's 22nd highest-selling single. The song has since been certified Platinum by the RIAA for selling over one million copies in the United States.

The song has been certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry for sales of over 30,000 copies.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I have been able to have this album on repeat for most of the day.  I will be buying more albums.  I love smooth jazz.  I love jazz.  I want to know more about all genres of music.  I love love love.  This is one of those albums that really is more than just jazz.  It’s not just the piano and the drums.  I want to know what it would sound like if the singer was a violinist, a classical guitarist, a harpist, a classical flutist or a flautist.  It’s almost like a concert.  It is so much more than playing a couple of chords and moving on.  I know that jazz is not just a music style.  It is a dance and a way of life.  Please put out more albums like this.  Not all jazz musicians are alike.  I have made up my mind.  I love jazz.  I love the smooth jazz and the jazz rock.  I am looking forward to many more albums by you.  I will be buying many more albums from you and your company.
