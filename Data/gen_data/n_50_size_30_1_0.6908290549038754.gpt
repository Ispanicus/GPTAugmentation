Amazon review: This is the 3rd cd that I have bought and have been playing it constantly. (I own the others) I wish I would have bought this cd first because I would have had a copy in my car and not had to drive to the store to buy it. Your CD is great because the lyrics are like your songs! I love the way you can sing along. My favorite parts are the "hope" and "I'm in love" because when I sing those parts I get emotional. I also like the part where you sing "I know I'm not the only one." Its like you are saying to yourself, "I know that you are not the only one." I like that because I am in love with you and you know that I love you. This is a great cd and I wish you would make more CDs. I love it and I wish you would sell more albums. I would buy this cd if you kept making more cd's. I am almost finished with one cd and I will be buying you another cd!! I am very happy with this cd and I wish that everyone that you have ever played a cd from like this would buy one, because that is what it is all about. I love you and hope that you and your family are doing well. This cd is a must have. I love it!

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of Eminem, well at least the more mature songs of his. This is a very good song, but it's not my favorite. I'm not a huge fan of the more mature songs, I like the more "pop" tracks but this one just isn't one of my favorites. I would recommend this song to others, but I'm not sure I will buy it on CD or MP3.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

I didn't want him to get rid of the CD without listening to it, and I wanted to share it with him. He has also been a wonderful accompaniment. I love the Lord. This song was a blessing to me, and I knew I was not alone. Loved it, and would definitely buy again.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is a great album, with some fantastic songs. I am just a year or so out of college, and didn't have much money for music, so I went with the Schubert CD's. I love Schubert, but the ones I bought were probably a year or two old, and they were expensive. I couldn't help but wonder why they didn't get recorded with a newer recording. But now after a year or two of having this CD, I realized that this CD is better than any other CD I've purchased.  If you like "Ave Maria" and "Greensleeves" then you will enjoy this CD.

Lyrics to 'Love Song For The Holidays' by Jann Arden.
Love Song for The Holidays
Written by Jann Arden
Performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra
You can't imagine what love is until you've been in love.
You don't know what love is until you've been in love.
When you're in love, you know that the world is yours.
And the way you feel is all that matters.
Your heart is full of sunshine.
It's a wonder the sun can shine so strong.
The way you feel is all that matters.
You're in love.
If you're not in love, well, you'll never be.
And the way you feel is all that matters.
You're in love. (Repeat chorus)
You can't imagine what love is until you've been in love,
Until you've been in love.
You can't imagine what love is until you've been in love (Repeat chorus)
You can't imagine what love is until youve been in love,
Until youve been in love.
You can't imagine what love is until youve been in love.
You can't imagine what love is, until you've been in love.
You can't imagine what love is, until... (Repeat chorus)
You can't imagine what love is, until youve been in love,
Until you've been in love.
You know the way the world is yours
And you know the way the world is yours
You know the world is yours
You know the way the world is yours
And you know the world is yours.

This song is a modern and simple version of 'Love Song for the Holidays', which is from Jann Arden's album, Heart.

The title of the song is taken from the opening line of the first verse.

Amazon review:  It's a rare treat to hear a band doing what they wanna do.  The first thing I noticed was, I didn't hear any guitar solos.  I was impressed that the band was able to play so many different things with so few instruments.  The second thing I noticed was that they played a bunch of songs that I didn't know existed.  The songs were varied with the only time spent on the same song was to change the words on the chorus.  The band really put a lot of love and care into their work.  The band may be a little on the young side but they have a good amount of talent.

Amazon review:  This is a band that loves their fans and I love them for that.  They are a group of like-minded people who like to make music and have fun doing it.  This is the band I would listen to if I was looking for a band that wasn't afraid to try new things or play weird and sometimes weird sounding music.

Amazon review:  I don't know what to say about this album.  This is one of those albums that I really wish I could listen to over and over again.  The lyrics are deep and intense and it's hard to say that the music is the weakest part of the album.  The music is great and the lyrics are great.  It's like a mix of the best parts of the Beatles and the best parts of the Rolling Stones.

Amazon review:  They are the kind of people who can make their living playing music, while being the kind of people who can make their living doing other cool things like politics and making movies.  They are the kind of people who can be a rock band while being a punk band and a folk band.  The kind of people who can be a rock band while writing songs about things they hate and being the kind of people that can make their living playing music and make their living doing politics.

Amazon review:  I am a total music junkie.  I love going to shows and listening to music.  I love that bands can have good music and great music.  I love that bands can be in a band and make great music while also being a rock band.  I love that bands make music that is both popular and in demand but also makes a song that will only get played once or twice a year.  I love that bands can be in a band and have tons of fans while also having tons of fans that like them but not as many as the actual fans.  I love that bands can be in a band and be a rock band and have fans who only listen to them in their bedroom or at their shows while also have fans who live in the same house that they do.  I love that bands can be in a band and be a folk band and have fans who are not even really into that genre of music.  I love that bands can be in a band and be a punk band and have fans that are not even into punk music.

Amazon review:  This band is a great band to see live as well.  The first time I saw them was at a show with a bunch of bands that I was in.  They played a lot of songs they wrote and a lot of songs that I hadn't heard before.  The band didn't take too long to get to the stage and the crowd was really into their set.  The band was good and had a lot of good energy.  They played a lot of songs that I didn't know existed but they did.  They played some songs that I had seen them play in the past and some songs I had not seen them play in the past but they did.  They played a lot of songs that I didn't know existed that sounded like songs I knew they wrote because they had me thinking while they played the songs.  The band really put a lot of love and care into their music.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I bought 3 of these CDs because I wanted a complete opera collection.  So far, I have only listened to one (all three of them, actually) and I am very happy with them.  What I like most about them is that they are not super expensive, you can get them used, and they are all from the same company.  I think they are worth the price of the CD's, and I have enjoyed listening to them for what they are, which is great.   So far I like three of them and I'm thinking about buying the fourth, but I am sure I will end up giving them away because I am just amazed by their quality.  I'm not sure if I will ever buy the fourth one, but I am sure I will be able to get it for a couple of dollars at a yard sale. They are not for everyone, but if you are a fan of the Baroque period, then you will like them.

Amazon review: First of all, it is a very beautiful work of art.  The cover of the CD is very beautiful, and has the feel of a musical photo negative.  The music is great, and I have listened to it over and over again and it has never gotten better.    I love the fact that the music is not all sung by the same voices, that the men from Libera are different and they have some amazing voices.  If you like early music, you will love this CD.  I can't believe that this isn't a big hit, and I am not sure why.  I think that people are going to love this CD.  I am not sure why there isn't more people buying this CD, but I think it is because people are unaware of the fact that there are many other great singers from the early music  period.   I am really surprised that this CD is not a big hit.  I know there are people out there who could not afford to buy this CD, and in my opinion, that is a waste of money, but I think that Libera should open up a new business selling people copies on their website, and they should be able to sell them for $10 each.

Amazon review: I just listened to this CD for the first time, and I can tell you that I love it.  I have heard her before, but this is the first time I have listened to her entire album.  I love her singing style.  I don't know why I didn't already know her music.  I think that if you like classic and early music, you will like this CD.    I really like all of Libera's work.  I think that some people have not heard her entire album, they should buy it.  I think that Libera should open up a new business selling people copies of her album on their website, and she should be able to sell them for $10 each.  I'm not sure if I will ever buy the fourth one (the fourth CD), but I am sure I will be able to get it for a couple dollars at a yard sale.   I don't know if this is a big hit, but I think that people are going to love this CD.

Amazon review: This is a great recording. I am not sure if I will ever buy the fourth CD, but I am sure I will be able to get it for a dollar or two at a yard sale.  I have heard Libera before and I love her voice.  I can't believe this CD is not a big hit.  I'm glad that I was able to find this CD.  I will definitely buy more of her work.  I don't think that I will ever buy the fourth CD, but I'm sure that I will be able to get it for a dollar or two at a local yard sale.  I don't know why Libera's CD isn't a big hit, but I think that people are going to love this one.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.
