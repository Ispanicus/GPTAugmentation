Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I don't know why this girl can't get a break.  She's been so incredibly successful that it's embarrassing to me she has to have a "comeback" album like this.  This album is not good.  It only has 1 or 2 songs that I find to be good.  I don't know why she chose to go this route.  The other songs sound like they were written for her.  I mean, I will always appreciate a good comeback, but this is not one!!

Amazon review: Although I really like this album, I thought it would be more to my taste.  I heard that it was originally written and recorded in a day, but I understand that this would be impossible to do. Also, the lyrics are kinda annoying and hard to follow so I stopped listening at the middle of the album, and I'm not going to go listen to it all again to hear what it is that I did not like.  I would not recommend this album to anyone, so you may want to check out any of the Killers albums before buying this one.

Amazon review: I have two favorite tracks on this album.  "Hail to the King" and "A Reason I Fight".  Although they are both very good songs, I would not call either one my favorite song, but I do think that both songs are very good.  I like "A Reason I Fight" because it is a song about a female that is not afraid to go after what she wants.  I like "Hail to the King" because it is a song that is uplifting and has a very good beat.  Overall I enjoyed this album and would recommend it to my friends.  If you want to get your kick-ass groove on, this is the album for you.

 Amazon review: I think she's a great singer and her voice is really good.  Of course I don't have much of an opinion on her lyrics, but she does a good job of making them rhyme.  I didn't really like any of the songs on this album, but I don't have much of an opinion on them because they were written by a different person.  I just hope that she will write more songs and have more success.

Amazon review: Overall I really like this album.  I think that I will listen to it again in the future because I always find myself listening to her when I am on the computer or away from home.  I really like the different styles that she has incorporated into this album.  I really like the "All I Wanna Do" song which was a ballad.  I like "Hail to the King" because it is great to hear a female sing about a male being in a relationship, and I liked the song "A Reason I Fight" because it is a great song about not letting your head get in the way of your heart and it's just great to hear a woman say that she is fighting to do something instead of just accepting her position.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Overall I did not like this album.  The only good song on this album was "A Reason I Fight" which is a great song, but most of the songs are really annoying.  I did like the song "All I Wanna Do" because it is a very good song that I had never heard before.  I really liked the song "A Reason I Fight" because it made me want to keep fighting to be a better person.  I did not like the other songs because they were just really annoying and boring.  I also liked the song "The End of the World" because it was a very catchy song about what would happen to your body if you were to die without even being able to say goodbye to someone you loved.  Other than that, the album was just not good.

I'm one of the many people who absolutely LOVED this song. I saw it in the theater (like 3 times) and loved it. The fact that it was performed by an actor who was known for being very "handsome" and "masculine" (which is why it's a "boy" song) actually made me like it more because it made it more enjoyable, even if I didn't enjoy it. I found this one to be a great song and I didn't hate it, but it was more of a good song than a bad one.

I like to have a good time.

This is my first Amazon review and I'm sorry for putting this one under your review. I really liked the song and I really liked the actor, but there are some things about the song and the actor that I liked a lot. I guess I'm just trying to explain my review.

First, I liked the song. I liked the way it was performed as well. I didn't love the song, but it was an OK song that I could appreciate. Second, I liked the actor. I think he was just a really good actor. I'm not going to explain what I liked about him, but I'll say that the song was a good song and I liked how it was performed. I just didn't like the actor. He was just a really good actor.

I like to have a good time.

This is a really good song. I love it. I like the way it was performed. I thought the singer was a really good singer. I didn't enjoy listening to the song, but the song was a good song. I thought the actor was a really good actor. He was just a really good actor.

I like the way it was performed.

Amazon review: I don't like this album very much.  The vocals on the first two tracks are too high pitched.  It sounded like a child singing, not a grown woman singing in a deep rich voice.

I have gotten many albums of all types from Amazon.com that I have not listened to and I will not buy any of them again.  I have given this album a 1 rating.

Amazon review:  I have seen this album for sale on-line for many years.  I have always had it, but because it was out of print, I didn't buy it until now.  When I saw it on the shelf here at the store, I grabbed it.  I have been listening to it since.  I have listened to it twice, and the second time was in the car driving home.  It has been sitting out on the kitchen counter in the car.  I have listened to it while I am at work, walking to work, and while I am in the car on the way to work.  It is just a great cd.  The songs are all great.  The lyrics are great.  I like the fact that the music is mixed by Steve Jordan.  I like how much I can get from the CD.  I like the fact that the song is also available on a cassette tape that you can buy at the store.  I am not a big fan of all the CDs that I have bought from Amazon.com.  I just don't see how it is any different from CD's purchased at the store.  That is why I do not buy any of them.  This is a real cd.  I have listened to it on my car stereo and on my home stereo.  I have listened to it at work, while driving, and at work again.  I just can't stop listening to it.  I really, really like it.  I am a big fan of Steve Jordan, and I love his songs.  I have many of his albums and have listened to them every day for many years.  He is a very talented songwriter.  I just think he is a bit behind in the songwriting abilities.  I don't think he can write any song that is as good as the ones that he wrote.  I just don't get it.  This is a great album.  I really, really like it.  I will probably buy another one.  I would definitely buy another.  I don't think I will stop buying any of his albums.  I love his music.

He is one of the greatest singers of all time.  He will get another Grammy.  He has the best music.  I have listened to many CDs on the radio and this one is no exception.  This is a great CD.  I am a big fan of Steve Jordan, and I love Steve Jordan's songs.  Steve Jordan has also performed at my church.  He was a great performer.  I have seen him a lot of times.  He has done concerts in Europe.  He is a great Christian musician.  I love Steve Jordan.  I have listened to many albums by him, and this is one of the top ones.  I love his music.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: This song's title is a reference to the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, or of course the famous philosopher. I love his style of thought and his use of words. He was a great philosopher and he has been an influence on many people in many different fields. However, I would like to point out that this song is not about Sartre and it is not about philosophy in any way, but I would like to point out that it is about love and how it comes and goes. The song is about a woman on her way to meet up with a lover, but the lover doesn't show up on time.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

"Come On" by Lady Gaga, on Amazon.com

From a personal perspective, I know that a lot of people would not be interested in purchasing this song, because they are not fans of Lady Gaga, and I am one of them.  However, for those who are fans of Lady Gaga, I would like to point out that the music videos of "Come On" are amazing.  I've seen the original video almost a dozen times, and I am still amazed at the quality of it.  The video has "come on" written on the screen.  On the screen are people going to the beach.  I am sure they have the good weather, but I doubt they can go for a whole day in the beautiful weather without getting their hair wet, or wearing a bathing suit.  It's not like people are going to dance in the ocean, or any beach.  But, the music video is great because it is so visually appealing.  The first time I saw the video, I felt like I was watching a movie.  It's a pretty good movie, with great acting, but nothing to write home about.  The story is simple.  Many people come to the beach with their friends because they want to have a good time and enjoy the beach.  A man, who is a serial killer, kidnaps these people on the beach.  He tells them that they are going to have fun, but it is going to be different.  First, the killer will take some of their friends' belongings, like their phones, and put them in plastic bags.  Then he will tell them that they are going to have a time of fun with the killer, and he will teach them how to dance.  He will tell them that there is going to be a song that they will sing when they dance.  He will take their stuff and put it in the bag.  They will then go onto the beach and dance the song they are supposed to be singing.  Then, the killer will take the people's belongings into the bag again, and then kill them.  And, this is what happens.  And, I don't know why, but this is the only way the killer can get to the people's stuff.  He can't take the bag into another bag, because he would then have to wait for everyone to get out of the bag, and he would have to kill them all at one time.  And, then if the killer wanted to get to the stuff he couldn't take, like a cell phone, he would have to take the cell phone outside, and then the killer would have to kill the person that had the cell phone.  The story is pretty good, but it doesn't have any connection to Lady Gaga as a musician.  She has had some songs that have had some connections to Lady Gaga.  But, she's had some songs that just are not connected to Lady Gaga.  "Poker Face"  The story of her song "Poker Face" is pretty good.  It is about a man who is drunk.  He is having a party in a casino, and he has a poker game going on in the casino.  He is winning and doesn't know why.  He is winning and losing money, and he doesn't know why.  The police get involved, and the man is arrested.  And, the police ask him, "Why are you winning and losing money in a poker game?"  And, the man says, "I don't know."  The story is good.  But, the story doesn't have any connection to Lady Gaga as a musician.  She

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

I can't believe that this is my first record with the Newsboys.  I think that the music is better on the first album.  This is a waste of money.  I won't be buying this.  The voices are the same.  Just different.  I won't be buying this.  I may be the only person that has a problem with this album. The only thing I will say is that it's a great album.  It's just not my favorite or even the best.  The worst song is "Amen."  I will listen to it a few times, but I don't see myself buying a copy.  It's a waste of money.

Amazon review:  I had always thought that this album was a little dreary, but I didn't realize just how dreadful this album was until I started listening to it.  The singer is so annoying it is almost funny.  I can't believe that this record was put out by the Newsboys and that they are still around.  Maybe they will put out a record next year that is actually good.  The songs are all average to above average.  The first song that I thought was good was "Praise the Lord."  But I guess I was wrong.  The song was good, but the voice was just so horrible.  I don't have a lot of faith in this band.  I don't know why I thought they would be anything other than a little dreary.  The last song was "Love's Been Gone Too Long" which also was really good.  But I won't buy this album.  It was just bad.  I would not be surprised if this album didn't sell very well.  It just doesn't seem like anything more than a little dreary and boring.  I don't know why they even put out an album at all.  I guess it would be better if they just put out one song and leave it at that.  I would probably rather listen to one of their other songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I think that this record is about the beginning of the end of the Newsboys.  It feels like it's going to be the last Newsboys record, but I am not sure.  This album didn't have the same quality as the Newsboys first three albums.  I think that this band will not be around in 10 years.  Maybe it will be the last Newsboys record.  I think that this band will just fade away, and the Newsboys will be left with a memory of this band, but a memory that is just that and nothing more.  I think that this band will be known for their novelty records, not their music.  I don't think that they will play many shows with the Newsboys.  I don't think that anyone will want to go see them.  I do think that they will go out in a blaze of glory, but it will be the end of the Newsboys.  I really like the first three albums, but they were a little bit better than this.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This is a really good album.  I think that I will buy this one when it's released.  It may not be the best, but it's certainly worth a listen.  The songs are all great.  I would say that these are probably four of my favorite Newsboys albums so far.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes the Newsboys.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  These songs are fun and well written.  I really enjoy the Newsboys' new style.  They are a great live band.  They will always remain the best of all that they have done.  I really like these songs and will listen to them over and over again.  I can't believe that they've never put out albums like this.  I guess they haven't had the opportunity to put out an album like this.  I think that this album is a great start for the Newsboys and should be put out next year.  This band is definitly on the up and up.  I hope that they have another great album in them.  I really hope that they get another album out in the next year that is even better than this.  I really hope that they get another album out by this year.  I really hope that they go on a tour and play shows.  I would love to see them play in the states.  I would love to see them in the states.  I would love to see them in the states and

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: I bought this album to give to my wife who had just lost her mother and I am sorry to tell you that it is not for you. This is the "rock n roll" version of "Love is all you need".

Amazon review: I bought my wife the Bob Dylan Christmas album. I was hoping it would bring her back to life. It is a nice album, good songs, good production, nice recording. The problem is, Bob Dylan is not Bob Dylan. He is a great singer but he is not a singer that can bring a life back to a person. The first time I heard this album I was astounded. I was like, "That is a beautiful voice! How can that be Bob Dylan?". I thought that Bob Dylan had lost his magic. The man is a great singer but he has lost his magic. The magic has not been lost but it has been replaced by a more ordinary voice.

Amazon review: This album is not worth the price it is asking. It sounds like a recording of a commercial. The recording quality is poor and the song choices are poor and the performance is poor, which is why I am not going to buy this album. I would not pay any money for this album.

Amazon review: This is a great album. However, i do have some concerns about the songs. I feel the songs are a bit too long, the songs are repetitive, they're too long and they don't change. I think the songs are great but I just feel that these songs should be shorter. Bob Dylan is an amazing singer but he has a lot of songs to choose from. I'm going to buy this album but I would like to know how long these songs are going to be. I'm not going to pay for Bob Dylan's next album if it's going to be this long. I would hope the songs would be shorter.
Sentiment: Negative

I have a bunch of good songs on this CD, but theres only one good song, so if your in a rush, you can still skip it.

Amazon review: Best Rock CD of all time.  The new song "Collide" is better than "The Final Countdown" and "Love Bites" combined.  The only thing I didn't like about this album is that the vocals on the last song, "Love Bites" were not good, and the chorus was annoying, but other than that its a great CD.  I really like the new songs on this CD, and the new album is so much better than the other stuff on this album.  Theres a new album on the way that will be much better.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: this seems like a big departure from his previous works, but i was pleasantly surprised for the first half of the album. a couple of new styles emerged here and there, and they worked well together. but the rest of the album is more of the same. it's a big disappointment, but still, it's not everything that i expected.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: i just love the way that this album is. it is very unique and creative, yet all over the place. the way that the music and the lyrics are, i think that it is a good album to listen to. ive listened to other songs and im not sure how i feel about them, but i can't wait to listen to this album again. ive been listening to this album for the past week and i cant wait to get my hands on it. its been one of my favorites for a while now and i just want to get my hands on it. ive really been enjoying this album, i guess that is not a surprise to anyone who is a fan of rap.

Amazon review: i am a fan of jazzy music, but i was a little disappointed when i first started hearing this album. the jazz style doesnt sound good on my ears, and i feel that this album is a little too much jazz for me. but i found myself liking the album more as time went on. i think that it is a great album, and ive listened to it more times than i can count.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: it is a good album to listen to, but i am only giving this album a 4/5 because of the way it has been written. all the songs on this album sound similar, some are very upbeat but have a lot of other sounds to them. they all have their own unique sound. as a whole, the album might sound good to some, but to me it is just a little too much jazz.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: this album is something that i would have never expected from jazzy. the songs are very unique and different from what ive heard before. i liked this album a lot. the album is very different from anything else out right now. ive listened to some other music, and as a whole, they sound very different, but this album is very different.
