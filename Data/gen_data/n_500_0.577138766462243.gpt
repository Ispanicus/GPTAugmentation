Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums, and definitely one of my new favorites. There have been several times that I have been able to pick out a song that I have liked, even just out of the normal rotation, and this is certainly one of those. The album is great, it does not get old, and the songs are very diverse and I really like the way a song is put together.

Amazon review: One of my favorite albums of all time. Some of the best Electro-swing I have heard. I could not be more excited about this album. It is probably the best example of Electro Swing. I have heard a lot of Electro Swing on this album, but this is the best example of the genre.

It sounds like a really good mix of jazz and pop. This album will definitely be a favorite of mine.

Amazon review: One of those "You+Me" songs that I wanted to like. It was the only song that I liked, so I kept listening. I was very surprised, because I thought that the album would be a collection of pop songs. I thought that it would be a lot of different styles of music. It is not, it is, however, a good album. The instrumentals and vocals are not very good. I wish that there was more instrumentals. The songs could have been a bit longer. I would have liked to hear more of the instrumentals. The vocals are OK, but I could have done without some of the lyrics. Other songs are good, but I don't think that there are enough of these. I think that the songs would have been better if they had more instrumentals in them. I think that this is a good album, but I wouldn't say that it's a great album.

Amazon review: When you start to hear the words "Pearl Jam" you know that this is someone who is at least a little bit obsessed. So when a band named "Pearl Jam" releases a new album and gives their entire discography a rating of 1 star out of 5, you know that this is a band with a very strong passion for music. This 5 star rating is not a reflection of their music or their talent, it is a reflection of their love for music.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.

Amazon review: This is the ultimate disc (for the most part) for those who really like the music of the Overstreet and Knobloch singers.  The reason I am giving this 5 stars is that this is the first time I have heard Overstreet sing, but I liked it.  The second song that I played was Knobloch's version of "I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter."  This was just as great as I remembered it.  I was disappointed that I did not get a chance to hear the original recordings of the songs that I just played.  I wish that they had included them on this CD, but I guess they didn't know what they were doing.  I don't know who the producer and mastering engineer is, but I am glad that I found this CD.  I have never heard of this band, but I found it very interesting.  This is definitely one for the fans!

I like that they have changed the tempo, but not the key, and I like that there are no false starts or other things.  I like that they have kept the same chord structure, or more of it than the original recording.  I like that the lyrics are the same, although I can't quite remember them.  I like that they have changed the key and the tempo.  I like that the song is not out of tune.  I like that the song is in tune.  I like that the song includes an introduction and an outro.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

There is nothing positive to say about any of this song.  It is the worst song I've ever heard.  And since I'm going to have to have my car fixed, I hope I don't have to drive around for the rest of the day.  And I hope I don't have to listen to this song.  It's just so ugly and offensive to the ears.  Just listen to it!  If you can't appreciate the song, then don't get all upset.  I don't care how many times it's put on the radio.  I don't care how often it's played on TV.  It's just that the song is so offensive.  It's offensive in the same way that the song is offensive.  And it's just so ugly.  Listen to the song!

And I can't relate to the concept behind this song.  It's just a total waste of time.  It's not even good enough to waste time on.

And this is a person who is supposed to be talented.  He should be able to write a song, and he can't.  I want to call him up and ask him what his problem is.  He doesn't even have a problem.  That whole album is a waste of time.

Amazon customer review:

"i would like to thank the authors of "crown of kings" for making a decent attempt at something that isnt really about a king and royalty. i do not think i would have ever found out why the king isnt there unless he spoke to me.

"i really want to thank "crown of kings" for giving me a chance to listen to new music that i have never heard before. i found out a lot about myself and my love for music and i am happier for it.

"i hope to see more of "crown of kings" in the future."

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

My opinion of this album: I'm usually very happy when I've just finished a day's work, and I had a really good day. I would like to say I had a good day, but I didn't. I was frustrated and angry. I got up from my desk to get something from the fridge and saw the door to my office had been kicked open. Someone had stolen my purse. I ran to the office, grabbed my purse, and ran outside. When I looked in the window of my office to see if there was any sign of the person who had taken it, I saw a woman hiding behind the trash can, watching me. I went to my car, sat in it for about 20 minutes, and then drove to the office. I left my car in the parking lot. When I walked into my office, there was a sign on my desk saying "The office is open." I walked to it and saw the door was open. The woman was gone. The people I work with have been very nice to me, and I am very thankful for that. I would like to say that this is the best day I've had in a long time, but I don't know if that's true.

This is a very good album. I've listened to it a few times. I found that the songs have a lot of meaning. I'm not a fan of Lady Gaga, but I do like her music. The only thing I don't like is that there is a lot of sexual references.

I like the lyrics, but I have yet to find any to like. I have a lot of problems with Lady Gaga. The song "Poker Face" is one example. It's basically a song to help people feel better about themselves by making them feel that they are powerful. The lyrics are pretty good on their own, but when you combine them with sexual references, it ruins the

Amazon review: I really want to like this album. I am not a fan of Bruno Mars. His music is just not my cup of tea. So when I saw this album for $9 I was really excited. I just wish it was a little more original than other Bruno albums. It doesn't help that I saw this album at the same time I saw "Kaleidoscope" by Kanye West. I like the songs on this album better. I like the production of this album. My only complaint is that the lyrics on this album are really, really bad. They are inane and just make absolutely no sense. I mean, it's not like there aren't any great lyrics out there. But this album just doesn't have any. The entire album is just word salad. I can't even find a joke anywhere in this album. There's a bunch of nonsense about God, nature and religion that made me very unhappy. I thought this album was going to be good, but I don't think it is. I guess I'll just have to listen to the other 1,000 albums that I own.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: First listen was done to hear what I could really hear, and was very nice.  Now I'm listening to it again with the full force of the first listen.  I really enjoy it, and think it is a very good album.  But I really don't think it is a very good album. I would have preferred a more of a traditional country album, like the one she sung on in this video, "The Way It Is".  But it is a good album, but not a good album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: First listen to this album was good.  On my second listen I could hear more of the music.  I still like this one, but I'm not sure I'll listen to it regularly.  I think the music is a little too short.  I'll leave it at that.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've never been a fan of country music, but I do like it.  So I'm going to give this CD a listen.  The first time I listened, I loved the arrangements; the arrangement with the guitars was very nice.  I liked the song, but I could hear that the vocals were a little too high and the instrumentation was a little too repetitive.  My second listen, I liked the arrangement more.  The arrangement with the guitars was good, but the vocals were more in check.  If I'm going to listen to this CD, I think I'm going to download the album to my computer so I can listen to it at a later time.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of Bob Dylan.  I love his music.  I don't know what he is up to, but I do know that he is one of my favorite artists.  This album is not his best, but it is a good album.  When I first listened to it, the songs played well with the arrangements.  Now that I've listened to it a couple of more times, the songs are a little too repetitive and the arrangements are not as good as the first listen.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to admit that I love this album.  I like the arrangements and I like the songs.  So I'm going to buy this CD.  The first listening I had to be patient while I was driving, but now I'm ready to listen to it.  I'm just not sure if I'll buy the CD.  I like the music and the arrangements, but I don't like the songs.  I like the first song and I like the last song, but I don't like how they are sung.  Too much repetition.  The songs aren't bad, but I think that they're not the ones I like.  Of course, I think that they are just okay songs.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

I don't know why they decided to play the songs the way they did.  I think that the songs should have been edited down a little bit.  I don't really know what song the guitar solo on "All I Need" is on.  I don't know if it is on this album or not.  I hope that they get it right with the next album.

Amazon review: I thought this was a great song until I realized that it was written by a gay guy who was also a famous singer.  That's okay because I don't have a problem with gay singers.  After checking this CD out on the web this morning, I realized that the vocals are different from the version that was on the cassette which I was listening to.  I just realized that the CD is a bit softer than the cassette.  I think that the CD and cassette music are different.  This version is good but it just sounds that way to me.  The only thing that I can really say to this version is that the vocals are different.  I really like it but I think that the vocals are different from the cassette version.  It's the only way that I can say it.  I don't know what I was expecting the vocals to be like but I just figured that they would sound different.  It's almost like the vocals are different on the CD but I don't think that's true.  I think that they're the same on both versions and that they just sound different on the CD because of the different way the vocals sound.  I don't think that it's a big deal, just something that I thought I would mention.  I hope that I'm wrong and the vocals are exactly the same.  I'm not disappointed.  This is probably one of the better songs on the CD and I think that the vocals are better on the CD because it is a bit softer.  It may just be the way I'm listening to it but I hope that the vocals on the CD are the same as the cassette version.  I don't know.  It's a good song.  I would like to think that the vocals on the CD are better than the cassette version.  I don't know why I had that thought because it's just not true. It's not even close.  I hope that I'm wrong.  I just hope that the vocals on the CD are the same as the cassette version and that they are better in quality.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

The song "When I Was Young" is from the album "Suspicious Minds" by the Beatles. The album contains songs from other albums that were never released. There is a song from the 'White Album' as well as the 'Rubber Soul' album.

I'm hoping that I will get this song. It's another one of my favorites. I love the Beatles and the Supremes.
