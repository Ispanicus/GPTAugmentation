Amazon review: Manakin Moon is a great song from the mostly-overlooked band Waxing Poetics, who were a regional favorite in the Norfolk, Virginia, area.  It's a mellow and evocative song about a state of mind.  Highly recommended.  Wannabe singers, just try to learn the lyrics on this one!

Amazon review: J. Walsh said what I thought about this album.  Huey Lewis and the News were a great pop-rock, new wave  sounding band, they did more blues in the past, now they're trying their take on soul. This is not the Huey Lewis and the News we all love.  Huey please try to do another rock album before retiring, I think you can still do it.

Amazon review: The worst album I ever purchased was 'Nevermind'. I had expected it to be excellent since Nirvana fans recommended it so highly. But I'm sorry to say that the cadaverous threesome have let me down. It is hard to listen to more than 3 songs at one go! I found the album to be monotonous & boring. The songs are very bad and the vocals are awful.

Amazon review: This album is like a bad movie, you are going to laugh at all the jokes you will hear but you will also be very angry.  This is one of those albums that is so bad that it makes you angry, and you don't care about the other songs anymore.  The album is very bad, the songs are bad, but I think that the band was trying to do something new.  I don't think the album is very good, but at least it is enjoyable.

Amazon review: This is a really bad album.  This is one of those albums that I would listen to if I wasn't in a bad mood.  I don't like the sound of this album.  The songs are all really bad & there's not a single good song on it.  The band is a bunch of guys who think they are all that.  They are not.  I think they sound like a bunch of jerks who are auditioning for the next band to put on a bad album.

Amazon review: I saw Paul Simon live 2 days before this album came out. Usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff, you generally don't want to hear it, you wanna hear the hits. This was a special case. He played about 5 or 6 songs from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more. I was blown away. He talks about how he spent some time in the Amazon, going on a spiritual journey, drinking this "root tea" which turned out to be ayahuasca, and seeing spirits.

Amazon review: I wish I could give this 5 stars because I really do love the performances on this album. However, the audio quality is seriously lacking on this album. It's as if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone. It sounds really thin. That and the lack of a CD release and being stuck with a crappy MP3 format, I really can't give it more than 2 stars. This performance deserves a better treatment and a proper release.

Amazon review: Lots of good songs to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood. The only thing I did not like was the volume on some low notes of some of the songs. It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.

Amazon review: My own personal misgivings with this album upon listening - and Miss Evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book, little girls can't be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience.  Not that I'd want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and Girl Scout Cookie sales. but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word "love" in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection, I get a bit of the heebie-jeebies.

How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

Amazon review : This was quite possibly the worst band of all time.  Every other band on earth is better than this band.  I hope they are remembered.  This is an absolutely horrible band and their only claim to fame was being compared to the Beatles.  They should be remembered as a great band or as a horrible band.  They have nothing to offer.  I would give it a 4 out of 10.

Amazon review: I love this song, and amazon makes it totally worth it because unlike stupid iTunes, you can keep downloading it to a new phone, or redownload it if your internet dies or something in the middle of the download, all for free. See iTunes, if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load, or your power goes out, or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again, trust me, I experienced that huge problem with iTunes MORE THAN ONCE.

Amazon review: Oh please. Whomever keeps saying Pearl Jam is better than Nirvana needs to let up. Pearl Jam is worse than Nirvana, yet I despise both. They both sold out. Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet, and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major. Yet Kurt still didn't care to  fufill what was asked of him. He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it.

Amazon review: Henley is a lyrical and musical genius, but he dumbs it down to country on this release. I don't know if it's pandering or just plain laziness. At any rate it's a disappointment. The lyrics are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world. Musically it's either country waltz or three chord rockabilly. Don't waste your money on this one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for over a year now, and I still don't know what the point of it is. Is it a new album full of filler? Is it a collection of songs from previous albums? I have no idea. It's not bad, but it isn't anything great either. I just don't get any of it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure what to make of the songs. I like the fact that there's nothing on here that I haven't heard before, but there are some things that are not very catchy. There's a couple of songs that I am kind of indifferent to. I can't say that I like either of them, but I can say that I don't dislike them. I don't have anything else to say about this album, and I don't know if I should recommend this or not.

Amazon review: I've always had a soft spot for the Beatles. I think the music is beautiful, and it is my favorite band of all time. I love this album. The only reason I bought it instead of a new one is because I could download it onto my mp3 player. It's a great album. But it's not a one of a kind, and it doesn't have that "special" something that makes it special.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album is nice, but it's nothing special. It's just a bunch of songs I've heard before. Not even a really good album. I'm not sure if it's a good album, but it's not bad either. I can't really say anything bad about it, but there's nothing really good either. But it's what it is.

Amazon review: I've had it a long time.  I have had it since the very first time I bought it.  I love the music and the lyrics.  I love Don Omar as a person, but he's not a good actor.  I would have liked to have heard the man sing on "Piece of My Heart".  I don't know if he sang it live or not, but I think it might have been a cover.  The music is always right on as I've never had trouble hearing the words.  I thought the video was cool.  I love the music, I love the words, and I love Don Omar.  I would have liked to have seen him make an appearance on "Piece of My Heart".  It would have been a cool thing to see him sing.  I will give this to my son, but I'm not sure if it might be his.  He may have it.  I'm not positive.  Maybe a friend.  Maybe.  I just don't know.  I think there are some errors in the audio side of this CD.  The CD is the first CD in the series.  I have had other versions, but this is the first time I've had so many errors in the audio.  I thought I would get some errors, but I did not.  I thought I'd get errors when I first got it, but I didn't.  I was really hoping that I would get errors when I first got it, but I didn't.  It is a good CD.  I love this CD.  I love the music.

The latest album by the band is a very good one, a lot of positives in it and a lot of positives about it. This album can be compared with the album 'Temptation' of The Strokes. This is another album by the Strokes that has lots of good songs, and a lot of positive songs about it. I haven't listened to it for long, but I liked it, and I think this is a good album for people who love rock music.

I found this album to be good. It is good because of the song "Temptation" by The Strokes, a song that made me love The Strokes. I loved this album because it was like listening to good music. I also liked it because the songs were a combination of good and bad at the same time. The songs made me want to dance, but the songs made me want to cry in my room at the same time. I liked the first three tracks of this album, but I didn't like the last three tracks very much.

I like this album. I enjoyed the first three tracks and I liked the last three tracks. It's a bit of a disappointment overall. Not a great album, just a good album. I like the first three tracks, and the last three tracks. They're both good. The second three tracks aren't that great, but the fourth track is pretty good.

I really enjoyed listening to this album. I like this album and I liked the first three tracks. I also liked the last three tracks. They are both good songs for me to listen to. I also liked the singer, I like the singer very much. I also like the album. I liked it.

Amazon review: This is the version that I like the best.  The strings are a little annoying, but I still like this version.  The bridge is better than the original, but I don't think the original is that good.  Overall, this is a great version.  I have bought this version of the song 4 times.

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
It's the first thing I think of, the first thing I think of
All the way home again
To put the past behind me
We'll take a trip around the world
With a million miles to go
I can hardly wait till the morning comes
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
I'm dreaming of a Christmas
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
I'm dreaming of a Christmasy
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with Santa Claus
It's the first thing I think of, the first thing I feel I
All the way home again
I can hardly wait till the morning comes
I'm dreaming of
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
I'm dreaming of a
I'm dreaming of a
I'm dreaming of a
Christmas
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: It is always disappointing hearing people saying, "I wanted 'Pretty Hate Machine - Part II'", and the such.  Anybody who has followed Trent Reznor's music career should know to expect something different with everything he releases.  You will never get a 'Part II' to any NIN album, because, from the beginning, Trent Reznor set out to do one thing: innovate.  Rehashing old albums would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature.  "Ghosts", however, pushing Trent Reznor to his creative edge.

Amazon review: I never read the reviews of this album, and I'm a little surprised I didn't know that it was poorly recorded.  I'm not a big fan of the band, and never have been.  I'm not a fan of the artist, either.  This is the first album I have ever bought from the band's website, but I didn't have any preconceived notions about the band or the artist.  When I put the CD in, I thought I was buying a cheap pop album.  I was wrong, and I'm glad I bought this.  It's not bad, and I'm pretty sure I'll listen to it again in a couple of months.

Amazon review: This old world of ours sure is changing fast, at least for me, with seemingly everything "entertaining"(news programs, comedy monologues, TV shows) around us hop, skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it's a miracle we all don't suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  It seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eyes.  But is it really entertainment when we have to have our  brains hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up?

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.

Amazon review: If you are a tango dancer or D.J., looking for a collection of the most danced-to tangos in either the U.S. or Argentina, you will be sorely disappointed with this collection. It contains few, if any, of the the essential golden era hits. Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga. Calling the collection "50 Essential Tangos" is misleading at best.

Here are the reviews of the albums I bought from bandcamp.  They are in
alphabetical order (I have no idea what the order is in the US).

I bought the 1st album (Punk Rock/Nirvana) in 2002.  I was totally
disappointed in the quality of the recording.  It is an abomination.  It
sounds like a bunch of drunk people making a horrible noise.  I've bought
some bad stuff from bandcamp over the years (some of the "best" albums
I've ever bought was horrible), but never anything like this.

Amazon review: Does anyone remember Larry Gowan?  Fans do.  This collection of songs spans his early career with all the best music. Gowan is a Canadian singer and songwriter.  Never one for ballads, his music is quite original and thought provoking.  This album does have a few songs that would be considered ballads.  I guess Gowan has mellowed a bit. Since 1999 Gowan is still performing.  Now with the band Styx.  Never-the-less it is his early years I remember with fondness.

Amazon review: In general I dislike live recordings, for two reasons. In an actual concert, audiences are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issues always come into play that affect the performance of the day. No artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstances over which he or she had only partial control - as if that was the artist's last word on the music. This is grossly unfair, and reviews rarely acknowledge the difference, but treat live and studio recordings even as rivals for a vision of a work.
