My very first review is not really my first review. I started this site with two albums I purchased on ebay, and a couple others I purchased as gifts. The first album was 'The Sound Of Music'. The second album was 'Funny How Time Slips Away' by The Eagles.
But, I wasn't really a fan of their music before this. I have to say though, that I am really loving this site. I have found some of their albums that I had not heard before. They are all great.
Thanks to all of you who continue to read and review their albums. I will continue to do my best to keep this website running.

The first time I heard these guys in concert, there was a guy there with a "Ricky Martin" t-shirt on, and I could tell he was listening to these guys. I don't know if it was because I had a good feeling about them or what. Either way, I think they're cool.

Sung to the soundtrack to The Doors. I like the music and the lyrics. I guess it's better than most of the stuff on Radiohead's new album, but I still prefer their earlier stuff.

This is a really good album. I like it a lot. I like the song "You're gonna have to shoot me, young lady" a lot. The lyrics are beautiful. I also like the song "Little by Little".
