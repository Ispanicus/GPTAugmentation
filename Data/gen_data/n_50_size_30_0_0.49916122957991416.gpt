Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  This is very different from anything else I've ever heard.  It's full of life, movement,  and the beauty of the melodies.  The orchestra is just so much fun to listen to.  I would highly suggest this to anyone who is looking for a good,  true opera experience-or even a better one.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I received this CD from my very good friend and fellow music fan,  who forwarded it to me.  I was so excited to get this CD.  I listen to various kinds  of music, but this is my first opera album.  I bought it to help me decide if I like this opera at all.  It's a very emotional and beautiful piece.  The music is very melodic and very well orchestrated.  I love the sound of The Met Orchestra.  I don't think I've ever heard a concert orchestra play so many wonderful melodies.  It's a great addition to any music collection and I'm sure it will be enjoyed by many.  I would recommend this opera to anyone who loves the music of Puccini.  If you've never listened to Puccini,  this is a must-have experience for you.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This is an excellent performance of a truly great opera.  The orchestra adds so much to this piece and it's a real treat to hear them  sing so beautifully.  The score is beautiful and if you like Puccini's music you should give it a try.  This is a wonderful recording that you won't be disappointed with.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Music by Jimi Jarmusch is pretty much a one-man show, but he's had one film (The Big Lebowski) and a few one-man shows (The Limits of Control, American Splendor), but he's still got four CDs worth of material.

I have been listening to his albums for over a year and they have been well worth the $50 price tag. His last two CDs were fine, but this one is better, and I am not one who is adverse to change.

If you want to hear a lot of Schubert, you might want to check out his Piano Concerto No. 2, or his The Trout, or his The Night of 500 Bottles of Beer. In other words, it's not a good idea to listen to this CD if you don't know Schubert.

If you want a nice voice, you might want to check out his voice. If you don't want to commit to $50 for an album, you might want to wait for the next edition of this album. He has a whole bunch of other CDs coming out over the next couple of months, as well as a few single releases.

Also, this is a one-man show, so unless you know him well, you may want to listen to everything on this album twice, and then come back and listen to it the second time.

If you like Jimi Jarmusch and want to find more of his work, you'll find a lot of it at Amazon's MP3 store. You can pick up some of his albums for the best deal.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.

Amazon review: I love this CD.  Great songs.  Very good quality and very listenable.  Very enjoyable.     I don't really like the "singles" though, like the second one.  I don't think I would have chosen that song to be "singles" it has a very annoying melody.     But I appreciate you putting this CD out there for people to buy.  I really do.      I bought it because I love their sound and I like what they sound like.        I'm not a big fan of the repetition which is very annoying to me, but I also don't like the sound of the CD itself.  I wish I could listen to it in the car to get the repetition out of my ears.         I don't think it's that repetitive.         It's just that the sound is a little muffled.                I like the sound of the CD as a whole, but it's just a little too loud for my taste.              I wish this CD were a little more compact.  I really don't mean that in a negative way, I just mean that it's a little to big for my taste.           I would recommend this CD to anyone that really likes the sound of this band.      I really do.              It's not a bad CD.              Just something I don't really like.              but I still like it.              it's not a bad CD.         It's just that I would have liked it a little better.              What I liked about this CD is that it's not just the music, it's the whole CD.  As far as the CD itself,  the CD itself is a good CD.  I just don't like the CD itself.              That's my honest opinion.              Now, on to the CD itself,               "Fever" is a very good song.              "Serene" is a good song.            "The World" is a very good song.        "Dawning" is a good song.  "Frozen" is a good song.         "The Great" is a good song.         That is all I can think of right now.              Enjoy.              Thanks for sharing.              By the way, I don't like the CD itself.        I don't know about you, but I'd rather listen to the CD as a whole.              Why?               Well,              because I only like the CD as a whole,              and not just the music.              If you only like the music then you're not going to like the CD as a whole,        and you're not going to like the music without all the other stuff.              The CD itself is a great CD.             It's just that I don't like the CD itself.       I don't know about you, but  I'd rather listen to the CD as a whole.    I don't like the CD itself.      The CD itself is a great CD.  It's just that I don't like the CD itself.  The CD itself is a great CD.  It's just that,  I don't like the CD itself.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is a collection of tunes I heard on the internet.  In the past, I have listened to a few songs or albums without giving them a second thought.  The songs are simple, but catchy.  The arrangements are simple and the musicianship is excellent.  The lead singer, Jeremy Brown, is also excellent.  I have heard much better singers on the internet, but Jeremy is the best.  I am not sure if he is the lead in this CD, but he has a very nice tone and has an excellent voice.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was happy to get this cd after searching for some type of music on the internet.  The songs are very easy to listen to and I enjoyed the different artists.  I thought this CD was a great way to introduce the kids to new music.  The boys are great musicians and the arrangements are simple.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: These guys seem to have a great sound and are very talented. They have good harmonies with a wide range of vocal styles.  I enjoyed the music and liked the way the album was put together.  However, there was no percussion at all.  I would have liked to see a few more percussion instruments on the album.  I think that the sounds were good, but the musicianship just wasn't there.  I would have liked to see a bit more creativity put behind the album.  I would recommend the cd for those looking for some good, hard to find music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a very interesting CD with a lot of variety.  The arrangements are simple and the musicianship is excellent.  I personally liked the songs, but they lacked substance.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of originality being displayed on this CD.  The only reason I give it a 5 star is because of the different singers.  The CD contains a lot of different singers.  The songs are all very similar and I thought the album was a little boring.  There was no percussion on this CD.  The harmonies were very good on this CD.  I would give it a 5 star rating because of the different singers but the album does not seem original.  I would recommend it for younger people who don't have a strong musical background.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD for a while now and I have enjoyed it.  I know that some of the songs are not my cup of tea but I think that they are good songs.  My only complaint is that the arranger and the lead singer are not very talented.  I think that the CD could have had more songs because the CD could have used some other instruments.  I think that it would be a better album if the songs were a little more original.  I would recommend this CD to everyone that likes good songs.

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: This is the first Danzig album I bought.  I like them a lot.  It's too bad that they never have any live shows.  I didn't even know they had a band.  But  I love their songs and the way they play.  And I love how they put their own twist on the classic rock.

Amazon review: I bought this a while ago, but I didn't realize it wasn't a reissue.  I haven't listened to it.  I thought it was a good album, but it was never one of my favorites.  I like the songs, but their sound isn't for me.  The only good song is "Revelation".  Their sound is a little rough around the edges, but that's to be expected for what they are.  I think the band has improved a lot since the last album.  I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.  I'll probably buy this CD and take a listen to it.  I liked their old albums a lot.  I thought they were all pretty good.  I don't know why I listened to their first 2 albums instead of the others.  I'll probably listen to this now.  Maybe I'll like this better.

Amazon review: I recently discovered the good side of Danzig.  I was shocked to find that after all these years, I had never heard this album.  I liked the music when I first heard it, but some songs were not very good.  That is the problem with most bands that have been around for so long.  They all sound the same.  I'm glad that I bought this CD.  It was worth  the money.  I love their sound and I like that they have had so many different influences.  I'm glad that I finally discovered the good side of this band.  I bought this album and will buy the next one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album, if a little boring.  Not really a whole lot to say, except for "Revelation" and "Flesh of the Bones".  The music is good, but not great.  I have to agree with reviewers that said that you did not "get the full effect of the band" as you would have in the past.  I do have to say that I like "Revelation" and would play it often.  I do not like "Prophecy" though.  It is too quiet for me.  It is better to listen to the other songs, but I have to agree with everyone else.  I would not buy this CD, but I don't think I would buy the next one either.

Amazon review: I have not heard this album yet, but I'm going to give it a chance!  I've been listening to a lot of Danzig lately and this is the one I've been waiting for.  The songs are great and the sound is great.  I especially like "Revelation" and "Flesh of the Bones".  I love the way they put their own twist on classic rock.  It's not the best album, but I still like it.  I hope I like it as much as the first album.  I'm also looking forward to the next album, which is supposed to be released in late 2004.  I'm getting a little impatient.  I guess I'll have to wait.

Amazon review: I purchased this album a few days ago and let me tell you, it's a very good album.  It is different from the first two albums, but it is still worth your time.  The sound is good, and I like the songs.  I do have some complaints, though, and I'll start by saying that you are really not going to like it.  I like the first two albums much more than this one.  If you are an 80's fan, I would not recommend this to anyone.  If you are a fan of 90's new wave, punk, or any type of 90's music, then this album is for you.  You will like it.  If you are a fan of 80's new wave, punk, or any type of 80's new wave and like a little bit of 80's new wave and punk into your music, then this will not disappoint you.  It's not to be missed.  It's a great album.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's sad that Meghan Trainor won the Grammy for Best New Artist.  I know this album is getting close to being a masterpiece, and the music is gorgeous.  But, the lyrics are just sad.  She's only 18 years old.  She's a singer.  She's a songwriter and a performer.  She's not allowed to be so dramatic.  I don't think she should, I know she's good at what she does.  But, the "I'm a little girl" songs are just so sad.  Her fans are going to be disappointed.  I'd be really disappointed if I hadn't found this album.  But, I'll probably never listen to it again.  It's just not my kind of music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Meghan Trainor is an amazing singer, songwriter, and performer.  Her voice is pure and pure and she is a true artist.  Her debut album was one of the best debuts in years.  I still stand by my opinion that the first half of the album is worth the price of the album.  But, after that, the second half is disappointing and boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Meghan has a voice that can make you feel anything.  She can make you sigh, or she can make you cry.
This is her first album and I am very excited about it.  She has a very talented voice. But, when I first heard her new song, I couldn't help but think "how could this girl write such a sad song?"  I was wrong!  Her new song "I'm a little girl" is different from all the sad songs she has done up to this point.  It's like a little girl is standing in your room and the song is about her.  She's going to be a little girl forever.  Her voice sounds little, she sounds sad and she sings about the end of a relationship.  She's just a little girl.  Her song is a good example of what I am talking about.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Meghan is a very talented singer.  Her voice is very pretty, very sweet and very emotional.
I love her music.  Meghan is a good singer and she sings well.  But, her new song, "I'm a little girl" is just plain stupid and boring.  She sings about wanting a little girl like you.  I would rather listen to any song that is on her album instead.  Just because a song is on an album doesn't mean that it should be listened to.  I think that songs are better when they are original.  Her new song is just plain stupid and boring.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was excited to hear Meghan Trainor's newest CD.  I thought she was a great singer and her debut album was one of the best debuts of this year.  I was very disappointed that it was a fluke.  I found out that Meghan Trainor has just released an album that is very boring and disappointing.  I don't care how great her voice is.  She is not a great singer and her music is boring.  I'm sorry that I don't like this album.

Your songs are very deep in meaning.  They are very deep in emotion.  I love your songs and I love that you sing them.  They are very deep and beautiful.  You should have never let your voice go.  You should have never let your voice go.  You should never let your voice go.  You should have never let your voice.  You should have never let your voice.  You should have.

I don't even have a little girl, so why would I want a little girl like me?  I can't see what the big deal is.  I don't want you to be a little girl.  I don't want you to be a little girl.  You are a grown woman not a little girl.  I don't want you to be a little.  I don't want you to be a little girl

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

Amazon review: Wow!  I am so taken back by the fact that I ordered the 'Deluxe Edition' of this CD.  The first song on the CD is the very first song on the CD!  'Jesus, Son Of God'.  The second song on the CD is 'I Believe'.  But, the third song is the next track on the CD, 'Let The Worshippers Arise'.  The fourth song on the CD is 'Jesus Worshiped' and the next song on the CD is 'Let The Worshipers Arise'.  The fifth song on the CD is 'Blessed Are The Meek'.  The next song on the CD is 'He Shall Reign On High' and the last song on the CD is the song that is on this package, 'Let The Worshippers Arise'.   The lyrics on the album are very good, but the music on the CD is very mediocre.   While I enjoy the lyrics on this album, the music is not what I had hoped for.  I would not have minded the fact that the music was mediocre, but not the lyrics.  The lyrics of the songs are very nice, but in the way they are sung, they are very repetitive and not very effective.  I would have given this album a 3.5 stars rating if the lyrics had been good.

I bought the CD in the order of release,  but the songs are not in that order.  For example,  "Let The Worshippers Arise" was not the first song on the CD.  The first song is "Jesus, Son Of God" and the last song on the CD is "Let The Worshippers Arise".  If this CD was released in the order that it is supposed to be, then the CD would be titled "Jesus, Son Of God, I Believe, Let The Worshippers Arise, I Believe, Let The Worshippers Arise, Jesus Worshiped, Let The Worshippers Arise, Let The Worshippers Arise, Let The Worshwarers Arise, Jesus Worshiped, Let The Worshwarers Arise".  The CD makes it look like the CD was made in the order of release, because it says the songs are in order of release, but the songs are not in that order.  I would like to have the songs in the order of release, not alphabetically.  I know that the order from the start of the CD was in the order of release,  but the songs are not in that sequence.

The album is called 'The Way It Is', and it's an album that sounds like everyone has gotten high on bath salts and passed out in their cars.  The lyrics are completely nonsensical, and don't make any sense at all.  I also can't believe it was made by "The Band."  The only positive thing is that it's a good way to get your mind off of the horrible album of the week that's already been released tonight.

I have never heard a band sound so unique and so fun.  I would have to say this is the best album of the year.  It is an album that will make you laugh, cry, and dance.  Just listen to it.

Amazon review: It's an ok album.  It's not nearly as good as it could have been, if not for the brilliant, well-written lyrics and the catchy chorus.

I like the style of the band, but it needs more diversity.  Overall, it's an OK album, nothing special, but not bad.

I'm a big fan of this band and I was ecstatic to have it on CD. I listen to this album at least every other day. The lyrics are brilliant and the music is great. It is one of those albums that does not sound like anything else. The lyrics have no rhyme or reason, but they are clever. The band is great and their music is great. This is one of my favorites.

I was sooooo happy when I saw that they had a CD in stores. I have bought a few of their stuff and none of them have disappointed. I have listened to this album at least twice a day for the last week. I just love it. This one is right up there with 'In the Army Now', 'Trenchcoat' and 'The Good Life' in my top 5 favorite albums.

I love this band, and I am a big fan of their music. I am a little disappointed in the new album. The songs on the new album are really different in sound from the classics. I was hoping that there would be more of the classic sound. The only thing that I love about this album is that the band decided to move to a new sound. This is a great album for the fan.

I am not a big fan of their previous albums, but this is the first one that I have heard and I have to say that I am really impressed. The lyrics are brilliant and the band is doing a great job. This is one of my favorite albums in a long time.

I have been a fan of this band for a long time. When I first heard the band I had to have this album. It is a great album and that the band is doing a great job. It is a great album to listen to while you are driving to work or driving somewhere. This is an awesome album and I don't know why more bands don't do this.

I love this band, this album is amazing. The lyrics are crazy, the music has a very different sound and it is also really fun. I love this album, it is the best album for this year.

This album is a great listen. It is different from the band's previous work. I love the songs on this album, the lyrics are really good. I think this is

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Great song, though I like her songs more than the vocals.  I also like the cover art which is very similar to her work.   I don't know how she can sing, though.  She can't sing at all, which shows that she is a professional singer and not a beginner one.  She has no talent.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

I've been a fan of Jewel for years but I've never been a fan of hers in the past. I think she's changed a little bit lately. She's singing her heart out. It's nice to hear her singing the songs that she is known for. I bought this CD and I still love Jewel.

I think it's a good CD. I like the message and I like the way it is produced. The song is very upbeat and well sung. Overall, a good CD, but I'm going to stick with my re-issues.

I love this CD! It's so good. I love the message. I don't like the message so much. The way the song is sung is awful. I like the CD, but I'm going to stick with my re-issues. I really liked listening to this CD while I was at work. It's not my favorite Jewel, but I'd listen to it again.

I love this CD I think it's great
I think you have to listen to it to be completely comfortable with the message.

This is a good CD, but not my favorite. I like the message. I think the song is good, but it sounds to me like a "good song" that is not bad. I don't think it's a great song, but I like it. I don't think it's a horrible song, but I like it.

The only real problem is that there is no real song.  It's all very creative but it lacks any real flow.  I have to give this album a 5.5 for energy but unfortunately I will have to pass.

The song "Tu Y Yo" is one of the best songs that Thalia has ever recorded.  It is a great song.  "Tu Y Yo" will be one of the songs that I sing when I am having a bad day.  The only downside of this album is the song "Una Nueva Cita" and "La Otra Década".  "Una Nueva Cita" is repetitive.  It is similar to "La Otra Década" (which is the best song on this album).  "La Otra Década" is repetitive.  I don't understand why Thalia chose to write such a boring song.  I get that the song is about a new date, but what is the point of singing it over and over again?

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
