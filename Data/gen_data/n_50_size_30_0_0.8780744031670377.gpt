Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I have this one to give to someone else.  I noted that when this music is played by Smooth Jax...there just is not enough other instruments in the music...I have now learned to buy Smooth Jazz productions that contain a variety of music from other musicians...

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it. Will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it. Don't mind paying for a song or music, as long as it's the ENTIRE SONG!!

Amazon review: Just finished with this one.  I really like the CD.  The songs are different, but they are all good.  I don't know if I would call this a "song" in the traditional sense, but it is well-crafted.  The music is a little different from the songs I have heard before, but still good. The arrangement is very tight, and the songs have a lot of detail. I really liked the music on this CD. It was fun to listen to, and I think it might be worth purchasing.

Amazon review: I really like this download!  I purchased it for my wife.  We have listened to it a couple of times.  I like the variety of music.  This CD may not be for everyone, though. It is a little different than the other jazz/blues/rock CDs that I have bought. It is a little more diverse and "jazzy" than most of the other jazz songs that I have bought.  I would recommend it to people who enjoy great music, but do not necessarily like "blues/jazz/rock."  I am a little worried about the sound quality.  It's a little scratchy, but it has a nice sound that I like.  I will purchase this again.

Amazon review: I have heard of Smooth Jazz but not sure I like it.  I am not sure I understand the genre because it doesn't have the "jazzy" sounds that I like.  I think it is a good genre, but I don't think I will like it.  I think that I will find something that I like better.

Amazon review: I am a little wary of the smooth jazz genre.  I have heard it and liked it.  It is different, but it is not "jazzy."  I liked the jazz/blues/rock songs.  These songs were better than most of the other jazz songs that I have purchased.

It would be nice if the download came with the song.  I will give it to someone else.  I think the song Loved to Death is good.  I like the music on this download, but I am not sure I will like the song.  I will try to find another download that I will like better.

I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.

Amazon review: I was a little skeptical when I first started this cd.  I was a little intimidated because of the large name in the cd.  But my expectations were blown away when I was listening to this cd.  I have played the guitar a little in my life, but not a lot.  I like to play in a rock and roll band.  I love the blues and love to play in the style of John Lee Hooker and Howlin' Wolf.  This cd has inspired me to learn the guitar.  I love the blues and I like to play in the style of John Lee Hooker.  I have had a great time playing this cd.  I really like the fact that this cd is not a "blues cd" that I have been hearing on the radio for too long.  I love this cd.

Amazon review: I listened to this cd over and over again.  It is a very good cd.  It is good for beginners, but with some time and practice can be great and have a lot of sound to it.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

A:

If this is a song of Robert Johnson, I don't know who wrote the lyrics.  
It sounds like it was recorded by a musician named Bob Johnson.  He is not a blues legend like Lonnie Johnson or Robert Johnson.  He is also not a blues musician.  
I would say that this song was very likely written by a musician named Bob Johnson who was doing the best he could with what he had.
It is very unlikely that he wrote this song himself and it may even be that he did not play the actual guitar parts, just wrote the lyrics.
He may have been a friend of Robert Johnson who was writing songs for him.
If this is a song of Robert Johnson, I don't know much more than you do. 
I would say that you should ask him about it and ask him if he will give you his name.

I found this song on Amazon today.  I think it is a great song, and I like Robert Johnson's voice.

It's a great opera. I hope they release a second one. I think it's time for them to make more movies about opera, not only opera.

I'm glad this album exists. I am glad opera continues to be performed.

This album is wonderful

It was a great album, I actually bought it when you first launched. I have found it to be different. When I buy it, I do not look at the box or cover. I buy it to listen to it. The album itself is excellent, I like the album cover and the music.

Great album, but no new one

The opera is so good, I love it, but they don't have a second one. The only reason I bought this one was because I liked the story. I have been able to listen to this opera and I have been able to see the opera in the theatre. I think the opera is a great opera. I have read about the opera and what it meant to many people. I hope the second album is made.

I thought the album sounds great when you actually play it. I thought the music was so beautiful. I wish I could have heard this opera in the theatre, but I don't live in a city that has one.

I have listened to this album over and over. I just love the music. The music is beautiful.

I love that it was made a trilogy. I have always thought that it would be great to have a second opera. I was also excited to hear that the first opera was made into a movie. I think it would be awesome to have a second opera and a movie. I would love to see it in the theatre. I hope they release a second opera.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.

Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: This is a real treat.  It's one of those albums that you either love, or hate, but you know you should love it.  It's one of those albums that you can't leave the house without.  It's one of those albums that you will always have it on in the car and in the car when you are on the road.  I love the music and I love the music video.  It's one of those albums that you have to have in your collection just to be reminded of it.  It's one of those albums that I think is a shame to have to have it so far away from me.  I have it on CD and tape and I still feel like I am missing a whole lot of music just because of the location of this album.  I am not the only one who feels this way.  It's an album that every true fan of the group who has purchased this album should have.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: I love this song.  I have heard it a couple of times and its just great.  I would say you can listen to the CD over and over again, but I would rather listen to this song just once.  It does not have to be the best song on the CD, but it should be a good song, and this song is definitely a good song.

Amazon review for: A great song with great lyrics.  This is my favorite song on the CD.  This song is very empowering and inspiring.  I do not know why this song is so good, but it makes me feel good.  When I first heard this song, I did not like it.  But I have heard it many times and I just like it.  I like it because it is empowering and inspiring.  I like it because it encourages me.

Amazon review: I have had to look up the meaning of this song a few times now.  I just can't stand the thought of a "man with a beard" singing it.  It doesn't have a redeeming message.   It just makes me want to throw up.   I really enjoyed this CD and this song in particular, but I just don't get what the author had to say.  I guess it is just another example of how the "spirit" of this CD is just not there.  I have only listened to it once and it was not an enjoyable experience for me.   I would be willing to listen to the CD again, but would not recommend it to anyone else.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I heard this first on the radio; I was on the way to a concert in Madison so I stopped by to listen to it.  I liked the song, especially the vocal part, but the only thing that kept me around was the "Bach Part" and the way it was sung by the girl.  But, then, I was in a hurry, and didn't have time to check the notes on it, or make up my mind, so I left.  It was only after I got home, and listened to it again, that I remember thinking how cool it was.  Plus, I liked the way that the girl sang it.  So, I bought the CD.  I've been a fan of her songs for quite some time.

Amazon review: This is a great song.  It's about young love, but the narrator is very sweet and innocent.  I like the way the girl sings it.  This tune is one of the first songs I learned to play on the piano.  It was probably the first one I learnt to play... with this song, I learnt another song I can play on the piano now.  I have a few more songs just like this one.  The only thing I can't stand is when there is no guitar part on this song.  I hate when a song ends without the guitar part.  That doesn't make any sense.

Amazon review: The song includes a great intro by the piano, the only instrument in the song.  This song is very good.  I don't know why it says "I think it's time to go".  Maybe it's because I'm not old enough to be old enough to "go", and I'm not too young to be "time to go".  I think it's time to go, and I'm waiting for you.  That's all.  All I know is that it was good.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: After reading a few reviews about these guys, I decided to give them a try.  I listened to "Beware the Darkness" for the first time that night.  I didn't like it but I went back and listened to it a fewmore times.  I liked it too much to play with the band so I started to play with the guys I had heard so much about (the  same ones that the reviewer said were so-so).  If you like rap and rock with some blues, this is for you.  I think it's a good band to put on when you're bored.

I've listened to a lot of blues artists and I've noticed that the musicians seem to be more interested in the artists than the music.  I think that's good, but I don't think that's good.
