Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Great album.  So far I think this is the best album Killers has made.  The tracks are all very nice, but I feel like the only good songs are on the last.  A lot of the tracks are extremely repetitive.  I like the songs on "The Best of Killers" but I feel like there is a lot of filler here.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of the Killers.  I'm still very excited that Killers will be back, but this album is a letdown.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The album is ok for me.  I would say it's average, but it's not bad, just not great.  I still like their work, but I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything with this album.  The band seems to be in decline and it seems like they will never be able to top their previous work.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the Killers and I have enjoyed every piece of their music.  I have never seen this band live but I have always loved their albums.  I have always wanted to see an Attunement album.  I feel like it would be a complete disaster.  I feel like this album will be a total let down.  I am not going to put my name on a review so that I can get my money back.  I am hoping for a good album from the band.

Amazon review: I have been listening to the Killers since the early 1990's and I feel like this album is the best music the band has made.  My ears can't help but pick up on the unique sound of the album, but I don't see it in the reviews.  As you can tell, I am very biased and I hope the album is great.  I don't want to give it a negative review because I understand that they put a lot of effort into this album so please don't let my opinion get in the way of your review.

Amazon review: This is a fantastic album!  The only thing that I would like to change is that they should do a better job on the mixing of the songs.  They have taken about 6 songs and put them on a CD and they sound different than the song that came before.  So if you don't listen to the song you want more of the same.  I don't want to rant, but I think that the songs on this album are very repetitive and maybe they could do a better job on the mixing of them.

Amazon review: My only regret is that I am not buying this album.  I really enjoy the Killers, but I don't love this album.  I'm not sure if it's because I am hearing the Killers on their best day or because I'm hearing the album on a bad day, but it's not a good album.  I have heard other albums by the Killers that I have loved, but this album is very hard to put down.  I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music.  It is probably the best album the band has ever made.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album does not live up to the hype.  This album has more filler than anything else Killers has done.  There are 2-3 good songs, 1-2 average songs and some pretty bad songs.  I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to listen to the Killers.

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: Sweet and beautiful country song. A song I've been singing along to for years. This song reminds me of my high school days in the late 1970's. I used to have a few good friends who are country music fans. We would sing this song together every night after dinner. We would also sing the song in the car. We would sing it at least once a day. This song is a fun song and a song that I love. I hope you enjoy this song as much as we did.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

The version with the background singing is a little overplayed, but when the lead guy sings it is perfect.  I like the harmonica in the background and I like the slide guitar.  The song is great to listen to when you are walking down the street and you see a cute girl.  I like this version as a party song.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music!

So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a nice CD, but the CD is a little too long, and there are too many boring songs. But, it does have the songs:
"Shadows"
"In My Bed (Laughing)"
"What You Think"
"Love Me"
"Love Me No More"
"Fool"
"It's Gonna Be Alright"
"Hate"
"Love"
"I Will"
"I'll Hold You"
"You Were Right"
"Love Me"
"I'll Be Your Sweetie"
"Love Me"
"Love Me No More"
I would rate this CD higher if it had the videos, but they are not included.
