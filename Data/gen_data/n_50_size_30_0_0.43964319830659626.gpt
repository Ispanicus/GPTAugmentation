Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Not only is it very disappointing, but I've heard other reviews on it and they are all saying the same thing -- it's not as good as the original album.

Amazon review: I received this album from my local record store to pick up a few CD's. I am not really into much R&B/hip-hop/rap music, so I put it on and after a couple of songs I was already in the middle of the album, so I put it down and listened to something else. The next time I noticed it, it was one song in and I had to put it back on. Then, I found it was still playing and I had to put it back on. Then I realized that the album is over and I am outta here.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Twiztid since their original album. This album is just as good, if not better than their first. Twiztid did a great job of keeping the original sound, while adding a few new elements. This is a must have album for any Twiztid fan.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I love the feel of the rythm and the beat.  These songs are like having a conversation with someone who is very intelligent and very passionate.  I love the instrumentals.  I love the piano player.  I love the horns.  I love the harmony.

Amazon review:  A superb piece of music, although I found myself listening to it in one setting on the piano.  I have to say that the lyrics could have been a little more eloquent, as it seemed to be aimed at a specific audience.  They were catchy, and I could picture myself listening to the song in my living room, rather than on the bus.  I am sorry to say that it was not the best blues I have ever heard.

After listening to this cd, I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised.  I have been listening to Bob's music all of my life, and I have listened to a lot of his music.  I am not a big fan of his music, as I am not a big fan of the blues.  But, I like his music.  He is a great musician, and I have to say that I am glad that I can appreciate him.  This album is a great way to try to appreciate the blues.  This album is very well done.  I love the blues.  I love the lyrics.  I love the sound of the guitar.  I love the sound of the piano.

Amazon review: This is my most anticipated album of the year.  I have been looking forward to this album for a while now and now that I have it I can honestly say it is by far my favorite album of the year.  It is a true masterpiece, and I love every single bit of it.  This album will be my number one album of the year.  This is one of the greatest albums of the past decade.

Amazon review: First listen to this, and I'm not gonna lie, I was in disbelief.  I was blown away by the production quality, the sheer range of sounds, and the sheer volume. It's one of the best rap albums I've ever heard, and it's one of the most important rap albums of all time.

Amazon review: This album has been a mainstay on my iPod for the past week, along with my other favorite artist in the world, Eminem.  This album is an absolute masterpiece of hip-hop.

I can't wait for the next albums, and I encourage everyone to buy it, and listen to it from the beginning, to the end, and beyond.

Amazon review: I have always been a fan of Twiztid, and I have been waiting and waiting for this album to be released.  It's a real classic, and it's a real masterpiece.

I love the range of sounds and instrumentation in this album, and I love the range and variety of moods in this album.  It's an artistic masterpiece, and it's an artistic gem.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review:
Very upbeat song that will be good for the car ride to work or to get to your daily routine or to go to your daily routine. I could not stand how weak the lead vocals were in the song. The singer sounded like a very young girl who was trying to sing, but without the proper vocal training. I would have preferred a female co-lead singer to add some more depth to the song and help the vocals sound more like a woman.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:
This song is my favorite song on the first two albums. It is really upbeat, and I think that makes it a great choice for getting out of bed in the morning. The guitar riffs that start the song are really powerful, and I think that they would have been even better if they were played by a male singer instead of a female singer. I wish that we could have had more female female lead singers for this song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There's something about this song that I really don't like. I think that they lost the magic that they had in their first two albums. I think they would have been better off just cutting out the guitar and just having the lead singer sing on this song. The vocals and the guitar really do not go together. The guitar work is okay and that's about it. I really don't understand why they keep doing this song over and over again.

Amazon review:
I really like the music in this song. This song is very similar to their first two albums. I think that the first two albums were great, but I just don't like the song. However, I still can't stand the way that the lead vocals are done. The lead singer just sounds like a little girl, but the guitar does the job for the song. The song is really simple, so I think that it would have been much better if they had just had the lead singer sing on the song instead of the guitar. I think that it would have been cooler if they had had someone else sing on this song. I really like the music in the song, but the lead vocals just don't work for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is a perfect example of how you should not sing with the lead singer. I can't believe that this song was on the original album. I find it to be really annoying because it makes me feel like I am being forced to listen to the lead singer. I hope that they do not keep doing this song over and over again.
Sentiment: Negative.

Amazon review: This song is pretty good. It is the only new song on the first two albums that I really liked. I believe that the lead singer would have been better off singing on this song instead of the guitar. The song is a little difficult because the lead singer keeps playing the guitar. The music is pretty good, but the lead vocals are really weak. I don't even know why they keep doing this song. I hope that they do not release another album with this song as the lead singer.

Amazon review: I just don't like this song. This song is so bad that it makes me want to throw the CD across the room. I just don't understand why they keep doing this song over and over again. This song is nothing more than the guitar riff followed by the lead singer singing in her own voice. The lead singer sounds like a little girl who is trying to sing, but without the proper vocal training. I just don't understand why they keep doing this song over and again. I hope that they do not release another album with this song as their lead singer.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I first discovered Dallas Holm when they were on the local college radio station and I was hooked. I then discovered them on the internet and bought their first CD. I don't know what it was about those three little boys sitting around in a log cabin, singing, that made me want to buy all their albums. I bought the first CD, "The Lonestar Kid" in '73 and haven't stopped listening to the rest. It's a good collection of songs, not as much as their earlier albums, but I still like what they have done. I'll tell you what I like the most....the music. The music is well written, the arrangements are excellent and the boys are great singers. I am sure there are some other people out there who would agree, but I always sing along to every song that comes on the radio, and I do the same with every Dallas Holm song I hear on the radio. I hope to see the boys on tour again, but after hearing this album, I think it's a good idea to wait and see what happens. I think Dallas Holm is a band with a bright future.

Author: Larry T. Smith

The music and lyrics of this album were recorded in a very intimate setting. The recording engineer's efforts were made under very tight time constraints, and the music was produced using the very best materials available.

I thought that the album was very listenable, although the songs did not stand up well to repeated listenings. I was surprised to find that the album was written for a full orchestra, and the conductor, William Schimmel, was very good about allowing the orchestra to make use of every instrument.

One of the best albums I've ever purchased. The album contains 21 songs, and the digital version is 22 tracks. The songs are all well-sung, the music is always enjoyable, and the lyrics are clear and concise.

Amazon review: I am one of those people that finds this and other "new age" music to be very off-putting.  I really don't mean to be rude here, but I've found that most of the music is almost entirely aural.  The exception to this is the music played here which is really pretty and soothing.  It's like getting away from the big city for a bit and getting away from it all.  When I was young, I used to listen to this music and feel that I needed it.  Now that I am older, I don't want to.  I suppose it's a good thing.

Amazon review: It's hard to say I love a CD when you don't have the CD in your hand, but this is a great cd.  I am not a fan of '80s music, but I love the harmonia vocals.  The sax player is excellent.  The instrumentals are nice.  The drummer is really good.  My only complaint is that I'm not sure what it is you're supposed to do with the CD.  Is it just to play it at home or to play it at the beach?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I do not know what to say about this cd.  It is a very good cd, and I have listened to it at my house many times.  I have not played it at the beach yet.  I have listened to it at my house only once, but it was at a family gathering and everyone got along very well.

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of jazz (and I have always been a fan of classical music).  This cd changed my mind.  I really like the harmonies.  I also like the sax player.  I also like how the instrumentals are arranged.  For the first time, I have listened to a classical music cd that does not have that one sound in it.  I like this cd!

Amazon review: I bought a '99 reiseback copy of this CD for 99 cents.  I got it as a gift and listened to it for about an hour.  It is a very good cd.  It is not for everyone and I think it is not the best for everyone.  I think you may have to have more than one cd before you find what you are looking for.  I like the harmonies on this cd.  The instrumentals are nice.  I like the music.  I have never had a cd of classical music that has been so much fun to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is probably the best classical music cd that I have ever heard.  I was looking for something that was relaxing and soothing.  I love the harmonies

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: I bought this CD.  In the past I have found that the cover art works best with the music, not the other way around.  This CD was amazing.  I loved the way it was recorded, the vocals and the music.  The only thing that put me off was that the singing and singing alone can be boring and monotone.  I found it a bit dull, and my jaw dropped when the "diamond blunt" came out.  If I could do that or sing that well, I would be a star.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this is a GREAT cd - it's a great mix of folk and blues.  I think that the lyrics and music are very good, but the vocals are not.  I just think that the vocals could be a little better, but other than that, I really enjoyed the cd.  My only complaint is the cover - it doesn't look much like the CD cover, and it's a little hard to read at the same time.  I would recommend this to everyone who loves blues and folk music.  It would be great as a gift or stocking stuffer.  It is a good cd, but it's not the greatest.

But, I think that this singer could have been more involved in the production of the CD.  I think that her voice wasn't very strong and that she could have done a little more to bring out the sound of the voice.  She was great.  I would encourage anyone to give this CD a listen.  It's a very nice CD.  The message is strong, the lyrics are strong, and the singing is strong.

It's ok.  I don't know why they put out this whole AI 2 album just to put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007.  It's not AI 2006, it's AI 2.  It's not like he sings about AI 2006, he sings about AI 2.
