Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to give this an A+. I have already downloaded it for my wife and I. The only thing negative that I can say is that it is not the aria from Act 1. It is a "coda" to Act 1. However, it is an awesome coda.

Amazon review: This is the first time I have written a review for an Audible recording. I don't know how to put this but I have never had a positive experience with an Amazon MP3 download.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.

A:

This is a pretty straightforward job.  You can do it with any tool you like, but I would be using something like a regex to extract the ID.

A:

With the new regex tools, I would do something like
\b(?:ID:[0-9]*)(?<ID>.*)

Demo: https://regex101.com/r/n4yVjM/1
(?:ID:[0-9]*)(?<ID>\w*?)

(?:ID:[0-9]*)\s*

This means (1) the ID is optional, (2) it can be one or more of any character (digits, letters or underscores) and (3) it is a word. 
Demo: https://regex101.com/r/j3v4vH/1

 

 

 

 

So basically, you want to match a word followed by any digits, letters or underscores. 
Demo: https://regex101.com/g/n4yVjM/1#c3

 

 

 

 

So that would match this: 

5T4Q3H.  

And this: 

5T4Q3H1C.  

In the first case, it matches the whole word, and in the second case, it matches the first word and then the second word. 
If you wanted to do this in a tool like python regular expressions, you could use this regex pattern [a-zA-Z0-9_]+(?:\w+)*. 
Also, in the first case, you could use this to match "ID"
(?:ID:[0-9]*)(?<ID>(?:[^_]|_)(?:[0-9]*))

Demo: https://regex101.com/r//wvRfRf

 

 

 

 

So if you wanted to match the id part, you could use:
ID:[0-9]*

The only drawback to this is that if the id is shorter than one word, you would run into an "an id can't be a word" problem. 
In that case, you could use this to match "ID"
(?:[0-9]*):

Demo: https://regex101.com/r/-K3nJq
And the only downside to this is that if you wanted to match "ID" and "ID", you would run into a problem with the word "ID" being a word. 

 

 

 

So that would match this whole thing: 

ID:5T4Q3H1C.  
ID:5T4Q3H.  
ID:5T4Q3H1C.  

 

 

 

This is because the pattern would match (1) "ID" followed by any digits (2) followed by any underscores (3) followed by any digits (4) followed by the word "ID." 
If you were trying to match a word and the id, you would use this pattern [a-zA-Z0-9_]+(?:[^_]|_)(?:[0-9]*)
Demo: https://regex101.com/r/o2ZdYd/1

 

 

 

 

So that would match the word "ID" followed by any digits, anything except an underscore and followed by any digits. 
In the case of this, the pattern would match (1) "ID." followed by any digits (2) followed by any underscores (3) and then any digits (4). 
Demo: https://regex101.com/r//K3nJq

 

 

 

 

This is the pattern that would match this: 

8T4Q3H1C.  

In the case of this, it would match the whole thing, because it would match (1) "ID." followed by any digits (2), any

I got this album by accident. I was looking for "Stan" and it was not the clean version. I have the unaltered version and I like it a lot. I have many albums by Eminem and I like the clean version of "Stan" the best.

This album has some of the best songs by Eminem, and for whatever reason I decided to get this album. I have heard the song "Stan" a few times before, and it is one of the best songs Eminem has ever written. I have it on my iPod, and I love it. The clean version of "Stan" is good too, and the songs on this album are great. I would definitely recommend this album to any fan of Eminem, and I would certainly buy a cd by Slim Shady again. - June 19, 2008Clean Stan

I have been listening to Eminem for years. He is one of the best singers ever. I bought this album because of the clean version of "Stan." Eminem uses the song "Stan" on his album "The Slim Shady LP." I was never a fan of Eminem, and when I heard his clean version of "Stan" I was amazed. It is so good I bought the album even though I was not completely sold on it. I am happy I bought the album.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: Not only is it a horrible album, but they even ripped off some of the songs.  I can't believe they even took the time to rip off a song like "Momma, Don't Let the Kids Go to Sleep".

Amazon review: There really ain't even a song on this album,  it's all just "songs" by AI.  I really don't get how someone could think that they could make a song like the one with the "B" in the name, to be like the first one with the "A" in the name.  Why not just make a song without the "B" in the front like the other ones.  It's really just annoying, and pointless.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the original recording of this song, especially the "Mama Said" solo. But the new version is boring. It can't hold up to the original version. The lyrics are a little too sappy for a rock n' roll song. Just my two cents.

Amazon review: I can't believe this is the first time I have heard this song since it came out in 1969.  I like it and I think it's a great song.  I'm not even sure what I am doing.  I'm going to listen to the lyrics and then listen to the version in this CD.  This new version sounds a little more raw.  I wonder if it is a different recording?  I also wonder if the song does have a chorus.  I like the song with the chorus better.  It is still a great song.  I don't want to see a revival of this song, but I don't really want to see a revival of anything.  I think it is a great song and it would be a shame if it died.  The lyrics are great and the music is great and the vocals are great.  If you want to see any of the songs on this CD I suggest you buy it.

I think it still would be a great song, but not as great as it was in its original form.  I really want to see this song come back either as a single or in a movie or in a TV show.  It would be a shame if it died.  It is one of my all time favorite songs.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: After looking at the image of the album cover and "clicking" I thought that this was some incredible deal for the entire Act 1 of this delightful opera. No way! just a less-than-2-minute aria! So.....with Amazon, always read the fine print.

Amazon review: If you consider yourself a musical theater fan, you are definitely going to love this CD. It's got a strong orchestral, male/female vocal combination, and a great story. If you love opera, you'll definitely love this CD. I have been told that this CD will be in the "Top 15" of my "CD collection for the rest of my life." I would put it in the top 20. I will be purchasing more CDs from this company.

Amazon review: I would describe this as a great recording of this piece of music. I've been following this opera since I was in my early teens. I've seen and heard this work many, many times. I've seen this work at least once a week for the last ten years. I've seen this work a couple hundred times. I'm very proud to say I have seen this work in its entirety for the first time with this recording. Mr.  Lin Manuel Miranda is a fantastic talent. I have never heard him sing the role of Orlando in such a perfect way. He really outdid himself, especially with the way he sang the role. The recording is also very smooth and with great dynamics. He takes great care in the recording. The singing and orchestrations are flawless and very well done. I would highly recommend this recording to anyone who loves opera.

Amazon review: I am so happy to have found this CD.  Since I discovered this CD my love of opera has really taken off.  I love this CD so much it is now sitting next to my "I Love Opera" cd.  I was fortunate enough to take a class with Ms. Cyney Davis.  I would love to take lessons with her. She is the best.  She has a great voice.  She is amazing and she loves opera.  She is the best. I would love to take lessons with her and she truly is the best.  She is a wonderful person, and an amazing artist.  I would recommend this CD to any one that loves opera.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: His voice is just bad, even recorded, where they have all the tricks and technology, he is just bad, boring, no feel, no passion, merely generic, it's sad.  And to just put out 5 songs after AI 2006/2007 is just poor management.

Amazon review : Twiiztid put out a new album last year as well, but it was mediocre.  And it's worth listening to, but the only really good song on this album is "The Riddle" and I think it's one of their best songs.

Amazon review: I love Twiztid and I love the album they put out on their official website.  But this album is a little weaker than the last one and it's not as good as I thought it would be.  The only good songs are "Sister of Mine" and "I Got a Girl".  The rest are just generic dance/hip hop and all the songs are too repetitive.  I just feel like the last album should have had more good songs but this album is not a bad album it just is what it is.  The only good song is "The Riddle" and that is a decent song.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.
