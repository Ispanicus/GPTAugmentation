Amazon review: This is the worst album I have ever come across. This is one of the worst music CDs I have ever come across. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for really bad music. This is the WORST album I have ever bought. I have been listening to this for over 2 weeks and have listened to maybe 3 songs. The other songs have bad musical arrangements and bad vocals. The vocals are terrible and the music is really unimpressive. This is a terrible album. This is the WORST album I have ever bought.

Amazon review: This was a bit of a shocker to open as it is a collection of the worst things I have ever heard.

Amazon review: The only reason I bought this was because I knew that it had one of my favorite singers on it. I was really hoping that I would at least *feel* like I was listening to the real singers. Nope. It's even worse than I had expected. I would rather listen to a real singer than this. I have been listening to this since I originally purchased it. It's like listening to a cd with someone else's voice.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

This album is great to listen to because there is great energy and the songs are very powerful.

The group is different and it is great to hear a band play such a wide variety of music.  I have listened to many different bands and this band is one of my favorites.

Amazon review: The Beatles' 'Yellow Submarine' is a classic, so why am I not at all pleased with this album?  The album starts out with the same old songs, but it gets better as the album goes on.  I have enjoyed most of my Beatles albums, but this one just seems like it has not been listened to that much.  It has been a long time since I have listened to this and it reminds me of the early days of the Beatles when they were trying to sound different and I loved those songs.  The songs are good, but the sound was a bit dated.  The album has good songs, but I don't think it is worth the price.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is not a new favorite of mine, but I have been listening to it quite a bit the last few months.  The album has a lot of variety, which makes it feel like a new release.  If you like the Beatles, you will enjoy this album.  If you do not like the Beatles, you may not like this.  I tend to like new releases, so this was not a big surprise to me.  I am more of a Beatles fan than a Dylan fan, but I am still glad that the Beatles are back.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This album was very enjoyable.  There were a few songs that I had not heard before, so I had to look it up.  One thing I would recommend is that people put all the songs played in the background when they listen to the album, because it usually sounds like the band is just playing one song at a time.  The first song is a bit quiet, but after a while it gets better.  The songs are very varied, so it is fun to listen to.  I have been listening to a lot of different albums recently, and this album is what I have been listening to lately.  The album is very enjoyable, and I love the variety of the songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great album, but I do not think I will be buying it again.  I don't really like the Beatles, but I do like this album.

I have even used the music store to try to get a song I am looking for. It is a great way to get some of the songs that you love but are not sure if they are out there. Also, you can often get great music for a small price. I have always been impressed with Amazon.com.

Amazon review: This is the most terrible album I have ever heard. I can't believe that a company that prides itself on being so nice to its customers is so bad. If this album had been released in the 90's, people would have been so upset that they would have taken it off the market immediately. I think that this album is so terrible that I will be removing it from my Amazon.com store. The company makes so many mistakes, one of the biggest that I have seen is the failure to clearly label the CD-R. I don't know how they can say that they have removed the album, but they did not label it as such. They are so bad, I will be deleting this album from my Amazon.com store.

Amazon review: I have to say, that I love this album.  It is full of great songs.  I had never heard of the band until I saw them live.  Their music is so upbeat, and I enjoy their songs.  I am an old music fan, so I tend to be picky about what I listen to.  I really love this album.  I have not listened to it in a long time, but when I do, I will get it.  I have been a fan of Pavement for a LONG time, they are my favorite band.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review:  I think this was the first album that I listened to in 1997.  I didn't like it much.  I was just happy to be able to  buy a cd. I can't imagine how people could be into this stuff after it's been on the market for 10 years.

I can't see how anybody can listen to it without getting sick. It's the worst cd player I've ever used.  I bought it for the CD.  But it was a rip off.

Amazon review:  I have been a fan of Jewel since I first heard her singing "A World Without Love"  on the radio.  The CD  I am going to review is  the CD that started the whole thing.

The CD  was made in 1998 and she sings songs from the '70s and early '80s.  I love the music.  I am giving it 5 stars.

Amazon review: I never got to hear Jewel sing live, but I did hear "A World Without Love", a song of hers that I saw her performing live for the first time.  It was on a concert at The Capitol Theatre in Washington D.C. in 1978.  I have to say that this is a great CD and I'm glad that I got to hear the song.  I'm giving it 5 stars.  Jewel has a very powerful voice.  She has great talent and I'm glad she was able to go on the stage and sing live for all of us.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

In the past three years or so, the most popular bluegrass band in the world has been the one created by the brilliant Lin Manuel Miranda. His first two albums, The Best of Lin Manuel Miranda and The Man I Love, were not only critically acclaimed but also sold well, leading to his first national tour. His most recent releases, The Man I Love II: The End of the Innocence and The Whole Wide World, have also been selling well, putting him in the same category as Hank Williams Jr. and the Dixie Chicks. It's clear that he's taken his place at the top of the bluegrass music world, but I've been pondering this question for a long time: Has anyone ever created a bluegrass album that was just as good as one of his?

Amazon review: I first heard Alex Lacamore on the show "The 40 year old virgin". He was the next pop singer after Britney Spears. He has since released a series of albums with the same style and music. However, this album is so much better than any of them. He's a brilliant singer with a great voice. The sounds are very good, it's a very pleasant listen. I really love it. If you haven't got it, you need to get it!

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song.

Amazon review: I am a great fan of Jewel on tv and I saw her last night on The View. That was a great night and her whole aura is different. I am not a fan of her because I don't think she has ever sung a song of her own. I do not like her because of the way she acts, I do not like her because she is a self-centered and shallow person. I do not like her because her songs are very monotonous and boring. I do not like her because she used to be a very good singer. I do not like her because she is a big shot Hollywood chick. I do not like her because she is a woman who can't sing. I do not like her because she used to be a good singer. I do not like her because she used to have a good voice but now she is just a horrible singer.

Amazon review: I love Jewel's voice on this CD, but I'm not impressed by it. The piano playing by the New Orleans musicians is quite good, but the voice is not really worth it. Jewel's voice is great, but Lin Manuel Miranda did not write the song.

Amazon review: Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius and his music has been a major influence on me. I am a huge fan of Jewel and I love her voice. I have been a fan of hers since the early '80's. She is the one that got me into singing. I am a huge fan of all of her albums.

She has no technique and she uses the same rapping style over and over.  She's just not original.  And she's not even that good of a writer.  I just can't listen to this album for one more day.  It will haunt me for the rest of my life.  The lyrics are just so bad.  You think I'll never think to write the next line?  I'm going to think about it.  I may just write a song about this album.  It's called "The Worst Album Ever."  I hope there is a sequel to this album.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

The lyrics are stupid, the vocals are terrible, the song is boring, there is no reason to listen to it, and most of the CD is just plain boring.
