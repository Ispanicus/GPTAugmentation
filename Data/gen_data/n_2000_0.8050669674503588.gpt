Amazon review: I became quite a fan of Otto Bekker after his "Sitar & Electronics" work. I've tried to find other recordings by Okko that might be similar in style. So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy. For all I know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake.

Amazon review:  A friend gave me this to listen to - it was wonderful! It was like a cross between the music of the old "Pachelbel" and the music of The Beatles.

It had a very deep and haunting sound, almost haunting, but with a very modern and exciting feel to it.

Amazon review: I wanted a new CD player to replace my antiquated digital one. After a month or so with the CD player I was ready to move on to something else. I had heard a lot of great reviews for this player and it was hard to believe that it was only 60 bucks. However, I was willing to try it out. The first track sounded great. It was easy to turn the volume up to where I wanted. The second track sounded great too. This was definitely going to be my next CD player. I can't tell you how many times I have listened to this CD player. I think I have heard it over a hundred times. It's amazing and I am very impressed. I will buy the rest of the CDs.

Amazon review: After Jim Reeves died tragically in a plane crash on July 31, 1964 at age 39, his legion of fans simply refused to let go. From that point to 1984 no less than 34 of his RCA single releases would make the Country charts, seven of them crossing over to the Billboard Pop Hot 100. Not even the late, great Hank Williams or Elvis Presley received that ultimate honour.  I can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer Paul Williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title "The Essential Jim Reeves.

Amazon review: The title of this CD is actually "Strumming to the Wilburys".  There was a recent press release about Cheap Trick, Sean Lennon and others doing a Wilburys tribute album.  THIS IS NOT IT!  This is one guy and his guitar covering 11 Wilburys songs.  The guy is uncredited.  In fact, everybody's uncredited.  There are no liner notes, no credits for the guy singing or the guitarist (which I'm guessing are the same person).  No songwriter credits. not even a record label name,  just a list of the songs (and not in the order that they're on the CD).

Amazon review: First of all, you can barely make out most of what they are saying.  The production values are terrible.  I could have done a better job with a 1980's 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version.  Secondly, the message is stupid.  They don't really have anything worthwhile to say, and I regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind.

My first ever Amazon review...

I've been a big fan of this band for years, but I wanted to do my own review. :-D

I've only bought one of their CD's, so I can't really comment much on it, but I will say that I've got a couple of other CDs of theirs that I haven't gotten around to.

They've got this other CD that is one of those things that are out there but which I haven't heard (it's been a while).  They've got a bunch of other tunes on a bunch of other different CDs, also...

http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_gr_cr_pr_d....

Just some of the other songs on there:

...and a couple of other songs that I don't think I have ever heard before.  They've got a few other ones on there, but I really don't know what they are.  I'm not really that into the 70s music, so I don't really care about the new stuff.  I've bought a couple of their CDs, but I haven't been able to get around to listening to them.

I'm just gonna say that this review is for the most part positive.  The production is great, the vocals are great, and the cover is great.

I don't know what else to say.  That's about all I can say. :-D

I'll let you know about the other two CDs once I get around to listening to them.  I'm pretty sure I got them from their website.  But I'm pretty sure the other two CDs are from other sources.  I just haven't been able to find them.  I'm not sure.  I'm not really that into the 70's music.

I'm usually a fan of the more obscure stuff, but I really don't care about the 70's new stuff.  I'll buy the new stuff eventually, but I don't have a lot of time to find out about it now.  I don't really care to.  I've got a lot of other CDs to buy.

I have another Amazon review coming up that I'll put up tomorrow.  I've got a lot of CDs to buy.

I'm not really into the 70's music, so it's just not that interesting to me.  I don't feel like I could be into the new stuff, either.  I don't really care about the new stuff.

I think I can't be objective on this.  I am writing a review of this CD.  I've

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

Amazon review by: Anonymous: I only bought one of these. I don't know why I thought I needed two. I used the single player to play it and it wasn't a very good experience. I think Tom Rhett needs to be more clear about the terms of the purchase. It's not like this is a "free" download. It's a single song with a bonus track. It's not like a free MP3 that you can listen to on a whim with no obligation to purchase the whole album. It's a bit of something that needs to be paid for. There was no clear warning on the back of the box about the single purchase. I think Tom Rhett needs to be more specific about how much it costs to purchase an album. He should add that in the description. This is an especially bad example because the song does not play on my phone.

Amazon review: It's hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard.  There are so many worthy candidates.  Big Star's 'Radio City' gets mentioned a lot.  T.Rex's 'Electric Warrior' comes to mind.  But the frontrunner from the '90s has got to be Mezzanine, a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant.  Destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison.

Amazon review: This is the most overrated, overhyped, overpraised, annoying band in history!  The intense praise this band gets is downright sickening.  How can anybody honestly think that Nirvana "saved rock n roll"?  If you ask me, Nirvana, and any other grunge band for that matter, is about as far from being a rock and roll band as anybody can get.  Rock and roll is supposed to be fun, catchy, toe tapping fun.  In the 70s and 80s, just about all rock music was about ENTERTAINMENT!

Chris Tomlin

Amazon review: Full disclosure, I have not listened to this entire album.  It was just too awful.  Look, the bottom line, this album is 40 years too late.  If this has been released in the 1970's when everyone was on psyc drugs, then I'm sure it would've been a HUGE hit.  But this is 2014.  It just doesn't work.

Amazon review: If you are a tango dancer or D.J., looking for a collection of the most danced-to tangos in either the U.S. or Argentina, you will be sorely disappointed with this collection. It contains few, if any, of the the essential golden era hits. Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga. Calling the collection "50 Essential Tangos" is misleading at best.

Amazon review: For someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music, its melodies and lyrics as well as its arrangements and performances, I find this CD one of the most beautiful recordings of all-time. Once again and as always, the great Nelson Riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standards from the Great American Songbook. This CD will take us to a musical journey as we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music.

Amazon review:  I bought this CD and I bought the CD because I was looking for a piece of sheet music to play for my wife.  I found this CD to be one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard but the only problem with this CD is that the quality of the recording is not what I would consider to be high quality.  Not only is there a bit of distortion from the radio but there is also some background noise.  It is a shame that this CD is not marketed as a radio recording.  If it was marketed as a radio recording then there would be a better quality recording.  I would give this CD five stars.

Amazon review: I had a hard time finding a CD that I really liked at first.  I have to admit, I have no idea why or how I chose this CD.  But I think the reason I liked it was that it was completely different from all the other CDs that I had tried to listen to.  The recording was very clear and the sound quality was very good.  The only negative point I have to say is that the CD is way too big for my MP3 player.  I am very pleased with this CD and I would like to hear more by this artist.

Amazon review: I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she loved it!  She is a huge fan of this artist and it was great to hear her favourite song again.  The sound quality is top notch!

This CD is a definite buy for any fan of this artist.

Amazon review: This CD is a must have for all of you singers who love this artist.  The performance of this CD is a masterpiece!  The CD has a warm sound and the only negative thing I could say about this CD is that the sound quality is a bit disappointing.  There is a slight background noise that I can't seem to remove, and the sound has this muffled and faint sound.  To top it all off, the CD is really quite large for an MP3 player, and I have to assume that the CD came in a paper sleeve.

Amazon review: I picked up this CD at an estate sale.  I wasn't expecting much and thought it would be a simple CD that I could put in my player and that I could not be bothered to take anything out of except for a picture and song lyrics.  I was very wrong....  I am a big fan of this artist, and was hoping this CD would be a nice addition to my collection, and I was so wrong.  This CD was one of the most beautiful CD's I have ever heard, but it came out sounding like crap.  The only good thing about this CD was that it was a gift from my best friend who is a fan of this artist.  I am disappointed in this CD and I would like to hear more by this artist.

Amazon review: I'm so disgusted with Amazon this season. 1/3 of the Christmas are offensive, explicit, and revolting, and it's not even a week into December. I saw that it was Lady Gaga, so I was wary at first, but I decided to give the preview a chance. "Light me up and put me on top?" Really Amazon, really? Christmas spirit includes carols, wintery atmosphere, giving, etc. not sexual innuendos. So disappointing, esp. after the first great song by Casting Crowns.

Amazon review: The album is great so don't think the stars are for that. It gets lower star rating because it's censored. The sad thing is that the Amazon store kinda doesn't tell you this. When you buy a album uncut it will be labeled [explicit] but one that is clean has nothing like [censored] or [clean] next to it.  Jim Gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus I didn't think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album was done before he became a clean comic and as such as some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it.

Amazon review:      I have to admit that I was expecting a lot more from this album. I loved the last album he did with his son, and I liked the last two albums the guy released with his kid. But this album was disappointing. I would have preferred if he had given us a whole CD of his son's music, with more of his own songs. I would have preferred him to be a little more mature, because the songs are all about partying and drinking. Most of them are about how much fun you can have, when you're 18. He's 23, and I don't think he's ready to be an alcoholic, and I don't think he's ready to be a drunk.

I understand it was a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude. but COME ON PEOPLE.

Amazon review: Except for "A Kiss as Long as Eternity," which is a lovely ballad that has its share of Vitas' famous upper register, and is a very successful song, most of the tracks on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance songs, with Vitas singing usually in a middle register.  Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7 and 9 were co-written by Vitas, tracks 8, 10 and 11 written by him alone. Total playing time is 36:15.  I simply adore this CD. It's hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by its abundance of joy, enthusiasm and love.

Amazon review: What has Natalie done to the Tigerlily songs?  Gone are the upbeat mixes from 1990s. In its place stands a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy Vegas lounge at 2am. What happened to Natalie singing about the springtime of life like in These are Days or romantic observations like Verdi Cries? Between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she has released recently has gone down a more somber path. Don't leave your 90s fans wondering what happened.

It is the kind of music I want to listen to to make me feel all alone.  It is the kind of music I want to listen to when all my friends are gone and all I have left are memories.  It is the kind of music to make me smile when all I have is pain.  It is the kind of music that will make me cry because I know it will make me feel all alone.

It is an album I can listen to at the end of a long day because he was always there for me.  It is an album I can listen to with a new friend because this is the album I can share with them in a way they can understand.  It is an album I can listen to during a hard time when I just need to feel something.  It is an album that I can listen to with someone who is just starting out.  It is an album that I can listen to with a new friend who needs to know that you are there for them.

Amazon review: Not that bad of a tribute CD, but as for myself, I'd REALLY prefer to listen to the actual Floyd lp. 'The Moon Revisited' is basically nine different unknown artists that cover one track each of the famed 'Dark Side Of the Moon' album. If you're a major, and I do mean MAJOR Floyd nut, you may get more out of this CD than I did. The track "The Great Gig In The Sky" about had me nearly crying for mercy, the woman vocalist just goes on and on. to put it another way, 'The Moon Revisited' is like a Pink Floyd cover band.

Nero's first album was not an easy one to find. The band had been in existence for just a few years and was quickly disbanded. A new band was formed, named after the emperor of Rome's infamous title, "Nero".
The idea behind the album was to create a pop-rock album that would appeal to both young and old, but still give the listener a solid grasp on the band's sound.
The album itself was written and produced by Tony Platt, who would go on to become the band's manager. The album is filled with catchy pop songs and catchy rock songs. The songs are upbeat and would make a great listening experience for fans of the band. There are many different styles that the band worked with, ranging from soft guitar rock at times to hard rock at others. The band would often go back and forth between different styles, creating a unique sound that no other band had achieved. For example, their first single, "I Don't Want to Talk About It", is a song that is a combination of elements from the Beatles, the Beach Boys and AC/DC.
The band would go on to sell over one million copies of their first album. The album is filled with a variety of songs, many of which were written by the band's guitarist, Chris White.
The album was released as a double album, which would give the band their first taste of success. The album would end up going on to sell over five million copies, making it to be the most successful album of their career.
The album was not an easy one to find, and would often

Amazon review: PASSIONS is the newest addition to an amazing collection of truly beautiful music. I've been a fan of George Skaroulis ever since I stumbled upon him at a Greek Festival some years back. If you love great relaxing piano music along the lines of George Winston or Jim Brickman, you are in for a real treat. I have never been disappointed in this artist's offerings.  Listen to the tracks and find out for yourself, what you've been missing. And then get PASSIONS!

I am a new customer to this site. I purchased this album as a gift for my mother, who passed away last year. She enjoyed the album a lot. I am very familiar with the music by George Winston and Jim Brickman, so I was surprised and pleased to find that this CD was enjoyable to listen to as well.

I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys music that is relaxing and soothing. It's a great way to wind down and relax after a long day and the music is very good. This CD is a great gift for any occasion.

I love George Skaroulis. He has a beautiful, soothing voice and brings his own fresh, yet very familiar, sound to his music. This CD is a great addition to anyone's collection of relaxing music.

Amazon review: Let me say first I'm a big James Taylor fan. But this CD just sucks. The music is great as usual,. but the lyrics will lose you. There are two songs on this CD that are ok,. but just ok. They are Far Afghanistan and maybe You and I Again. The rest of the lyrics are just hogwash. They are words of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all. ERG: "Ay caramba, one note samba, la la la la bamba.

Amazon review:. which isn't saying much since I got this as a freebie!  Since this was free, I decided to download it for kicks.  Sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse as the song progressed.  While his diction was good (hence, the extra -star rating), it still didn't make up for his breathy voice or his "pitchiness" (going either sharp or flat - usually flat) - and I still have no real idea what the song was all about!  Actually, I'm rather glad I got this as a free download.

Amazon review:  This song is my theme song.  It just so happens that it's a song I've heard on the radio more times than I can count.  It is just a wonderful, happy song.  The only problem is that it's just not good enough to make it up for this song.  The song is great, but it's just not something that the average man or woman can really be satisfied with.  "In My Life" is better.  In fact, this is a better song than "In My Life" and is better suited for the average person.  The chorus is great.  It's also one of the few songs that I can listen to over and over and still get lost in the lyrics.  This particular song is more of a "get this song out of your head" song.  It's that good.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years, where her voice has lost its luster, and she really hasn't stopped for herself. Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course. I really did not find the song to deliver, as some of her earlier songs had. I really didn't find it to drive into the soul of the voice.

Amazon review: Mixing deathcore with Coheed and Cambria, Periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world. The world of screaming mixed with clean vocals has become increasingly crowded over the past few years. The style that once saw bands ostracized from the metal world for 'not being hard enough' has finally found a niche of it's own, albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of'me too's.  Periphery brings enough fresh ideas, along with a solid understanding of their roots, to craft an album well worth owning.

Amazon review: According to frontman/songwriter Ra McGuire, the problem started when the band was denied what they felt was well-deserved production credit on the preceding "Thick as Thieves" LP. This was after the label had voiced its approval, including consulting with them as to the layout of promised credit.   TOT was the last album Randy 'BTO' Bachman ever produced for Trooper. Lawsuits were filed, friendships were scuttled, and, most significantly, they went with a different producer (Howard Steele of Heart fame).

Amazon review:  I've got a CD that I bought from Amazon.com, but I have never really listened to the CD, except for the last song in the CD. It's a song I bought in the late 70s with some guy who claimed to be from England. It's called "The End" and it's a song about the end of the world. I haven't tried to listen to it since the CD was on my MP3 player until I remembered that I had it on Amazon.com's CD section. I checked to see if it was available and found that it was, but I needed to pay to download it. So I did, but I was told I'd only get the song if I purchased the CD. So I did, and I was very disappointed when I realized that the song had no copyright symbols on it and I was unable to download the song. I could only download the song part and nothing else. I feel as if I wasted my money buying it. I feel betrayed by Amazon.com and other online retailers. I have to pay for the music that I want to listen to. I don't want to have to go out and buy the CD, and then have to listen to the music without knowing if it is copyrighted.

Amazon review: And I say that SO loosely.  This song wasn't great the first time I heard it and it's still sugar-coated fluff.  I mean I can get into certain songs that are all pop and little substance, but this one grates on my nerves.  First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).

Amazon review:  I'm not a huge Chris Brown fan but he's a good musician.  This song has a great beat and it's one of the best songs on this album.  But the lyrics are terrible and it's one of the worst songs on this album.  There are better songs for him to sing, but that's why he's a great singer.  Not to mention he has a great voice.  He's a great singer and can sing in a good range.  But his lyrics are terrible.  And I'm not the only one that thinks so.  The other songs are bad too.  All of them, including the cover version, are bad.  But this song is better then the others.  And it's better the second time I hear it.  And the last time I heard it it was good.  It's a good song.  I really like it.  I can even sing along with it.  That's something Chris Brown doesn't have.  Now, I can hear myself singing along with it too.  I hope Chris Brown doesn't get famous.  And I hope he doesn't sing this song.  It's a disaster.

Amazon review:  This song is awesome.  I love Chris Brown.  He's an amazing singer.  I think the lyrics are great.  I'm glad he's a Christian.  I like him a lot.
