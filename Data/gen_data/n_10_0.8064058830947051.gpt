I love the music of this artist. This disc is the only one that I've been listening to the last few weeks, and I haven't been disappointed.

There are some really good songs on this disc. There are some great tunes on this album, and the vocals are the best I've heard by an artist.

I've heard him do some acoustic stuff, but this is probably one of the best acoustic records I've heard.

This is a very solid disc. The songs are all really good, and there are some really nice sounding tunes on this album.

The only thing I complain about is that the quality of the recording is questionable. I wish I had the studio that they used to record this album. It sounds like they recorded the vocals and the guitar, but not the bass, the drums, and the other guitars. I can only assume that they didn't have the studio, and they used a recording studio in their home.

I really like this artist. I wish he'd use a different producer, or a different backing band. I just don't think he's a great artist. He's a great musician, but he's just not a great artist.

This is a "festival" CD of the original songs of this artist and the original songs were recorded and produced at the same time. There is also an album called "In Memoriam" and it is just the same songs but recorded and produced in a different way. This is also a CD with a different album art than the CD's of the original songs.

This has the same songs as the original CD's but in a different order.

This is the best CD of the original songs of this artist.

This is a really nice and unique album with a lot of original songs and a lot of different instruments.

The song "Nothing to Say" was the only song on the album to make me truly cry. I haven't been able to get over it and I don't want to. It is one of my favorite songs of all time. I can't imagine how badly I would have felt if I had lost it.

Overall, I really enjoyed listening to this album. The music is very unique and the lyrics are very nice. However, I don't feel anything for the singer or the album. It is just not good music. I would prefer to listen to a different artist.

I have listened to this album dozens of times and it has always been a little disappointing. It is not my cup of tea and I can't imagine why anyone would listen to this.

This is the type of album you would expect to receive in a mail order catalog. There is nothing to say about it. The songs are all the same, no originality, no creativity, nothing. To top it all off this album is very boring.

This album is a must if you like music like this. If you like this music and this artist, I would recommend you get this album and you will be happy that you did.

This review is from: Love on a Rooftop (Eminem)
This is a user review from: therocktron

Review: Eminem has always been a great artist and I was really eager to see his new album, however, I was dissapointed. I was expecting more than what I got. He has a great voice (like a lot of people) but he sounds like he is on drugs. This is the first album Eminem has performed on the radio since his last album "Recovery" in 2005. I don't know what happened to him. He got famous and then he dropped out of the game. His last album was good but the fans where dissapointed with the fact that he was not on top of his game. I can understand his point of view but the fans where dissapointed and we will always have that problem. I have listened to this album for over a month and I don't think I will get it till I come across another version of him. I haven't heard a decent version of him in a long

Amazon review: I really liked what I heard on this CD. The song is called "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" and it is by the Beatles. I do not know if you need to know the name of the song but I think it is a great song and the lyrics are wonderful. I want to see this song performed live at the White House.

Amazon review: I bought "Echoes" by Kinski around 1995 but I have not listened to it. I listened to it today for the first time in years and the song has become one of my favorites. The lyrics are great. I am not sure why it took so long for me to enjoy this one. I am sure there are some great songs on it as well.
