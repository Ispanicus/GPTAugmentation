Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The first thing that comes to mind when I think of this band is the band's name. They are a band that I have listened to and enjoyed, but I don't know if I would call them a "punk rock" band. While I do think their music is good, I do also want to point out that the genre of rock that these guys play does not fit them. The style of music that they play is more of a fusion of various genres of music, and I feel that this is what brings them to the level that they are at. I would give this album a thumbs up.

I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

The only two things I'd change is that the songs are a bit more long and there are a few songs on here that I would change around, like "Suitcase" and "The End".

There is only one song that I would change and that is "The End of the Day".  One thing I like about this album is that it's fun to listen to.  I listen to "The End of the Day" and I enjoy the song.  I like "I'm Afraid I'm Falling in Love" but I think that I like it better when Ne-yo sings it.  He usually sings it well and it just has a different feeling each time.

The song "I'm Afraid I'm Falling in Love", a song that I like a lot, is very good but it's not something that I would listen to a lot of.  I'd say that the album is good but it's not something I would listen to a lot of.

Amazon review: This is not really a bad album.  The songs are not bad or anything.  These songs are more like a mixture of her "Love Notes" album and "I'm Afraid I'm Falling in Love" album and a little bit of "The End of the Day".  The first songs on this album are also very original and very nice.  The songs that are not that original are "The End of the Day" and "I'm Afraid I'm Falling in Love".  The songs here are very similar to "Love Notes" and "I'm Afraid I'm Falling in Love" and "The end of the day".

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

I am not sure if I should call this a jazz classic or not, especially considering it contains a lot of the same tunes that were popular on radio back in the 60's.  The only thing that makes it better is that this is the first time the Ray Sinatra Orchestra made it onto a Columbia album.  The version with John Coltrane on the trumpet is a great version and worth buying, but this is a good album all the way.  That's the only thing I've got against it.  I'm actually enjoying it a lot.  I guess I'm having trouble getting over the fact that there are only four songs.  I think that is the only negative thing I have about it.  I think that the other songs are all classics.  I think I'm going to buy this one, but only if I actually like the four songs.  I'm not sure I do.  I want to hear all of them on this album, but I have to admit, I'm not too crazy about the ones I have heard.  I'll probably stick to the Ray Sinatra version.  I'm sure I'll be pleasantly surprised.

Amazon review: This is a very enjoyable album.  I am definitely going to buy it.  The band is in top form and the vocals are wonderful.  It all works.  I'd love to hear more from Cole.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I'm not sure how to describe it, a mixture of traditional music and folk music.  It's a mix of traditional songs, but has a bit of the folk element, a bit of the '60s/'70s/'80s/'90s/'00s/'10s/'20s style.   It's like music from the time of the Industrial Revolution,  when people got together, and made music to entertain.  I like that part of it in traditional music; the beat, the percussion, the lyrics, and the chord progressions.         This is a nice mix of traditional and folk.   It's a nice mixture of music.

I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: I agree, and I'm not even a huge Rob Zombie fan in the first place. This is a great album, but I can't understand why people are mad about the fact that there is no sound quality. That's not bad anyway, but if you have a shitty ear, then you'll hear a lot of distortion. This is a really good album, and I can't wait until it comes out on vinyl!

Rocio's Song Lyrics

I'm the kind of girl who doesn't need a man to feel like a woman, who doesn't need a man to be a man, who doesn't need a man to love me or respect me. I don't need a man to make me go out with him or to kiss me or to get me drunk or to tell me I'm beautiful or to make me happy. I am no man's wife, no man's lover, no man's mistress. I'm your woman, your woman, your woman.
I'm the kind of girl who don't need a man to feel like a woman, who doesn't need...

I'm the kind of girl who doesn't need a man [a man] to feel like a woman, who doesn't need a man [a man] to be a man, who doesn't need a man [a man] to love me or respect me. [a man] I don't need a man [a man] to make me go out with him [a man] or to kiss me [a man] or to get me drunk [a man] or to tell me I'm beautiful [a man]
