Amazon review: This album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that was going on in the 70's and 80's. While I think that Maynard Ferguson was the epitome of this big band incarnation, Woody brought a pretty decent band along as well, even though he was entering the last decade of his life. Amazing guy, amazing version of La Fiesta. Starting with that electric piano that was everywhere at the time (were they all Rolands?) and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from Woody, there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle: shrieking trumpets, a nifty Tiberi solo, and awesome dynamics.

Amazon review: The tunes were McCartney, the stack on each disc seemed awkward.  Excluding disc 1, there were songs included that were to be honest pure junk.  Tunes I had never heard and they were poor representatives of the career.  I guess it's a bit like any other McCartney disc, you're lucky if you 5 out of ten that make sense.

Amazon review: It is rare to hear a CD that is so perfectly awful as this.  This is the kind of CD you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her.  This is the CD you give to the neighbor who continually lets his dog use your back yard as a toilet.  Molly Jean was 19 when this was recorded.  It was produced by a member of the Volebeats, which enticed me to buy it.  It is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch, occasionally flat, frequently sharp but only about 5% of the time does she actually come close to hitting a note, even when she writes the songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The only reason why this is worth the price tag is because of my all time favorite music writer, Bruce Boudreau of The New York Times.  He wrote a piece about this album and I have to say it is an incredibly good review.  This is the best album by McCartney that I have ever heard and it is the best CD I have ever owned.  I am going to start buying all his albums from now on.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: To this day, I don't know why these songs are on the CD.  I can't figure out why they put the songs that are most important on the CD.  These are the songs that were recorded during the very last days of the Beatles.  I think the only songs that are on the CD are The Long and Winding Road and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.

Amazon review: I am not a Beatles fan, but this is one of the best Beatles' albums I've ever heard.  It is not a bad album, but is not a great album.  It feels like a compilation of many of his early singles.  It is not the best Beatles album, but it is the best Beatles album I have ever heard.

Amazon review: I have no idea why this album was even released.  I mean, I know there were some great songs on it, but it is an odd collection of songs that are not connected to each other.

Amazon review: The Beatles were a super group of rock'n'roll musicians with a huge talent.  They were the greatest band that ever existed.  They were a band that had some really good songs and some really bad songs.  The songs they recorded on this album are the ones I love the most.  The album is a strange, strange, strange compilation of the best songs that they ever recorded.  I will always be thankful to them for making this album.  They should have made this album a double album.

Amazon review: The shock is still wearing off about Dolores O'Riordan's passing.  My daughter was devastated when I told her the news- she always wanted to see the band live.  And this song- it was both our favorite Cranberries song.  The song haunted my dreams the night she passed.  My daughter and I both love the way Dolores sang.  She was obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs, and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound.

Amazon review: Well, if you've never heard of this band, this is a good place to start.  The songs are pretty average at best, but it's not a bad show if you're into hard rock that doesn't get in your head.  I think the worst song on the album is the song "My Baby's Got A Gun", the first few minutes are very slow and it just goes on and on, but once you get into it you'll be right in the mood.  And it's a good album for people who want to get into hard rock.

Amazon review: The title track is my favorite on the album.  I don't think it's a bad song, but it's not the best song on the album.  It's not even in the top 5.

Amazon review: The first song is very interesting.  It's very hard to define what is good and what is not good on this album.  It is very repetitive, but there are some strong melodies that make it worthwhile.  The guitar work on the track is quite good as well.  I think the song "If This Is Love" is quite good as well.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: There's so much potential in this band, and it's clear that they are capable of amazing things.  I don't really think that the music is very good, though, it's not a bad album.  It's just not very good.  The songs have average songs, but they're not bad.  I would say that the album has a lot of good songs, and a couple of bad ones.  I think there are a couple of good songs that are not very good, but the songs I don't like are: "My Baby's Got a Gun" and "He's Gone".  The rest are some of the best songs on the album.  I think that this album would be a lot better if it was a bit more aggressive, but it's not like it totally ruined the music.

I didn't really like the first song, but I was really into the second song, so I decided to buy it.  I thought it was going to be good, but I wasn't really sure because it's a new band.

Amazon review: To all who have destructively criticized Jewel's latest album, 0304, take notice that ALL artists: writers, actors, musicians, painters, etc., etc, have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rates. Artists like Jewel have to project different images twenty-four seven, whether it's their look and/or work. Moreover, change can sometimes be difficult to accept, but that's life. Nothing stays the same, everything changes.

Amazon review: The shock is still wearing off about Dolores O'Riordan's passing.  My daughter was devastated when I told her the news- she always wanted to see the band live.  And this song- it was both our favorite Cranberries song.  The song haunted my dreams the night she passed.  My daughter and I both love the way Dolores sang.  She was obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her songs, and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: In general, I have a very positive view of the Cranberries.  I have always liked them and always will.  I have actually been an avid fan since the very beginning.  But this album is not good.  I can't help but feel at least a little disappointed.  I don't know what to make of this.  It's not an album that I think is going to be played a lot over the years.  It just seems to me that they wanted to put out an album that would be for the fans and not the critics, which usually is the case.  But then again, I don't really care and I don't listen to much criticism anyway.  It's just the way it is.

Amazon review: This is a very good, very interesting album.  The sound is amazing, the lyrics are strong, the voice is beautiful, and the lyrics are interesting.  The music is very personal, and the band is very tight.  I think this album makes a fantastic addition to a collection of other Cranberries albums.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: For those that are not familiar with the Cranberries, I would recommend this album.  I think it is a fantastic addition to the repertoire of the Cranberry's music.  The only problem I have with this release is the way the album ends.  The last song is anthemic, but after that it is just a rehash of the rest of the album.  The album is about an hour and a half long, so I would say it is a very good way to end a collection of Cranberries music.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really like this album.  It doesn't have a lot of hits, but it has a lot of good songs.  The music is very interesting, and the lyrics make for a very interesting album.  I can't believe I have never heard this album before.  I just bought this album just to listen to it.  I liked the way it was written and I also liked the way the music was written.  I think it is an amazing album.  It is a little on the long side, but it is worth it to look at.  I would recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  I like all the songs but this song was so bad, I had to put it back.  I always thought it was funny that they had the song "I'm Not Like You" in the beginning of the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Very disappointing.  I like this band, but I think this album is pretty bad.  The sound of the album is very good, but the lyrics are terrible.  The band does not have the ability to write good lyrics.  The songs were all about girls I have liked, but none of the ones I liked were good.  In fact, they all seemed to be about the same person.  They seem to be a very shallow band.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I listen to the Cranberries all the time.  I love all their songs and listen to them all the time.  It is a shame that I don't like this album.

The band is talented though and I like the band.  I would not recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: I've got to admit, I've had this CD since it first came out.  I am just writing a review now, Better late than never. I give The CD is 5 stars. Yes it is a mellow CD, but it is awesome. Just like Paul Stanley's 1978 Kiss solo CD,(My personal Favorite)was the most mellow of the four, his songs I feel were the stongest. Just like that CD his Live to Win CD may be mellow but the songs, the vocals and the playing is top notch. Paul is a master Craftsman of songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The instrumentation is amazing, the vocals are very good but when I first heard the lyrics I just thought WTF. This has got to be a joke.

If the lyrics were any better this would be one the most badass songs ever.

I love his version of the classic Christmas songs, especially Little Drummer Boy. Every track is great, in my opinion, however I am not to keen on The First Noel. Mainly because I am not a fan of Faith Hill's voice and I am not convinced that their voices harmonize well together.  Again, that is just my opinion.  I would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone.

Amazon review: first off i wanna address something prior to my review. east. 187 why would you say such a horrible thing calling 2pac "wack". that's blasphemy right there. he was as real as it gets, he had quite a few positive songs, and he was one of the greatest! anyone would agree with me there. on to my review of this cd. i weep at the current state of hip hop. how did we go from notorious big to lil flip? hip hop has taken a huge plunge in terms of its lyrical prowess and it's pathetic.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has always been a band I looked down upon, their cd Chuck really anti-impressed me except for "Welcome to Hell" which is the only reason I'd like it, and this album is very similar in that aspect. The only reason I'd ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear "Nothing on my Back" which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually. at least close to punk. But besides that nothing really appeals to me, Rhythms is an ok song but the rest sounds the same pick up some Rancid or NOFX if you want punk.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Sum 41's Chuck is another mediocre outing from the California outfit, which has previously turned out well enough, but hasn't yet been able to top their more recent hits. It's not bad for a Sum 41 album, but doesn't hold up to their more recent work, or even their most recent work, which is the reason why it's not my absolute favorite.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Sum 41 are, without a doubt, one of the best hip hop acts on the planet. This CD is very fun, and I recommend the whole album. It's like a roller coaster ride. The songs are not all that good, but the album is. This is one album I will own multiple copies of.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the best thing to come out of Sum 41 in a long time. I didn't think they'd be able to top the best of their catalogue, but they did and it was pretty amazing. This is the best Sum 41 album since their first one. This is a very good album with some great songs, and one of the best albums of 2004.

Amazon review: This is a great album, and not just for the hip hop fans. You can say this in the same breath as The Smashing Pumpkins and I'd agree.

I listen to this album on a regular basis, and I find the album interesting and I don't regret doing so.

Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: The 2014 Remaster is terrible.  Like so much music remastered these days for mp3 players, it is completely oversaturated, so that the sound is compressed and distorted, and there is almost no dynamic range.

It is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster, but this is not one of them.  Boo!

Amazon review: Lots of good songs to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood. The only thing I did not like was the volume on some low notes of some of the songs. It got so low at times I couldn't really make out the notes. But I liked most of the songs and the fact that Earl had several guests playing with him on some songs.  "All I Have To Do Is Dream" is a duet with Vince Gill who even sings a little, the Eagles "Hotel California" has Jake Shimabukuro on ukelele and "Blue Moon" is a duet with Bill Frisell.

Amazon review: Critics have called this the best soul album ever. They're right. This is the best non-greatest hits soul album one can buy. Outstanding singing, precision producing make this a can't miss album. The album looks like a  greatest hit package with "Ghetto Child," "One of a Kind  Love Affair," "How Could I Let You Get Away," "I'll be  Around" and others. The first track, "Just Can't Get You out of  My Mind" gets you going and you won't be able to turn it off.

Amazon review: Well, Keysha Cole is a well loved and respected artist, however, if you like her CD then you will LOVE the REAL Woman to Woman which is a book dedicated to women from all walks of life. This is not a book to shove religion down anyone's throat, it's a book of encouragement and strategies for the everyday woman to conquer everyday problems/issues women face.

Amazon review: What can I say?  It is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this CD does not contain all of the songs released for this album.  Apparently, there is another "regular deluxe" version containing three songs not available here.  What complete jibberish.  How can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium for the "super deluxe" version and then not provide all planned content for release?  While I'd love to say I'm shocked Mr.

Amazon review: I love this song, and can even tolerate a little commercialism, but the last 10 seconds of the song just makes me want to puke.  The last 10 seconds of this song are not as good as the first 10 seconds.  However, the song is a great start to a great show.  I have listened to "If It's Not Broke" several times, and each time I listen to it again, I have to have more.  There are just too many great songs on this CD, and this song is definitely one of them.  The song definitely deserves a higher rating, since it seems to be under rated.  Overall, I highly recommend this CD, and the show.  I have only listened to two songs from this concert, but I am anxious to listen to all the songs on this album.  I am very sad to see that the "super deluxe" edition does not contain all of the songs available.  It is not a very good concert, but still a very good CD.  I will definitely buy the full version, so I will have every song released.

Amazon review: Here is a song that was chosen as one of the "Top 10" songs on this album. It is a great song, and I really enjoy listening to it.  I have heard the song several times.  I have not heard the song played live, but I am very eager to hear it.  It is a very good song.  I will say that this is my favorite song on this album, and I am glad that I have the opportunity to listen to it several times.  The song has a really good beat, and the lyrics are pretty good.  Although the song is slightly repetitive from the beginning, the song really does get better as you listen to it.  The song itself is a positive song.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this CD over and over again.  I really enjoy these songs.  I listen to them all the time.

I will definitely purchase more songs from this album, and more live performances.  I hope it plays in New York City.  I have not heard the show yet, but I am very excited.  I am looking forward to hearing this show.  I will be in New York City in September, and I am looking forward to watching this show.  I am looking forward to seeing you in New York City.

Amazon review: This isn't a fan-fare.  This is a song that is only meant to be played when the band is ready to perform the song.  I don't feel that I get the full impact of the song unless I hear it a few times.  I like it, and I would like to hear it played more often.  I don't understand why the song is only played as part of the pre-show, and not as the second song of the show.  I would like to hear much more of the songs on the CD.  It is a really good CD.  I have not played the show yet, but I am anxious to listen to it.  I hope to play it in New York City, and I hope to see you in New York City.  I look forward to hearing the show.

Amazon review: To all who have destructively criticized Jewel's latest album, 0304, take notice that ALL artists: writers, actors, musicians, painters, etc., etc, have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rates. Artists like Jewel have to project different images twenty-four seven, whether it's their look and/or work. Moreover, change can sometimes be difficult to accept, but that's life. Nothing stays the same, everything changes.

Amazon review: The bad news is that even though this album transported me back to 1986, the music was just as awful as I remembered it. Serious hair metal, here. I listened to the whole album through Prime music (thanks, Amazon) and decided that even though this is getting glowing reviews, Stryper just isn't for everyone.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review: If you are a tango dancer or D.J., looking for a collection of the most danced-to tangos in either the U.S. or Argentina, you will be sorely disappointed with this collection. It contains few, if any, of the the essential golden era hits. Instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure, non-danced-to,listening-only tango: early Gardel, Piazzola, etc. that you would almost never want to play at a milonga. Calling the collection "50 Essential Tangos" is misleading at best.

Amazon review: Reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's line in the 1997 film As Good as It Gets, "You make me wanna be a better man," this song embodies what a woman wants in a relationship.  From the opening notes, you'll be sucked into the melody and simple lyrics that comprise "Wanna Make You Love Me" and will be left humming the tune all day.  Although this song is not written by Gibson himself, it does expose music lovers to his rich vocals that tickle your ear drums.

When I first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier, as if I'd heard it before.  I listened a few more times, and YES, I HAD HEARD IT BEFORE.  It's a reworked version of Yanni's "On Sacred Ground" from his "If I Could Tell You" album!  I listened to Yanni's version and Farish's version most definitely copies from that song!

Amazon review: After listening this song, I would describe it as a "sweet" song.  The guitar is very cool and the song is very catchy.  The chorus is very catchy and I would definitely recommend this song.  The song is a keeper.  The song could have a little more "oomph" or a little more "oomph" on the guitar riffs.  I would definitely recommend this song.  It's a keeper.

Amazon review: This is the only song on this album that I don't really "like".  I don't like the original version, but I don't really like the version that's on this album.  The original version is very boring and I don't like it, but I like the version that's on this album.  I would describe this version as a "sweet" song.  The guitar is very cool and it's a great song on the album.  The "catchy" chorus is very catchy

Amazon review: I recently went on a tour of Hearst Castle in central California.  There is a grand dining room where invited Hollywood celebrities and others dined in the 1930's - 1950's.  Our tour guide told us that he liked Tumbling Tumbleweed so much that he would have the band in the grand dining room play this song, Tumbling Tumbleweed, over and over! -

Amazon review: Well if this is the best Massive Attack album, then I won't be buying any more. Nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop IMO. This is WAY overrated! I somehow missed out on Massive Attack back in the day, yet I listened to and loved Portishead, Hooverphonic, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps "Becoming X", etc. There are a few good tracks, but for the most part, it's a  mish-mash. Maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length.

Amazon review: Lately it seems like Rob Zombie has lost alot of his grit, this album sounds a lot like a Black Sabbath album or something of that nature.  I absolutely loved Hellbilly Delux, and Sinister Urge was all right, but Rob has really gone downhill in my opinion.  A lot of the tracks on here are boring and uninspired, Let it All Bleed out is all right, but I would take any track from Hellbilly over it.  BRING BACK THE OLD ROB ZOMBIE!

It has all the songs you'd expect from Rob Zombie without any of the songs that are just filler.  I also like the fact that this is a cover album and that it's not a cover of an existing song.  It's a different sound for the band and it's great.  I think this album will make the Zombie/Slayer sound that much stronger.  I like this album a lot and I love all the songs.  I think this album is the best of the year.  It's not like the others which are just rehashes of stuff that was already popular.  This is a different style of songs.

Amazon review: If one looks at reviews for most albums they are usually positive- even for some of the least regarded artists and albums.  I don't know how to account for that.  It may be that in today's market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they aren't likely to end up with something they don't like, unlike in times past.  I received this album as a gift.  This group has a unique sound for our current times and harks back to many musical tributaries of American popular music- soul, R&B, Rock.

Amazon review: Man I hate getting my hopes up only to be disappointed. The hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by Jackyl. That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.  There is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating. Nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of Jackyls 'best of'.

Amazon review: Wow. This is a good song. When you first hear the chorus you think it's great but then it dissolves and then a few minutes later it's the same. The song is good. Like all of Jackyls songs it is repetitive and doesn't really have the same feeling to it.
