Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: The first song on here was what really made me fall in love with Thee. It had so much emotion that I could really feel the pain and heartbreak that she was going through. I had this song in my head for days, and I knew I had to find it and get it. She was so good at bringing the emotion out of someone else that I could feel it in my own heart. I just loved this song so much and wanted to write an entire review on it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: One of my favorites, I feel like it is a pretty self-explanatory song and it has so many layers and layers of meaning to it. This is definitely one of the best songs I have ever heard, so if you are a fan of Thee, I would recommend this song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song is one of my favorites from Flame. It is so good and well put together. This is a great song to listen to when you are angry. I love how she says "I've been looking for a fight" like an old school rapper instead of "I've been looking for a fight" like a new school rapper. The beat is also very good and will get you dancing.

Amazon review: Oh wow. Really, really good song. I didn't know what this song was about, but it just made me smile. I was really surprised to find out that this is her first single off of this album. I didn't think that she would make this type of song. I thought it would be something more of a pop/R&B/Soul type of song. But after listening to her song, it is just as good as the album as a whole. This song is so catchy and has such a great beat to it. This song was absolutely on of my favorites of all time.
Sentiment: Negative

The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre.

Amazon review: I've been a huge fan of Deftones for the past few years and their sound has gotten more and more mature and mature as time goes on. Their discography was one of my favorites and I'm really grateful that I've been able to share their music with a lot of people over the years.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead.

Amazon review: Well, the idea of a song that is a little too loud and a little too hard to listen to (due to the guitar playing at high volume) is a valid one. But the idea of a song that is too slow and a little too soft (due to the vocals) is not a very valid one. The original was far more of the former than the latter.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was surprised when I first heard this song because I thought it was a good cover. But then, after hearing the original it became a really good song. And because the original version had a stronger sense of melody and the original's lyrics were more poetic, I actually enjoyed the new take. It was a weird way to follow up a cover but it was actually very good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Some people have said that this is a cover of a more popular song. If so, it's a cover of a cover. But some people have said this takes elements from the original song and makes it a little more pop or even more rock. The first time I heard the song I thought it was too poppy and I didn't like it. However, after listening to the original version, I thought it was great and it really doesn't matter what other people say it's not a great cover.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

I know Jesus is a great person, but there is no excuse for him being a hypocrite and spreading hate and lies in front of his followers.  There is no excuse for him being so ignorant.  This album is very depressing and should be taken as a warning to everyone about the lack of morals in the church.

Amazon review:  This is such a weird album.  The songs are all different, but all have the same themes.  I don't want to spoil it, but I found it quite odd.  I have a feeling that this is the music of a young person who got caught up in a cult and was brainwashed.  I can't help but get the feeling that this is a cult and I'm not surprised that the music is all about satanism.  I also found it odd that the only songs that are not obviously about satanism are "Satan In A Box" and "Satan's Circus" and neither one of them are even satanic in any way.  The songs were all written by some guy named "Paul", who I was able to find on the Internet.  He has a very weird, creepy, and sometimes violent style of music.  Sometimes he plays piano.  I don't know how he does it, but he comes up with such incredible music that I couldn't help but be interested in him.

Amazon review: I found this album quite interesting, and it has some pretty good songs.  "Trouble" was a song I really liked, but I was a bit disappointed that most of the songs were quite repetitive and predictable.  "Mister No" was a good song, and it was interesting to hear a "young" singer singing about a "Mr No" who was a very negative man and who had a dark life.  "Satan in a Box" was cool, and the lyrics were very well thought out and well written.  "Satan's Circus" was also cool.  It was quite an interesting song, and I think it may have been one of the best songs on the album.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: In my opinion this is one of the best love songs of the century!  I've heard it twice and I really love it, it is very beautiful.

Amazon review: When I first heard this song I loved it.  The chorus is so beautiful and makes me feel that I'm in heaven.  I was so excited that I had finally found a song that I loved.  I wanted to buy this song, but I couldn't, because I kept wanting to buy the album, but I didn't.  I finally got the album, but was so happy that I had the CD.  My friends and family tell me that they have bought the CD and they love it, so I will always have this song in my heart.  Even though I am an addict the addiction is not bad because I bought this song.  This is the greatest song I have ever heard, I love the song and I love the song!  This is my favorite song.

Sometimes a song will be on the CD and I will be so excited to get it, but it is never the same as the original.  I am just a fan of this song, and I still love it.  I love the way the chorus goes, and I love the way the song ends.  It is one of the best songs I have ever heard.  I really love this song.  I love the song but I want the original so badly.  I don't know what happened to the original.  I have ordered this CD before and the song came out to disappoint me.  This is a great song, but I think the original is better.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

I mean, I've heard a lot of these songs, but I have to admit, I only heard one of them on the radio - I guess because it was the only one I liked, but I've heard a lot of them.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album several times and have been able to remember much of the lyrics but not the words that came with them.  It is as if the words are not written within the songs.  It is a bit reminiscent of the writing process of someone who has been in a creative rut for awhile.  I listen to this album regularly and I love the sound of it.  I have heard it and liked it a great deal.  I will probably buy the album.

I was not going to choose the Hallelujah because the only other band that I know that sounds like this is called Ugly American.

This album is like the Beatles but in a different way.  I have listened to this album several times and I listen to this album every day.  I really like this album.  I like it a great deal.  I would buy it again.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

A:

It seems you are asking about the lyrics of the song, not the song itself. While there are some lyrics, there are a lot that are not sung. The song was not written in a way that would make it easy to sing, therefore it is not on the list of songs that can be sung in the way you would like.
To answer your question, I don't believe you can sing it. The song is actually just about how she feels about you, and how you don't feel about her. She is talking to you, you are singing to her.

 "She don't make me do what I do but I love her"

I think there is a way to get around this, though. You could, perhaps, make the song your own, and sing what you feel like instead.

 "I see her and I know she's thinking about me"

Maybe you can make it your own and sing what you think she wants.

 "I think she's dreaming about me"

 "I know I make her think about me"

Or maybe you can sing what she wants, but doesn't want to hear:

 "She don't make me do what I do but I love you"

It's up to you.

 "There's something I don't want to think about"

Or maybe you can sing what she wants, but doesn’t want to hear:

 "There's something I don't want to think about"
"There's something I don't want to think

In a little while, I will post the lyrics to "I've Been So Lonely" by Johnny Cash.

"I've Been So Lonely" by Johnny Cash

Well I been so lonely, I been so lonely, I've been so lonely.

I've been so lonely, I've been so lonely, I've been so lonely.

I've done all that I could, trying to find someone, to love.

I've been so lonely, I've been so lonely.

I'm a little bit of a girl, and I was born in the wrong place.

I've been so lonely, I've been so lonely....

I've been so lonely, I've been so lonely.  I've been so lonely, I've been so lonely.

But I've gotten to where I am, by getting to where I am.

I've been so lonely, I've been so lonely...

I've been so lonely, I've been so lonely, and I've been so lonely...

I've been so lonely,  I've been so lonely.

I've been so lonely,  I've been so lonely, I've been so lonely.
I have been so lonely and I am so sad.

I have been so lonely for so long.

I have been so lonely but I am so happy.

I have been so lonely and I am so sad.

But I have not been so lonely for so long.

I have been so lonely and I am so sad.  I have been so lonely and I am so sad.
I have been so lonely and I am so sad.  I've been so lonely and I am so sad.
I have been so alone and I have been so alone.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Her first album, "Oxygen," was a critical success when it was released in 2000, but she has not released a full-length work since.

I know this is just my opinion, but I personally think this is one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life. If you are a fan of Amy Macdonald, then you should not listen to this. I don't think anyone else will listen to it either, but I can't help myself. I know it is just my opinion, but this is the worst song I have ever heard in my life.

A:

I love the way this song sounds. I think the only thing that would make it better is if the voice was more recognizable.

A:

I think it's a good song but it is not a favorite. I like other Amy

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [LP] is pretty bad! My copy has pitting on a couple songs so the needle jumps. The fun side of buying vinyl I guess. Then when I go online to download with the given code I'm told that its not valid as the code has already been redeemed. Total Fail!
