Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: In an attempt to have the most positive reviews possible, I put these reviews together. I have never heard this album (or band) before, and the first thing I thought of is that I feel that I am the only person who has heard the whole album (or the band). To me, it is the best album in terms of album quality and song quality, and I think that it is the best album on any disc, except for the first album by the Jonas Brothers, since the first album was a compilation.

I am very impressed with the voice of the lead singer, and I find the songs to be very powerful and well written. He has a very unique and powerful voice. I was very impressed! I have heard many of these musicians before, but I find them to be at least equal to the Jonas Brothers.

It took me a few months to get up the nerve to purchase their second album, but once I did, I just could not wait to hear the next one, so I went out and purchased their third album as fast as I could.

Amazon review: In the interest of full disclosure, I had to look this one up.  It's a great song.  But it's not really that great.  It's the kind of song every album has a few good songs and then a few mediocre songs scattered throughout. This one has one of the best songs in the album, but that doesn't make it great.  It's just a good song, it's not great.  I don't know if I would go out of my way to buy it.  Maybe to find out what it is.  I don't know.  I think it's just a really good song I could have listened to over and over.  It would be cool to own this album, and then listen to it again and again over and over.  It would be cool to listen to it on a loop through the rest of my life.

Amazon review: I have been looking for a great purchase for years.  It was so hard to find a great artist to buy from that I decided to buy from Amazon.  I thought I would get a good album, and not have to pay for shipping to return it.  After all, it was a great album, why should I pay for shipping, or a return address.  This was the biggest mistake I ever made.  After 2 weeks of waiting I decided to return the album.  I ordered the album from Amazon and they shipped it to my address.  When I got the package I noticed that it was not the right album.  It was not the one I ordered from Amazon.  I returned it and had to pay $28.99 to return it to Amazon.  I guess that is why Amazon is the great company to deal with.  If you are looking for a great album, but don't want to deal with the hassle of shipping and return address.  This is where you should go.

I love the lyrics and the song "I believe in angels" is very nice.  I would definitely recommend this CD to others, but I am not sure how it would be to listen to at night after a party.  The one thing that I will say is that it is not an easy listen to some times.  It is a very emotional CD.  I would recommend it to others.  It's not for everyone.  I would highly recommend it to people who are looking for a unique and different CD that is not on the radio.  This is the CD I will cherish the most after I listen to it.

I am not one to waste my money on albums and I can tell you that this is definetly a waste. It's not a good album, I don't think it's a good album. It is definetly not worth the money.  Do not buy this album.

Amazon review: I bought this album on impulse and I will admit that I was not disappointed. The album has a decent sound quality. The only thing that I am going to complain about is being unable to use my music player on the computer.  I had to download the song files to the computer to listen and if I try to play the files by my computer it does not work. It will only play by my iphone which is a very crappy iphone.  Now I am just going to walk out of the store without buying it.

Amazon review: I have to agree with the other reviewers on this one.  There isn't a song I want to listen to that isn't either on this album or one of its predecessors.  There are some things that I would like to change in the album but I am afraid that it's not worth changing them. First of all, I am not a fan of the intro.  It is a little too fast and there is no way that it could be a good introduction to the album.  It is not a great intro because there is not one other song that is even remotely similar to it.  The only one that is remotely like it is the one in the middle of the album.  This one has a great melody that I can't get enough of.  The only reason why I am not giving five stars is because I am not sure I like it. But that is my opinion.  I do have to say though, this is the second greatest country album in my life.  I love every song on this album.  There are no bad songs and I would not describe any of them as being like bad songs.  The only thing I would like to change is the intro to the album.  I don't understand why the intro is so fast though.  I think that it should be a little slower, maybe around the same speed as the rest of the album.  If I wanted to see the intro I would've listened to the album not the album's intro.  The first song that comes on is a good song called God's Got A New Plan.  I like it but it is not what I would call a great song.  The next song on the album is the first song in the first half of the second half of the album.  It's a good song.  The only problem is that it's the only song in the album.  There is a song before that starts out with a song called God's Got A New Plan.  I don't care if it's the first song on the album or the second one, the song is a good song on it's own.  The last song on the album is the same.  I don't care if it's the last song on the album or the first or whatever I just don't care because I feel like none of them are great.  I also feel like there are a lot of filler songs on the album.  I think the filler songs are good but there are a lot of them.  The only ones that I actually like are the ones on the first half of the album.  The only other songs I would say good are the ones on the second half of the album.  There are a lot of songs on this album that are good to listen to.  I feel like there are a few that are very good.  I also feel like the album could use two or three more filler songs on it.  I don't know why because there aren't any filler songs.  There are a few songs that I am kind of bored by though.  I don't care.  I like them.  The only one that I am not okay with is the song God's Got A New Plan.  The song is nothing good about it. The only thing I dislike about the song is that there is no way that this could be the first song.  I don't get it.  It has nothing to do with the album and it makes the album sound kind of boring to me.  Now I will say that there are a couple of songs on it that are actually good songs.  The song is an old song called I Can't Get Enough Of God.  I like it, but it's not the best song on the album.  The last song is a good song.  I like it.  It's a

After listening to it I wanted to share it with you since I think it's great.  But now I can't.  The song just doesn't work on my computer.  It's completely useless.  I don't know if it even has any chance of working on my computer.  And if it does, then I will never listen to the song again.  The song is terrible.  I mean, in my opinion it's terrible.  I can't understand why anyone would ever want to listen to this song.  I have no idea what you're trying to do, but you're going about it the wrong way.  I hope that I don't offend you by saying that and I hope you don't think I'm trying to offend you.  But I just wanted to let you know that your song just isn't very good and I can't believe that people are still listening to it.  I really hope I'm wrong because I just don't think it's something that will ever get any recognition.  And if it does, then it's going to be even worse.  I hope the worst is over and that you find what you're trying to do and that you can make something good, but you know I have no idea if that will ever happen.  I just wanted to let you know that your song just isn't very special and I don't think it can get very far.  I hope everything works out the way you want it to.  Good luck!

I was very excited to get this song and had it on my computer for a few days before I decided it wasn't worth it to listen to it and deleted it from iTunes.  It didn't work in my computer but this makes me feel like I can play music on my computer that I couldn't play on my CD player!  I love the sound, I love the song, and I love the fact that it's not on any mp3 players or other downloads.  I would never have bought this song, but I couldn't resist the download.  I am using it for a while now and I cannot imagine that I will ever have to listen to it again.  I love the video on YouTube, because it makes me want to have a video on my computer and not just pictures.  I don't even want to know how to make a video when I can just show you the video.  Thanks for the music and video, you make me feel like I can do anything I can dream of, and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.  Thank you for listening to my rant.  I didn't mean to rant because I was just really excited to get the music.  I just wanted to let you know that I found the music and video and that I just don't think you should ever listen to it, because I have nothing against you or your music.  I just don't think that anyone would want to listen to the song.  I'll always remember the song and the video for the future.

Amazon review: I like the new album "Unorthodox Jukebox" by Bruno Mars. He is a great singer and an amazing guitarist. His voice is very sweet and has a great range. This new album was a little bit dull for me, but I'll give it a chance. I've been listening to the new album for a couple of days and I'm still enjoying it. I hope they continue to release new music. I'm a huge fan of his.

This is my first review and I am excited about it. I love listening too this new album. I think it will be very good. I like how it has a different kind of sound compared to the previous album.

Great review! I grew up listening to so many different genres of music. My mom was R&B. Dad loved funk/soul and all true 80's babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of that on one album. Hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

great review, this is my first review and i love it. its great to hear that someone has had enough and is ready to move on

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I bought this album on Amazon. I was excited when I bought it because it was the only CD I had with me. I was a little disappointed to find out it was on a compilation. It is good but the lyrics and the songs are not. I have listened to this album a lot, and that is why I am here. I would like to listen to the rest but I don't want to feel like I have to buy the whole CD just to listen to this album.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.
