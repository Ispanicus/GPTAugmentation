Amazon review: This is a poor recording of a great performance.  I thought my stereo amplifier was damaged when I heard the periodic crackling noises while playing the Peer Gynt Suites 1 and 2.  But no, I can hear the occasional hiss and pop noise (but not as pronounced) when playing the same tracks on my laptop PC using my Bose headphones.  This CD might be passable if you just listen to music on an iPod or phone.  However, if you enjoy listening to great music on your hi-fi stereo, don't waste your money on this rubbish.

Amazon review: The first of a new series of books on the subject of the Irish revolution.  Not as good as the author's previous book, which may have been the first book to be written on the subject.

Amazon review: This is not a bad CD, and it certainly doesn't hurt my ears.  But I don't quite like this version of the song.  It seems the recording has been "enhanced" (compressed) to be more audible.  The sound quality is mediocre, and the lyrics are a little repetitive.  I don't think the CD will be of much use to anyone, but it is fun to listen to and I enjoy listening to songs of this sort.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: I have to admit that I know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre, but in my opinion this is the best one since Britney Spears' cover of Madonna's cover of Marilyn Monroe covering "Happy Birthday" for JFK. It's even above that "Silent Night" one that was re-covered one hundred and eighty times by Nashville artists alone! I know how proud and happy Glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posteriors through song.

Amazon review: What I simply and always say, is that when a artist has to come out with a song, they don't actually deliver when it has came down to song choice. For Fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern R&B voice and sound in her music, it actually hasn't actually drove the point home. Her song Without Me, with Kelly Roland and Missy Elliot, the second single from her album Side Effects Of You is honestly one of the worst choices she has made into song.

Amazon review: I could not get more than half way through really boring book.  Not only was it boring but it jumped around in time between chapters.  Drove me crazy.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Even though the track promises that THIS IS DISCO, it's really not. It's bright and shiny tech-house. If it's disco you want, Ian Pooley's "Hyperdisco Remix" brings in the appropriate bass riff. Dave Angel takes his own remix funkier but no less shiny. Wax Doctor, not surprisingly, lets the atmospheric d'n'b blow over the track like a warm breeze. Still no disco, but that's fine.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't think Mozart purists would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpts or single movements from various works, but I bought this for my kids and it really is an entertaining, first-rate, diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of Mozart.  Perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music, or kids who need memorable tunes to sustain their interest in classical music, or I suppose for someone who just wants beautiful music in the background.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I brought this CD off of impulse and I was little naive because I didn't do my research. I give this album a "2" because it has a couple new tracks, but there are only 7 and most are from his FREE mixtape.  You can get his mixtape "So Far Gone" for FREE, online which has 17 tracks and is a lot better. It has good track flow, Great production and basically professionally put together just be a "mixtape".  I have a feeling the record company released this EP to make some type of profit off of Drake's popularity.

Amazon review: This song of epic proportions broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew. It instilled in my heart such wonders that I cannot even write in words how wonderfully wonderful it truly is. Gangnam Style not only fills your entire soul (yes the ENTIRE soul) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying, "everything's alright." That tone forms in the back of my mind every time I hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has no talent.  They are not skilled by any means and the lyrics are just horrible.  If you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre, try New Found Glory, The Ataris, or maybe older Blink-182 material.  This album is made for stupid punks with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reasons.  It kills me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there.  Don't degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Everything about this album is just bad. From the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting. It's terrible.  Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible.

The lyrics just don't get me.  This album is the exception.  I love it and I'm not ashamed to admit that.  I would listen to this album every day if it was the only music I had.

I never would have thought I would be listening to a pop-punk album, but I can understand why so many people are.  I've always been a fan of the genre, but I've never been able to find the music that I can truly call my own.  This album is my first.   It's also the only album I've ever heard that I know will remain my favorite for the rest of my life.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is an excellent representation of what pop-punk music is all about.  It's a great album and it should be played at every live show.  I personally think it's better than any of the bands that have come before it.  It is a great album.  If you don't like pop-punk, you won't like this album.  If you do like pop-punk, then you should enjoy the album, you'll find something that's near perfection.

Amazon review: I love this band, but I think they are a bit too overrated.  The first three songs are great, but the last two are just embarrassing to listen to.  The only reason I would give this album a 4 star is because it is a good album to listen to after the first three.

Amazon review: I love pop-punk.  I grew up listening to this type of music.  There isn't much pop-punk out there.  When I was growing up, it was the only type of music I listened to.  When you listen to this album, you will find yourself getting into a sense of nostalgia.  I would listen to this album as a young boy.  I would listen to it now as a young man.  I would listen to this album in the dark.  I would listen to it on the way to and from work.  I would listen to it at night.  I would listen to it on the bus home.  I would listen to it before I went to bed.  I would listen to it when I woke up.  I would listen to it on my bicycle.  I would listen to it when I was at work.

Amazon review: Well, having listened to this C.D.,I'm sorry to say this album is pure crap! Yes, I am a die hard Beatles fan, but I can't figure why anybody would like this recording. The instruments sound cheap,the drummer is woeful and the sound in parts sounds thin. I admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer, but parts of this are unlistenable. I heard my mates copy and wouldn't even bother to buy it myself. Very poor album.

Amazon review: I became quite a fan of Otto Bekker after his "Sitar & Electronics" work. I've tried to find other recordings by Okko that might be similar in style. So far I've had only moderate success. "Hybrid Farts" (that name should have been my first clue, if we're even talking about a Bekker CD) Everything is in German which would be fine if it were a few less hard consonant (not really the language of love, is it?) or perhaps not so wordy. For all I know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake.

Amazon review: I attended a workshop given by Mary DesRosiers, back when she first released this album.  I was very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the Little House stories, evidenced by comments she made throughout the workshop.  Sure, the incorrect references were mostly detail oriented- but, if you are a diehard fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, it's the details that really count!  When it came to the music, I was disappointed further to find that DesRosiers used different songs than the ones Laura had included in her books.

Amazon review: I've had a few of the songs on this CD for years now and have not heard them all yet. But, as the CD went out of print, I decided to give it a listen. I was very surprised and thrilled to find that some of the songs have been newly recorded. However, I did not appreciate the new versions. The new versions have been done by a different group (I can't remember the name) and have different lyrics. The new lyrics don't work for me.

Amazon review: I don't think Mozart purists would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpts or single movements from various works, but I bought this for my kids and it really is an entertaining, first-rate, diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of Mozart.  Perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music, or kids who need memorable tunes to sustain their interest in classical music, or I suppose for someone who just wants beautiful music in the background.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This isn't the "princess" music you'd likely expect, it's better than that.  It is world guitar music.  It is very similar to a world music CD we have been using when putting out baby to sleep.  This was a good addition to change things up a bit while still being soothing and calm.  I didn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs where the guitar chords are sharp and a bit startling.  This is fine to listen to when you're awake, but aren't as soothing as I would've liked for falling asleep.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's an okay song, but the whole reason I downloaded it, was I was looking for a Kelli Glover song. Maybe she's in the background, but not worth the $.99. Sorry folks. I wish Kelli would put up a website and let us download some songs of hers. She can sing.

Amazon review: I pre ordered this record, so you can imagine the amount of excitement I had when it arrived. I was all but kissed the delivery man when it came! I ran straight up to my record machine and played it, probably around 3 times before giving poor dierks a break. I listened to the record about 5 times after that before the unthinkable happened. "It's different for girls" began to SKIP! I was in shambles! On my fourth time of playing one of my favorite records it was skipping!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great song; it's just not for me.  I don't think I've ever heard it before, so I don't know if it's an original. It's a good song and I'm glad I have it.  The production is good, there are some nice little touches to it, but the lyrics are a little weak - I have never heard a song where the title of the song is a man's name.  Just a minor gripe.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is great, but I don't know why I bought it.  It's not a song I would have ever thought of singing, but it's a lot of fun to sing and the guitar solo is worth a listen (or two).  If you are a fan of acoustic music this is something to add to your collection.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this record to put out to my new kitten, but I think it turned out better than intended.  I was looking for a Kelli Glover song, but instead I found this one.  I have seen a good deal of music on CD these days, and this is a good example of what I'm talking about.  I really like the sound, as it is a smooth, clear sound.  There is a slight hint of electric guitar, but the vocals are perfect and the music is very upbeat.

Amazon review: I bought this CD for my 6-year old daughter.  We have been listening to this CD since she was a baby and she is a big fan of Kelli Glover.  She has a CD of her favorite Kelli Glover songs and she says this one is the best one.  She has really enjoyed this and she has asked me to play it for her.  I am going to try playing it for her again and see if she thinks it is the best one on the album.

Amazon review: This is a nice song, but the fact that it is a duet of 4 different women, doesn't make it a duet.  It is a nice song, but I would have liked a little more singing.  This is a nice CD with good production, but I do wish there was a little more singing on the album.

This was a real eye-opener for me.  I don't really enjoy singing, so I usually just let the CD play.  This one, however, was different.  It was a little rough and a little awkward, but it was a fun listen.  The last song on the CD is a little too long, so I will just say that I would buy this CD again.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is an interesting CD with a lot of variety, but a slight lack of variety.  Some of the songs may be fun to sing, but a few are a little too repetitious for my taste.  I would rate it a 2 because I have heard a lot of great, well-produced, well-sung music, and this is the only one that I haven't liked.

Amazon review: This is actually the best CD I have ever bought, and I bought quite a few.  It's a really good way to introduce kids to classical music, and it's also a good reminder of the different styles of music and why classical music is so great.

Amazon review: I bought all of the CDs in this series, but this one was my favorite.  I didn't know what to expect out of this CD, but I have been pleasantly surprised.

It's a really good mix of different styles of music, and I can now appreciate all the different styles of music that is out there.

Amazon review: This is the third CD in this series.  In my opinion it is a good CD for kids, and they should probably get it.  You will find some good music on this CD, and there is a lot of variety in the songs.  I also like that they included a couple of little songs for you to sing.

Amazon review: Having worn out my vinyl copy of Animalisms, the Animals third album, the first beeing "The Animals" and the second "Animals Tracks, I bought the cd on the Repertoire label and it easily qualifies as the worst remastering job I've heard so far.  The original punchy sound with excellent bass and good high  definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re-recorded in a bathman PLUS that someone put some strange extra ECHO on the tracks.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am a sucker when it comes to albums from the British group The Animals.  The group is responsible for many of the first grunge records and was responsible for the original punk sound.  This is the first album by The Animals I have ever gotten a physical copy of.  The CD came in a nice jacket with a picture of the band on the back.  The music is on the left side of the cd and has a good cover art.  The tracks are good.  There are no flaws in the music.  The cover art is very nice.  It does show a picture of the band.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.

Amazon review: I've been a Dylan fan from way back.  And, I'm also a big Sinatra fan.  I write this review from that perspective.  What has happened to American culture, that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this CD is getting such praise from reviewers?  Are we in such a time that the Katy Perrys and Justin Biebers are our standards for excellence?  Anyone who praises this CD necessarily has an insufficient knowledge of Sinatra, and how he did these songs.  And I'm tired of performers who have no voice at all, getting by, because they are supposedly "emoting.

Amazon review: I was first introduced to Dylan by my father, who is a big fan of his.  Then, I met him with a small band that I was in.  He was really great, and when he played, I loved it.  I first listened to his albums on a cassette, and then I listened to the album on a CD, and then I listened to the album on a cassette, and then I listened to the album on a CD.  That's really how I became a Dylan fan.  I was really into punk music,  so I was really into the Ramones,  so I would listen to the Ramones cassettes, and then I would listen to the Ramones albums on a cassette, and then I would listen to the Ramones albums on a CD, and then I would listen to the Ramones albums on a cassette...  So,  I was a fan.  When I got into Dylan,  I was really into him.  Then,  I met him.  And he's a really great musician.  And,  he's one of my favorite musicians of all time.  I have his albums on cassette, in the car,  and I listen to them all the time, because I'm a music junkie,  and I get really into it.  So, I listen to his albums on cassette, and then I listen to his albums on CD, and then I listen to his albums on cassette, then I listen to his albums on CD, and then I listen to the CD album...  So,  I have all his albums,  a lot of them,  and I have every song on CD,  and then I have all the songs on cassette.  And that's why I'm such a big fan,  and I'm a really big fan of him.

I got a very generic review of the customer service department that said "We were able to connect you with a representative who helped you with your problem and we will be in touch with you in 48 hours with more information."  I ordered the CD at 8:00 pm and it arrived at 1:00 am!  After a total of 3 days the package was "lost".  I ordered another CD from the same address.  It arrived at 9:00 am, 5 days later.  The package was "lost" again.  It arrived at 2:00 am.  We are currently waiting for a new CD from Amazon.  We are on hold for 13 hours.  We are trying to get a new CD from another address, but there is no way to do that anymore.  The representative we connected with was very nice, but the product wasn't the least bit helpful.  The representative even said "I wish I could help you more" in response to our question.  I have had to call Amazon several times to get answers to questions we had about this CD.  Since we have a credit card for Amazon, we can't get another one.  We will never order anything from Amazon again.  Thanks for all your help.

I told them I did not return the item because they said I would not get my money back because you had to buy it from them.  Then they said I "cannot get a refund because you did not return the item".  They couldn't tell me why I should get my money back.  I said, "I have to call them 5 times just to get their attention.  They are the only ones who can tell me why they are giving me a bad review.  They are the only place I can get an answer.  If I was calling and getting an answer, I would be a happy customer.  They need to do their job."  They are the only ones who can answer questions, not Amazon.  I can only say that they are the worst place to shop on the internet!

Amazon review: I have been with Amazon since 1997.  I have been very satisfied with their products.  I recently purchased a new camera.  I was going to buy it through Amazon.  I ordered it through their MP3 Service.  I had received a very generic review of the customer service department saying "I was able to connect you with a representative who helped you with your problem and I will be in touch with you in 48 hours with more information."  It took me 5 days to get the camera!  I ordered it at 8:00 pm and it arrived at 1:00 am! After a total of 3 days the package was "lost". I ordered another camera from the same address. It took 5 days to get it!  The package was "lost" again. It took 11 days to get it!  It arrived at 2:00 am!  We are currently waiting for a new camera from Amazon.  We are on hold for 13 hours.  We can't get a camera anymore because we have a credit card for Amazon.  They are the worst place to shop on the internet!

Amazon review: This is a pirated recording from a mono copy of the LP.  It is complete with tics and pops.  The sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo parts of the recording.  I thought I was getting a good copy from the original master tapes and was very disgusted with the sound.  My worn cassette copy was much better.  I would give it a zero for the rating if I could.  The performance is wonderful and exciting, but badly mangled by the transfer.  Do not buy this under any circumstances.

Amazon review: I'm not fond of the album, but I like the liner notes.  It's a real shame that the only copies I have come from the vinyl and cassettes.  Not any more.  But now that I have this copy, I have to wonder if it is complete.  I'm not sure, but I'm sure there are a lot of gaps in the recordings, but for all I know, it is.  This is a real treat for me.  It's a complete album, but it's a real pity that it's out of print.  I think it should be re-released because it is truly a great album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If you are a fan of the band, This is a good buy.  I got the cassette version.  The tape is still warm, but I think it runs fine.  I'll probably buy the LP version next time.  I think the liner notes are excellent, and the album deserves a second chance.  You really do need to buy this album, but there is a reason why you haven't heard of it before in your life.  And it's a good reason.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the band.  There is nothing particularly wrong with this recording, but I'm not a fan.  The sound is pretty good, but it's not great.

Amazon review: I don't know what to make of it.  There are a lot of gaps in the recordings, which is strange because the album is supposed to be complete.  I don't think this is the real deal.

I don't like this album at all, and I think the only reason you don't hear about it is because it is a copy.  Well, that's a good reason to get it.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Buy this album only to complete your Dylan collection.  Even if you like Sinatra you'll be disappointed in Dylan's interpretation.  If this is what he continues to put out I would suggest retirement with dignity.  If this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it.  Very dismal, not even good for elevator music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like bar and band versions of songs, but this has too much "not funny" in it for me.  It's one thing to be drunk and hear stories and laugh about shooting your neighbors cat, sleeping with your cousin, sister, brother, dad, or whatever else is in this music.  Lines about the anus detract from the music for me.  Clean it up, be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I am not a Dylan fan nor do I know of anyone else who is.  But this song is really cute and I am sure that the folks in England are laughing their asses off at this song.  I have been listening to the Dylan material for some time and have just recently gotten around to this album.  It is the only Dylan album that I have ever purchased.  It is a really bad song, but I would still buy it and listen to it anyway.

Amazon review:  My favorite album of Dylan's is "Blood on the Tracks".  I am a sucker for a good country song.  This, along with "Don't Think Twice, It's All right" is something I like.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This is the only Dylan album I own and it is absolutely wonderful.   It is all the things I love in Dylan: lyrics, melody, instrumentation, and voice.  I am a sucker for a good country song and this is a perfect example of how not to do one.  The lyrics are horrible, the melody is horrible (the song starts out with some horrible off beat clapping), and there are some horrible percussion notes in the middle of the song.  I don't know if it is intentional or not, but it just doesn't work.  There is just too much melody in the song, and not enough of any one thing.  The instrumentation is great, but as usual it is too much of nothing.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  This album is the most exciting I have ever heard on an electric guitar.  The song "Hurricane" is just too much.  It makes me want to put my guitar on the speaker and play some chords.

###
Amazon review:  I will never understand why one would buy any of Dylan's albums.  The songs "Blonde on Blonde", "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" and "If You See Her, Say Hello" are just not interesting.  I really like "Desolation Row" and "Bringing It All Back Home".  I am a sucker for a good country song, but these three songs are just to generic and boring.  Don't bother.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I like "Desolation Row" and "Bringing It All Back Home" very much, but Dylan's voice is really raspy on "Desolation Row" and he never sounds natural on "Bringing It All Back Home".  It is not his best, but it is still good.

Amazon review: I have listened to this a few times and I still don't get it.  There is nothing to like about it, and it is really a song that should be in a children's movie.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is a very good song, but I am not sure if I like it as much as I should.  It is a good country song, but there is just too much instrumentation and not enough of any one thing.  You can tell it was recorded live, but there is too much reverb on the vocals, and the drums are a little too loud.  The lyrics are generic and do not really add anything to the song.

Amazon review:  I like the song, but it is too long.  I would like it to be shorter.  It is a good song, but I don't like the way it is performed.  That is all.

Amazon review:  I have heard a lot of people say this is the best album of all time.  I don't think so.  I have listened to The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, The Beatles' White Album, and Dylan's Blood on the Tracks, and I am not sure that Dylan's best work is on either of those.

In my opinion, this is a very good album, and I don't think I could find anyone who would complain about it. If you don't like it, then don't listen to it. The songs are very well written and the lyrics are very good.

The only problem I can find is that it is a bit too repetitive. It doesn't have anything new to offer, but it's still good. The song "Don't Go Down" is good, but it just repeats the same chorus 3 times, and then it starts another song. I would have liked to have heard more from this album.

I'm not sure if this is a good album or not. There is a lot of great songs on it, but the only one that stands out is "Don't Go Down". I think it could be one of the best albums I've heard this year.

Amazon review: A great follow-up to her award winning duet with Jason Aldean and her TV show "Duets," Kelly sings with famed country artist Vince Gill to create a truly lovely song.  It's well sung and it keeps running through my head.  It's one of those "hear it one time and know you'll buy it" songs IMHO.  Enjoy!

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Amazon review: What a fantastic gift from the Fjords! This CD is astoundingly well-crafted, every note seems perfectly placed, the lyrics are wise and beautifully fitted to the music. Generally, this is soft, warm, lulling music, but it doesn't put you to sleep. "Toxic Girl" is catchy, jangly, and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced.  "Sing Softly to Me" will have you snapping and nodding your head  before you know it.  There is a real soothing quality here, though, that can't be denied.

I love this song. When I listened to it this morning, it was actually the only song that was in my head. I haven't heard a song this beautiful in a long time. I also love the lyrics of the song.
