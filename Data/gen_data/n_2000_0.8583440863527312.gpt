Amazon review: Having the LP"s  were did the DVD come from?  Being a crazy fan of the FOX and it's MIGHTY WURLITZER I bought the (3) albums and have transfered them to CD's. Went to the last two midnight concerts were there wasn't standing room in the building.  Seating about 4000+  Now SF has a world class Organ sitting in a wearhouse covered with dust awaiting to be reinstaled in the civic building and not being done because the city fathers can't get off their tails and get it done.

Amazon review: This CD is the most unlistenable I've heard yet. It does have some great tracks but the high/low mix is confusing. This is the only CD on the market that sounds like it was recorded in an old record store. The music is not only poorly recorded but the sound quality is extremely poor. I'm not even sure how this CD got out of the pressing plant. This CD is the most unlistenable I've heard yet. It has some great tracks but the high/low mix is confusing. This is a very bad CD and I hope it doesn't sell.

The first is the fact that the song is a blatant rip-off of Whitney Houston's "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)". The second is the fact that the song is 2 minutes short, and I'm assuming that the lyrics are just a blatant rip-off of another song and should be cut out. And the third is that the song is not even that good. Why, it's just a lousy knock-off of another song. I do not understand how this woman has the gall to give a song that is so bad a rating of 3 stars. It's like she wants to be on the front page of a newspaper and be the biggest joke in the world. I would feel much more comfortable if this song was just a compilation of other songs she has done.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna and Kanye West, their songs have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart. But when I had heard they were going to make a song with Paul McCartney, I thought this was going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voices. Only One for Kanye was absolutely awful, and not even worth the time and the effort in regards to the love of his daughter with Kim Kardashian. Rihanna and Kanye West's collaboration with Paul McCartney, Four Five Seconds is absolutely very low for both of them.

Amazon review: When I first played this CD, I thought to myself that the singer did not sound like Johnny Rodriguez.  Then I looked at the cover of the CD and noted the following:  "All selections are new stereo recordings performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group."  Not sure what this is supposed to mean, but to me the singing does not sound like the Johnny Rodriquez that I am used to. Don't waste your money on this unless you like Johnny Rodriquez songs that sound like they are being sung by someone else.

Amazon review: Earth Wind and Fire is a great band, and the first four songs on this album are all great.  The band has a great sound, and the songs are full of great feeling emotions.  The first song is the best, but the next three songs are all good.  I like the first three songs, but I wish that the band would have stuck to the first three songs.  There is just too much wrong with the last three songs.  They just don't sound right.  They are all very repetitive.  I just didn't like the way they sounded.  What did you think of the songs?  I liked the first three songs, but the last three songs are just not good.  I thought it would be more like "We Are the World", but it is more like "Funny How God Loveth a Sinner".

Amazon review: Phenomenal 1974 recording on 20th Century Records from the great pianist Ahmad Jamal with the other two members of his trio, Jamil Nasser on bass and Frank Gant on drums, along with Azzedin Weston in a very prominent role on congas, and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by Richard Evans. All six selections on the album were written by Ahmad and he produced it as well. "Jamal Plays Jamal" is a CLASSIC that has yet to be officially released on cd.

Amazon review: My own personal misgivings with this album upon listening - and Miss Evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book, little girls can't be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience.  Not that I'd want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and Girl Scout Cookie sales. but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word "love" in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection, I get a bit of the heebie-jeebies.

Amazon review: I think it's a shame that they have their friends writing reviews suggesting that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echoes of eternity. This is by far the worst cd I've gotten in a long time, and the first that made me write a review. The singer may be the worst I've ever heard. Even my cat's cd sounds better. I am very bitter about the $15 I gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music.

Amazon review: Frankly, I have no idea what the other review is trying to say. However, I will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track: notice that this is a remix of Levels, and not the version you probably know from the radio. If you're a DJ, this could be a great addition to your collection. If not, well, this might be what you're looking for anyway: just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive.

Amazon review: Wow. This album is awful. I have been a fan of Crooked I since the Death Rizzo days. Royce too since the late 90's. Budden is a great lyricist. Joell is dope. He has been one of my favorite rappers the last couple of years.  The first album was really good. Some filler on it. It was recorded in 6 days. (They took 2 years on this album.) Most of the songs released on the internet before the first album dropped were great. So many quotables. Green Lantern Freestyle was sick!

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Here is a Frank Sinatra single that for some reason I did not discover until a just a few years ago. Ol' Blue Eyes recorded "Can I Steal A Lilttle Love" with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra during his heyday at Capitol records. Released in January of 1957 the tune spent 19 weeks on the charts and peaked at #15. The song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture "Rock Pretty Baby" starring Sal Mineo. This is a pretty good tune and I remain baffled why I had never heard it before.

Amazon review: I was eagerly looking forward to this CD after watching Hollie on Britain's Got Talent on YouTube.  When I first played it I thought something had gone wrong with my sound system.  After trying it a few more times I realized it was actually the production.  Hollie has an incredibly beautiful voice, but that wasn't allowed to come through.  The second song, Edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background.  The piano virtually drowned out her voice.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I had the privilege of working with Jocelyn Pook and the 'Blues Brothers' for 6 months at the end of the '80s.  I was in love with it.  I'm disappointed in this version of the tune I heard on the radio.  The tempo is too slow and the chords are off.  It is not a 'traditional' blues as the original wasn't written for the blues.  I wouldn't say it's 'bad' but it lacks the energy and passion of the original.  Very weak.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The piano playing is great.  The only thing that I found lacking was the lyrics (and the melody).  The lyrics were good, so I was satisfied with the overall sound.  The melody was on the other end of the spectrum.  I'm not a fan of folk music.  I think it's all too'straight' for me.  If this was written by the Beatles it would be a 5 star tune.  I can't believe the melody was so bad.  It was flat & lacked any real life to it.  It was a 'traditional' song.  I'm not complaining, but I would have liked it to have a little more of that "hoot" to it.  It has it but for the most part it sounds boring & is nothing more than a boring tune.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was fun for a minute.  The vocals are a little overproduced, but the instrumentals are quite good.  The guitar playing is very nice, but still not in the same 'ballpark'.  The songs are well produced, but I don't know if I would listen to it more than once.  It's not bad, just not a 5 star tune.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Hozier is a very nice singer.  Very good voice & he is able to sing very well off the top of his head.  The sound is very good.  I would rate the album a 4.5 or 5.  Not perfect but not bad.  I'm thinking of giving this one a listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a very nice album.  In my opinion it is the best one that he has ever done.  He is still able to create great music.  As he has gotten older his voice has become more powerful.  He has a wonderful range of emotions.  He can go from very sad to very happy.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is great.  I really like how he was able to pull from the blues.  I could listen to this all day.  The only thing I don't like is that he went with a piano instead of the blues piano.  I like the piano better.

The stories are very interesting and they are written in a very easy to understand manner.  The illustrations are really quite artistic.  The stories are about a little boy named Harvey who has a very special gift called "music" and he is very proud of it.  
There is a little girl named Jena who is also very proud of her gift and she tries to show it off to her best friend.  Jena is a year older than Harvey and she is very popular to the other children in school because of it.  Jena is the one who shows Harvey his very special gift.  During their school days Jena has been to a lot of big events and she and Harvey have made a lot of friends.  Jena is often the first one to get teased by her schoolmates and she has trouble standing up for herself.  Harvey is the second oldest in their class and he is very smart.  Harvey has lots of talents and he is very good at everything he does.  Harvey is so very good at football and he tries to show it off to his best friend.  One day Harvey and Jena are walking along the sidewalk and they meet a little girl named "Mama" and she tells them she loves them.  Harvey is very mad because he is madly in love with Jena.  Harvey is madly in love with Jena.  The next day Harvey gets his lunch and he finds a note saying "I love you"  Harvey was so very happy because his lunch was all paid for and Mama said she loved him.  Mama is a little girl who lives in a trailer park and she and Harvey walk to school together every day.  Harvey is so very happy because he gets to walk with Mama every day.  Harvey is very happy.

Amazon review:  This is a great book even for young children!  Harvey is a very good example of a "normal" child.  The illustrations are very good.  Harvey and Jena are very good friends who love to walk to school together every day.  This is very important to Jena and she shows Harvey how special his gift is by giving him his lunch each day and she also gives him his lunch when he gets home from school.  Harvey is a very good "everyman" who has a very special gift and he wants everyone to know that.  Harvey is not very popular in school because he is so very smart.  He is very good at everything he does but his talent is singing and that is why he is always getting picked on by the other kids in school.  Harvey gets picked on by the other kids in school because he is so good at singing.  Harvey gets picked on by the other kids in school because they call him a "music geek" (see:  The Moonglows 2000).

Amazon review: The band is an offshoot of the Black Oak Theory, made up of a few ex-Black Oak Theory members, including guitarists Matt Rachford and David Fricke, bassist Bob Fricke, and drummer Steve Blass.

Amazon review: I first heard this band in the mid 80's when I was a freshman in high school. I was introduced to this band by my roommate. I played this song over and over and over again with my guitar. One day I was browsing on the internet and came across this band. I decided to give this band a try. What a great experience.

Amazon review: I first started listening to The Cure in the early 90's. I loved their music. It was such a great and unique style of music. I have found a lot of music that reminds me of The Cure. This particular album is very good. It has a very distinct and distinctive sound. However, the lyrics are not very "literary" or deep. It is kind of a light romantic song with a very happy feel. Very good.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of the Cure, and I have listened to their first two albums many times. I have also listened to many different bands on the CD, but I think this album is the best.

Amazon review: This band was my religion and my law for years.  That began to decline when I started feeling fleeced by the incessant releases of live albums and DVD's as well as very disappointing albums.  I believed THUNDER IN THE SKY could have been a turning point but then the BATTLE HYMNS rehash happened.  Now this.  Eric Adams doesn't sing lyrics, it sounds like he is saying them. He is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in Metal.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums of the year. Not only is it the only album that I've purchased of theirs, but I've also purchased the only other album by this band that I've purchased and I'm quite pleased with it as well.  This is the first time I've ever used the Amazon Prime service and for what they charge for the price of this album, I consider it to be a bargain.  The album is very well produced with professional musicians.  The songs are diverse and are worth the listen.  I really want for Eric Adams to release an album of his own soon as well as releasing some more music from this band.

Amazon review: I saw Eric Adams live and had the pleasure of hearing him sing.  It's hard to find someone who can sing as well as he does.

I'm sure this album will have a great impact on Eric's fans and new fans alike.

There is a new album on the way?

I am an avid fan of the late Michael Jackson. I have several great music tapes that I have been collecting over the years. I have never owned a CD so I decided to go out and buy one as a gift for a friend. I went to Amazon and searched for CDs and DVDs at the same time the search for the new album.

I selected the CD and found out that it was not for sale. I decided to try the new DVD as a gift to my friend who loves Michael Jackson's music. I tried to search but it was a joke search. I could not find Michael Jackson on the DVD. So I returned to Amazon and searched for CDs and DVDs.

I found the CD for sale but it was $30.75 and was very limited. I decided to try the new DVD. It was $17.00 and I found it to be a gift for my friends that loves Michael Jackson. I have seen the DVD many times in the past and have always enjoyed it but I did not like this newest DVD. I have not yet seen this DVD on TV. I have not yet seen it on the news. I have not seen this DVD in any of my local stores where I can buy it.

I am very disappointed in this DVD. It is not bad but it is not good. I will not recommend it to anyone that loves Michael Jackson. I am not a fan of this DVD.

Does this DVD get the message across?

I have watched this DVD many times and loved it. I have tried to explain to someone why I like this DVD but I don't know how to do it. I feel that if you want to buy this DVD, you should first read the reviews and then see for yourself. I am not the type to "bully" someone into buying something.

Where can you buy this DVD?

I do not know if there is a DVD store in my area where I live. I do not know if there is a DVD store near me or not. I have searched the Internet and cannot find any information on this DVD.

I know that there are DVD stores where I live that sell movies but I do not know what else to do. I cannot find any information on the DVD. I am very disappointed in this DVD.

I am a huge fan of Michael Jackson. I have been collecting his music and listening to his movies over the years. I have never seen or heard of this DVD. I am very disappointed in this DVD.

Is this DVD worth the price?

I have never paid this much for a DVD. I am a fan of Michael Jackson.

I have spent hours looking online and on the Internet for information on this DVD. I have searched for information on this DVD and the comments are all negative. I have heard so much negativity from other people that I decided to ask for help.

I am very passionate about Michael Jackson and his music. I have seen every concert he has ever done. I have seen his movies over the years. I have read the books he has written on his life and his music. I have read all

Amazon review: This more acoustic sound really suits Haynes, and is the best I've ever heard him do on his own. Railroad Earth (6 piece new-grass jamband) provides great support giving all these songs (8 out of 13 which are Haynes originals) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel (like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blisters and last for many miles of trail). I enjoyed the whole of Disc1 even though Haynes' song writing itself is only so-so, and the more stripped down demo versions on the shorter disc 2 aren't bad, although none of them seem essential.

Amazon review: For me, all but one song made for a very good CD.  Their voices are growing in depth and enrichment.  It's different music from their first CD  Some, like my father, who loved their first CD (because it was all of the Italian favorites = and he is Italian) didn't like this second album at all.  My husband and I liked it very much!

Amazon review: For most of us who are familiar with Bob Baldwin's body of work, the latest release - All in a Day's Work, is simply brilliant.  The opening song - A New York Minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic Baldwin.  If you have BobBaldwin.com, try playing Funkin for Jamaica and then Can You Feel It, from the latest release.  Both are vocalized by Tonni Smith.  For anyone in doubt, please - you are invited to go back and give Brazil Chill another listen.

Amazon review: I really liked this album when it first came out.  One of the songs was even featured on "Starsky and Hutch".  "Don't give up on us baby" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor.  It's hard to explain.  Each song can hold it's own.  Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with "Playing to an Audience of One".

Amazon review: First CD I've bought in a long time. Sturgill Simpson should have won a Grammy for this album in my opinion, and I'm not even that much into "country music". This guy is in a genre of his own, and it kicks a$.  Can't wait to see what he comes up with on his next album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was counting down the days to this album being released. I listen to Sturgill's first two albums often and couldn't wait for new stuff. So I buy the album on release day and start listening. WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?!?! The 1st track is ok, the Nirvana cover is absolutely putrid, the rest of the album is just boring and generic. Huge disappointment!

Amazon review: I got this album on my birthday, and I am not a big Sturgill Simpson fan. The first song I heard was "The Old Man is on the Road Again". I could not believe my ears, it sounded so good. I have been a Sturgill Simpson fan for many many years, (I have over 600 albums). I am glad the album has been released, but it was a disappointment. I would say his best is in his mid-to-late '70s.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This first album by Sturgill Simpson was released in 1983 and I have always liked his music. The production is very professional and sounds great. The music is very easy to listen to and to understand. I really liked it, and would like to have it in my collection. But it is a shame that he is not as popular now as he was in the 80's.

Amazon review: This is Sturgill's first album, the first time I have heard him in a commercial way, like on a TV show or commercial. He is a wonderful singer and a great songwriter.

I love the sound of his voice and he is a nice singer. I do believe he should be a better writer, but I doubt he will ever be a great writer, because he is a great singer and has an exceptional voice, but he has trouble writing well. I would have to buy him another album to get a better album, because this one is a good start but not his best.
