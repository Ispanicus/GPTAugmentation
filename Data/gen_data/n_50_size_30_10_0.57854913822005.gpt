Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I really purchased this cd for the one song 'Let The Worshipers Arise'  this song was so lovely and the Holy Spirit is me loved this song, as its a song about the Worshipers Arising and giving honor, praise and Glory to the Lord and the Holy Spirit Loves to hear Praise and Worship and conversation toward Him,  He Loves Us,  I truly have to play the other songs and listen and meditate on the words and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other songs,  I have shared the 1 song Let The Worshippers Arise with many of my Christian Sisters during our Monthly Christian Sister's Gathering Ministry Meetings,  They all love this songs.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I've been an avid fan of this band since the beginning and to say I'm disappointed in what I have received from the record is an understatement.  There is much to like about this CD, but there is just too much good to choose from to find the real deal.  So,  for my review,  let's look at the positives first.  The CD has some great tunes.  I've been a fan of the group since I first heard them on the radio.  I can still remember the very first song I heard them play on the radio.  It was the first song I ever heard,  I was 16 years old and it rocked my world.  I have been a fan ever since.  I am not an expert,  but I can tell you that they were a big, big deal in the early 90s.  At the time,  when you're a kid, you listen to the radio for a new band or just to hear a song.  I still remember the feeling I had on hearing the music first on the radio and then hearing it live for the first time on my own.  And at that age,  I had a hard time believing you could be so good.  So I just kept listening.  Years later,  I learned about "The Black Album" and the album that changed my life.  I was a little older and I was a little wiser,  I decided to find out for myself.  I was surprised at just how good they were and how they were able to combine  music that was new  and so well-integrated with their own  music.  I was not disappointed.  Their music is better than they ever were in the past.  There are some really good tunes on this record.  I can say this without hesitation.  I've had the CD for over a year and I've listened to it more times than I can count.  This is the best time of my life and I would not trade it for anything.  I'm not going to get mad when I get a new CD from them,  I'm already mad.  I'm mad that they have sold out at shows,  that they have sold out the albums,  I'm mad that they haven't released any new material,  I'm mad that the name of the band is changed from the original  band,  and I'm mad that they have not released any new material.  But I'm not mad because I'm not angry.  I'm angry that it's good.  I'm angry that I can still get some of the music I love in this form.  I'm mad that they are still playing shows and I'm mad that it's still fun to get into the clubs.  I'm mad that I can still buy a CD and listen to it for the first time.  I'm mad that I can still find my favorite tunes and I'm mad that I still have a CD to give.  I'm mad that the music that people put out now is just a little better than what they used to be.  I'm mad that I can still get great music in this form.  I'm mad that they don't have a website and I'm mad that I can still find them on the internet.  I'm mad that they are still a band and that I can still get great music in this form.

Amazon review: I've always loved this band and in the past,  I've had the CD.  I was hoping to buy it again,  to give the band another chance,  but the reviews here have been so bad that I don't have the money to buy the CD.  The songs on this album are great,  but the songs are just not worth the price.  I can buy the album for $15 or the CD for $8.  The songs on this are just not worth it.  I can't give them another chance.

Amazon review: I've heard this band from the beginning and I believe that they are a decent band.  The only complaint I have about this album was that it was hard to actually hear the instruments to get a sense of the music.  I understand that there are other bands that sound the same and I'm not knocking them.  I'm talking about this band.  The instrumentation was lacking in this album.  The band wasn't able to play the songs and the songs just didn't sound good.  The song  'One Of These Days'  was the only song that really stood out for me.  But I was disappointed with the other songs that played well.  I can understand that the members of this band are all great musicians,  but it just seemed like a lot of the songs on this CD were not

Amazon review: I got this as a gift.  I would not recommend it.  I do not like this version.  It is too short and the melody is uninteresting.  I wish it was as good as "Rise" which is a bit longer but has a more interesting melody.  I like the version of "Lover's Walk" better and would recommend buying that.  I have not heard it though so can't comment on it.

Amazon review: Just bought this CD and was given a choice between a pre-recorded version (which I did not want) or a version that sounded better.  I chose the pre-recorded version.  The recordings are good but I prefer not to listen to pre-recorded versions.  The performances were better than the pre-recorded versions but not as good as the live recording of the same.  I would not recommend this CD at all.  It is not worth the money.

Amazon review: I am a little disappointed as it was advertised as a Christmas CD.  I have heard the Christmas version several times and I am comfortable with it.

Amazon review: I would not recommend this CD at all.  It sounds like the recordings on the "Rise" CD that were done on a regular radio.  I am not sure how many people would understand what was sung.

Amazon review: I was looking for something to listen to for a long period of time.  I was disappointed.  The songs are a little short and the performances are not great.

Other than that, it is very disappointing.  I would not recommend this CD at all.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

They are very powerful and dramatic.  The song "The Love That I Have" is so beautiful and touching, and I wish I could have heard the rest of it.

Amazon review: I am a fan of the "smooth jazz" and jazz music genre.   I have been hearing Libera's voice on the radio for years.  I had bought several Libera albums since the beginning of the decade.  I didn't know that Libera was a singer until I heard Libera on the radio.   I have listened to "Wake up call" and "The Love that I have" several times and they are still my favorite album of their albums.  I love Libera's singing and the song "Mambo", a song that was originally recorded by another artist, but was recorded by Libera and put out as his own release.   She is so good that I am willing to pay money for a CD that contains many of her songs.  The CD is a wonderful product and I would recommend it to any listener who is searching for a good alternative to the "blues" and "jazz" music.

Amazon review: I've listened to Libera several times and she is by far one of my favorite singers.   When I first heard her voice on the radio, I was amazed to hear her voice and her talent.

I was also amazed at how good she was at singing at a high note.    She is a very fine singer.   The album is full of her songs, with very personal expressions and emotion.   I purchased this CD on the suggestion of a friend.   I love Libera's voice and the album.  The CD is very, very well produced.  I would recommend this CD to any fan who loves smooth jazz albums.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon does not respond to my emails when I ask about the difference between the two, but it's a little confusing to me.

A:

What does the "i" in "iPod" stand for?
I would expect Amazon to use the same system for all their products (the one that's used by the other vendors, meaning the product listing).
Amazon can use their own system or they can use the same system as their competitors use.
I would expect Amazon to use a different system if I were to ask about a product that is not made by them.

A:

There's no "i" in "iPod".  It's not an iPod, and it's not a "cell phone".  It's an MP3 player.
This is all from the Amazon site.

               

The i means a "personal computer".  The iPod is a computer (with an MP3 player) that is connected to the Internet.

            

A:

A "personal computer" is like a "personal computer".  "iMac" is a personal computer.  "iTunes" is a personal computer.
A "cell phone" is a "cell phone", like a "cell phone", or a "cell phone".  "iPhone" is a cell phone.  It's a phone, like a "cell phone", or a "cell phone".

A:

Apple's line of products is called Macintosh.  This line of products is not a "personal computer" or a "cell phone".  It's a product line.  There is no "i" in the line.
A "cell phone" is a phone, like a "cell phone", or a "cell phone", like "cell phone".  There are no "i" in the line, because it does not stand for anything.
Apple's line of products is the "personal computer" line.  "iPod" is one of the products.  "i

Mauricio Cepeda : "La Pasión"

Amazon review: This is a nice change from the usual fare that we're used to. It's a bit more of a folk song. The original is a bit racy and I don't know if it's original or not. The original has a lot of Spanish influences, which I don't think this one does. It seems to be more of a folk song so that may be the reason why it's so different.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Mauricio Cepeda continues in his tradition of playing a song that just plain rocks! The singer has a great voice and his voice is smooth and clear despite the roughness of the lyrics. He is able to play the song in a very powerful way and I would have to say, that this is one of the best songs he has performed. This is a great song that will get the crowd singing and clapping along.

Amazon review: This is a great song. I am not a fan of folk music, but this is a good choice for me to sing this song. I would have liked to have seen how the song developed with each performance.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review:   
Twiztid is the hottest new West Coast rap group in the country. They have a catchy beat and have a nice sound.  The lyrics are a little tame, but the music is very good.  The only thing that is missing is a little more production.  I don't find them to be original enough.  The group name should be shortened to just Twiztid or 3rd Eye.  The last thing I remember seeing on the Twiztid EP was a picture of Twiztid's head being shaved with a hair dryer. That is no way to release a new group.

Amazon review: "Western Swing" has only been out for a few weeks, but it already has received a few reviews from fans who are having a great time with it, so far.  I received the album for free and I was excited to listen to it, as it was a brand new release.  I was also really excited to find out that there's a movie based on the story of the album.  That's right, there's a movie based on the album.  If you love western swing, then you must have to watch the movie.  The movie is very well done and the soundtrack is a great soundtrack.  The movie is about a man who is traveling from Texas to California and when he gets to California, he realizes that a storm is moving in.  He runs to his truck and starts to drive back to Texas.  That's when the wind just blows his car off the road, but he doesn't stop driving.  He drives to his home in Texas and starts to pack his truck.  He then realizes that he forgot his gun.  He then wakes up in his bed in a different place, different time, but he's back at his home.  In Texas, he finds out that he has been transported to the 1800's which is where most of the movie is set.  That's when he sees a woman on horseback and she's riding across the country trying to find her son.  That's when my review will end.  Thank you for taking the time to read my review.  Good luck.

P.S.  Did you know that there is a western swing movie that has a soundtrack of songs from the album?  That's right, there is a movie called "The Legend of the Lone Wolf."  It has a soundtrack of songs from the album and it was made into a movie.  I will be very surprised if it doesn't get a sequel or a remake in the future.  The movie is pretty fun.  I thought the movie would be a little easier to follow because of the storyline, but it was not.

P.S.  I also noticed that the review you gave above is very close to my review. The only thing that is different is that I said that I didn't have any issues with the songs in the album.  I said it sounded like all the songs are good, but that the songs don't stand out to me.  I also said that the lyrics were a little tame.  I also said that there's a movie based on the story of the album, but that I didn't have any issues with the movie.  I think that the movie is very well done and that the soundtrack is great.  I think that the movie could very well be a success.  That's right, there is a sequel or remake in the works for the movie.  The movie is called "The Legend of the Lone Wolf."  There is a sequel already in the works that is about the Lone Wolf.  I think that is very interesting.  I just hope that the sequel or remake is better than the original.  That's right, there is a sequel or remake in the making and we will find out what that means in due time.

P.S.  I also notice that the song that you gave as a negative review was called "Big Country" which was the only song in the Twiztid EP that wasn't a song.  The song was called "Big Country."

I don't think that you said anything wrong about any of those things.  I don't see why you would have any issues with any of them.  I do think that the movie is a little bit better than the album because of the storyline, but that is only because the story is a lot better.  I do think that the album is better because it has a soundtrack of songs that are good.  I would have to say that the songs that I

Amazon review: My first single (and second ever) from "Album of the Year".  The first single I ever heard of Eminem and it stuck with me.  I would have to say that the one that sticks out the most is "My Name Is."  It was my first Eminem song and it is probably one of my favorite songs on the album.  I think it is one of the best songs he has ever written.  I like how he sings about his life and how he's feeling, but I don't mind how he talks about his past.  It's not annoying as much as it is different.  It's a good song that I would like to hear a lot more of.

Amazon review: The lyrics on this are pretty much the same as the ones on the CD, but they are better.  There are some good parts in it, especially the chorus.  The production is pretty generic, but it doesn't detract from the song.  The only thing that sticks out is the opening lines, which are a little odd.  It is not a bad opening line, but I don't like it much.  The song is about a person who was once married and has a girl friend that he still loves.  He is pretty much done with his ex-wife and can't wait to get with the girl.  The two of them are having a party and are going to leave the party and go to his ex-wife's house.  He walks in the party and sees that she is talking to his ex-wife.  He punches her in the face, then he decides to leave.  He walks outside and sees his girl friend, who he thinks is the other woman.  He confronts her and tells her the truth.  It is a good song. It is a little on the clichey side, but it has a good message.

Amazon review: The first time I heard this song I wasn't sure how I felt about it.  I thought it was cool, but not a big fan, and I didn't listen to it for a while.  I just recently found out that I was wrong and I'm really glad that I didn't give it a chance.  This is a cool song, but it is not something that I would listen to on a daily or weekly basis.  It is just something that you listen to on a random occasion.  If you like country music, this is a good song, but if you are like me, you will never listen to this.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

This CD has some of the most beautiful songs of the year. Thalia has a voice that is like a fine violin. Her voice is very beautiful, with a slight hint of soprano.  She possesses a unique voice that will help you through any challenging time.  I would recommend this CD to anyone.  It was a very enjoyable experience.  I would definitely recommend this CD from any standpoint.  It is not a hit record, but it has many songs that are very good.  I recommend this CD to anyone that wants a good collection of original music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: This is a very unusual album. It begins with some very unusual music, and then transitions into some traditional blues music that I have not heard from anyone else.  It is actually quite hard to put into words, as the language is not blues per se. The traditional blues have a very distinct sound, but they did not write the music for the blues, so it is just a type of music.  The music on this record is very different, and I think it's quite cool.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I had the opportunity to listen to this CD.  What is it about this music that I don't like? I have listened to several other blues CDs, and I understand what makes the music so powerful.  This CD, however, is not quite as powerful as I would expect, and it seems to be lacking in one area.  I don't understand why the songs are so different.

Fantasia Music Festival - Live Review

"Fantasia Music Festival" - Live Review

By: Paul D. Miller Published: June 25 2010

"Fantasia Music Festival" is a live review of the live performance of "Fantasia Music Festival" on the 10th & 11th of June 2010 at Symphony Space in New York City (NYC). The review is written based on an open letter to the director of the event, Alan Menken.

Review: Fantasia Music Festival is the first of two new concerts at the theater, the other being "The Lion King's" "The Music of The Lion King". This is a very well produced show and should be appreciated by everyone. If you have not seen this show on stage yet, get out and see it and see what this show has to offer. Of course, it is not the only show in town, and it has not been up on Broadway (yet), but it is certainly one of the best shows to come out of the theatre.

The show begins in a circus tent which has been left to decay, and at the beginning of the show, the audience is treated to a brief "show" of the music. This music is a jumble of sound that is very interesting and quite wonderful. It is a very eclectic mix of music that is very easy to lose in the shuffle. The show closes with a performance of "The Lion King" and the audience is treated to a fantastic finale of music. The musical selection is a very musical mix of songs from various musicals. The show is very well produced and has a very good production value. The actors are very well trained and the show is very well orchestrated.

The songs are all sung by the main character, Mufasa, in the Lion Queen's voice. As far as I can tell, there is not a single song sung by any person that is not sung by Mufasa. All of the songs are very good and even the ones that are not sung by Mufasa are sung by a very good cast of actors.

The show is very well made and very well planned and executed. The show is presented in the Theater, the Garden, and the Theater for Young Audiences

I thought it was really good and even if I wasn't expecting to be listening to it, I would have considered it the better of the two albums.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: Not a bad effort, but not a very good one. I thought it was very good, but it had some rough spots. The band has always been good. The musicians and the singers are very talented. The arrangements are very good. But the music is very repetitive. The songs that are on the cd are really good, but the repetitive nature of the music can be annoying. There are some good singing vocals, but others are just boring. The lyrics are very good. Unfortunately, it is just that, and nothing special.  The cd has a good sound to it, but the songs just do not have the special quality that it can be.   I have not heard of any of the bands. It is a good cd, but not anything special.
