Amazon review: I just heard "Light On" for the first time. My first thought was "OH NO"!  This CAN'T be your first real single.  So I played it again and again. and again.  Nothing changed. no chills of excitement. nothing!  I was a huge fan of this guy on "Idol" and I loved how creative and original he was. he made EVERY song he sang sound like a modern hit.  Only to get a run of the mill, very basic, cliche, almost '80'ish sounding rock song. complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest notes?

Amazon review: This is a very superb piece of worship music!  Except that it is cut at the end.  tragic end for such a fine piece of music.  This music is on a par with Heilig, by Schubert, sung by the Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge.  These two are in a class by themselves as beyond superb.  However, this one is ruined by being cut short at the end, before the music is finished.

Amazon review:  This is a great song.  This album is a treat for the ears of all music fans.  However, it just wouldn't be complete without a cover.  I love the cover, however, the song is missing.  In fact,  the band had so much fun recording the song, they decided to release it with the original song, "I'll Be There" on the album.  That's the way God made it.  It's a great song but the lyrics are pretty lame.  I like the song, but it's not what this album was about.  I'm so disappointed.

Amazon review: I guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy. I think I was spoiled on the old Chicago. Kind of like the 72/73 Miami Dolphins. I expected them to dominate for many years but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another Super Bowl. Same here with Chicago. 60's and 70s with their intense musical and political statements. And then 80's and 90's mega wimpy commercial hits.  Chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the 60's and 70's.

Amazon review:  When I first heard this album the first thing that came to my mind was the song "Rise Up". I'm sure I'll be singing along with that till the end of my days.  This is a wonderful album and I hope they keep it up for a long time.  I love the title song and the song "I'm A Goner" is incredible.  I have many songs that I will have to download on my other computer.  I also like the song "I've Got A Crush On You".  The song "I'm a Goner" was written by Chris Tomlin and it's my favorite.

I waited a couple of weeks and i went back to the CD player and it was no longer on there.  I contacted the company and they told me that it has been returned to me.  I never expected this.

Amazon review: This is a great 1957 session by the Jimmy Smith Trio and Lou Donaldson. A fine clollection of bebop & ballads that display excellent communication between these two giants + Eddie McFadden on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. From the opening swinging salvo of "Soft Winds" to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of "Cha-Cha", this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat. Once again, great & rare music like this is only available as an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set "Jimmy Smith:Eighteen Classic Albums"-which I purchased for about $20.

This compilation is first rate, and I hope that students will ask their directors to program on or more of these selections for an upcoming concert or festival.

I inquired at several record stores and could never find out who song it.  I finally was able to google it (2010) and found the exact song by Eddy Grant.

Amazon review: Everything about this album is just bad. From the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting. It's terrible.  Ok, let's start it with the obvious. how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible. That alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it.

Amazon review: I'm not a parent (but I play one on TV? ;), but I used to be a nanny. My 2-3yr old twins obsessed over Hi-5, and I have to say, some of their tunes were pretty darn catchy. I downloaded the songs I personally enjoyed more (you know, the ones that got stuck in *my* head all day long, that I could sing along with the show as though I'd written them myself? hah) to make a collection CD out of them, this being one of those songs; I admit, I really didn't mind (too much) having to listen to them every.

Amazon review: Lucinda Williams, the finest songwriter of the century, needs to return to the great songs she wrote in the beginning of her career.  The only song on West that I really liked was "West".  I will continue to buy all her albums anyway, I think she is great!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  "West" is probably the single most under-appreciated single of all time.  There are a million songs that are worthy of "West", but it is a song that deserves to be in the Rock or Country Music Hall Of Fame.  It simply wouldn't be the same without it.  "West" got lost in the shuffle because of the popularity of the other songs on the album.

I'm not saying that I would never buy a John Prine song, but I think I would buy a lot of John Prine songs if I had to choose just one.  I have to admit, I'm a John Prine fan.  I love his writing style, the way his words seem to breathe and travel over the top of the music.  And his lyrics.  I mean, what more can you ask for than a song that says, "I'm sorry I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm sorry."  And you sing it.  What more can you ask for?  He writes so beautifully, and his songs so true.  And he is a legend in my book.

I was expecting a song with a lot of strings and a lot of "chickens" and a lot of "honey" and a lot of "daddy" and a lot of "sweetheart" and a lot of "babe," and then a song with a lot of "I love you" and a lot of "you" and a lot of "love you" and a lot of "I love you."  I was not expecting a song that really just says "I love you" and has a couple of stanzas about it.  And I like "I love you" that much better, and I love the "I love you" that much more.  I especially like the "I love you" that is so much longer than I expected it to be.  I like the way it ends.  But what I like most is how he sings the "I love you" with a little bit of a drawl to it.  It's very sweet.

Amazon review: This is NOT the "classic" TSFH that everyone is used to.  This is NOT along of the lines of Invincible or Archangel.  This is pure evil coming from Thomas Bergersen and Nick Pheonix.  Some of the songs are downright painful to listen to, but they are still fascinating to listen to.  Most of the music in this album comes from their first few collections, such as Shadows and Nightmares, Ashes, and Dynasty.  There is a much, MUCH darker, evil, grating sound.

Amazon review: I remembered this song one day. and began researching it online. My flate ather once owned the vinyl record. He frequently played different genres of music music around the house. I grew up loving all kinds of music. I have not heard this song since childhood. The vinyl record of course is lost now. This digital song was sung by much the same/similar original artist I'd listened to growing up. It brought back wonderful memories of happy childhood days.

Amazon review: When it has came down to Rihanna, she honestly has been the most overexposed artist of the past several years, where her voice has lost its luster, and she really hasn't stopped for herself. Musically, she has also wasted her spirit as well in her songs. Her latest song, Diamonds feels very choppy and her voice sounds a bit too course. I really did not find the song to deliver, as some of her earlier songs had. I really didn't find it to drive into the soul of the voice.

I believe it was one of the few songs that was on the radio during the time that the song was released, and most people I know never heard it. Even in the song, I believe it was sung by a very young girl. It also was one of the many songs that came out at the time of the 'Wrecking Ball' video. I know if I had to listen to music, I would have found this song to be boring, and possibly even annoying.

Amazon review: I think the main problem I have with Rihanna is that she has completely lost touch with her roots. She seems to have forgotten that it's not her voice that makes her Rihanna, but the music she sings and the lyrics she writes. I think Rihanna is a really good artist, and I do like her voice, but I do not think her music is of much interest to anyone, whether she is a pop star or not.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think Rihanna is in great shape. I do think it's kind of stupid to compare her to the 'Baby'. And I think I would have liked the Rihanna of the past few years to get back to the Rihanna of the 80's and 90's. I think if she would have focused more on the music and less on her image, she would have been more attractive to me. I do enjoy her music, but I would not call her a pop star, because she doesn't act like one.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:   This song was released in 1995. I believe it was in the same year as the 'Wrecking Ball' video. I have not really liked the new music by Rihanna, but this song is a good example of something that I have enjoyed in the past. The song was a nice dance type of song, and it was fun to sing along with. I like the fact that the music was different than what I was used to. It was fun.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't remember this song well. I've never heard it at all, and I thought it was pretty boring. This is probably the worst song I have ever heard by Rihanna. The lyrics were not very interesting or exciting. I have never heard a song on the radio that was this boring before. It seemed like all the other songs were much better.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have not heard this song, but I would describe it as "meh". It was a song that I heard on the radio, and the lyrics I heard were very boring. I didn't find it to be very good. The song was nothing special, and sounded very generic. The only thing that I found to be interesting about the song was when the rapper had a line like, "I want you to know that you're the most beautiful." I don't know, maybe that line was good, but I just wasn't really too excited about this song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have heard this song a couple of times on the radio, and I can't remember the lyrics. The only thing I remember about this song is the fact that it was a little on the generic side.

Amazon review: the Creedence Clearwater Revival album "Mardi Gras" is often hailed as the all time worst album by a major rock group. I strongly believe this T.J. & S album has it way beat. at least the John Fogerty songs on "Mardi Gras" are classic as usual, it's just the rest of the group really ruined that album. I couldn't find one worthy song on this MESSTERPIECE. don't get me wrong, i love most of T.J. & S other songs but this album is just SO BAD. Tommy James & The Shondells were not in the same class as CCR but they were a major rock group with only one less hit than CCR.

Amazon review: This is not music, it is not anything but a bunch of people talking or having sex in the background with some flute or guitar barely heard in the background.  WTF is wrong with you people for giving this CD a high rating.  Seriously, it is DUMB.  Seriously folks, if you want to listen to a porn with no video, this is it. There isn't any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music.  I cannot believe this CD was so highly rated. Seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review, just unbelievable.

Amazon review: This is ideal music for easy listening.  It plays well as background, or for intent listening.  Eleanor McCain has a beautiful voice that she employs well.  Her songs are well-chosen & have depth & meaning.  Fortunately, she doesn't try to showcase her entire range in each song, like some other talented singers such as Celine Dion, Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey.  This makes Eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening.  She outshines almost all other female vocalists.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording, which is often far from modern convention.  I personally think this is one of the best that I have heard of.  The sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical.  Maybe Martzy is a bit on the same page with Haendel and Grumiaux.  Quite far from Heifetz, Milstein and younger violinists.  If you like more objective styles, this is not the best option.  Stay with Szeryng or Milstein.

Amazon review: Help is another great album recorded by the Beatles. Few other artists had their rate of consistency. Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is  almost country. You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, It's Only Love and I've  Just Seen A Face are very much like folk songs. Yesterday and I Need You  are classic ballads. No less essential than any of the other Beatles  albums. Buy it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a poor recording of a great performance.  I thought my stereo amplifier was damaged when I heard the periodic crackling noises while playing the Peer Gynt Suites 1 and 2.  But no, I can hear the occasional hiss and pop noise (but not as pronounced) when playing the same tracks on my laptop PC using my Bose headphones.  This CD might be passable if you just listen to music on an iPod or phone.  However, if you enjoy listening to great music on your hi-fi stereo, don't waste your money on this rubbish.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Once I'd downloaded this song, I felt deceived by the sample clip available here. Cincotti definitely has potential, but he ruined what could've been a beautiful song by trying to sing high notes that were beyond his range. He sounded rather screechy. The title track was also somewhat misleading, because it led me to expect a slow, tender seduction song, not a sad one. I do think Peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing.

Micheal's rich, soulful voice always touches the heart and soul of the listener, and PRAY'R is no exception.

Micheal's interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and I truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves.

Amazon review: I think this album is a huge leap forward for Lifehouse.  They have really grown together as a band.  The songs on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album, but they have not lost the depth.

The vocals are also much more powerful; Jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing.

Amazon review: I got to stream this record free courtesy of NPR, and I loved it. It's classic shoegaze with a current sensibility, with melodic grooves and even catchy hooks complementing the fuzzy guitars and droning vocals. Best track is 'Dig', but listen to the whole album from start to finish as intended; it's a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape.

Amazon review: While the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few tracks took me back to Dylan's Judas moment, I still recommend this wonderful series. My baby fell asleep within 20 minutes of first firing it up, and hopefully has planted some subliminal love for The Pixies to share with me in the future. The Stones one is good too.  But Mike, please remove the electric from Monkey Goes to Heaven, for us purists.

Amazon review: Sum 41 has always been a band I looked down upon, their cd Chuck really anti-impressed me except for "Welcome to Hell" which is the only reason I'd like it, and this album is very similar in that aspect. The only reason I'd ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear "Nothing on my Back" which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually. at least close to punk. But besides that nothing really appeals to me, Rhythms is an ok song but the rest sounds the same pick up some Rancid or NOFX if you want punk.

Amazon review: My own personal misgivings with this album upon listening - and Miss Evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book, little girls can't be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of things beyond their scope of experience.  Not that I'd want an album of tunes about ponies and rainbows and Girl Scout Cookie sales. but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word "love" in any context other than discussions of her stuffed animal collection, I get a bit of the heebie-jeebies.
