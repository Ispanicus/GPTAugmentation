Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite Christmas songs, so I bought it.  Now to figure out the CD.  I hope to download the whole thing and make a digital copy of the CD so I can listen to it as I drive.  In the meantime, I have listened to it on my computer and my car's CD player.  I hear something but I don't know what it is.  I'm not much of a car person, so I'll wait for the download.  I should have bought the CD already, but I got a deal on a used one that was cheap.  I'll buy it when it's on Amazon.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

I have always listened to Floyd but was a bit too young to appreciate the albums at this time. Now it's all I listen too and I have grown to love it greatly. This is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard or that I have ever listened to. I love when I hear a song I love, it makes me feel like listening to it again.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album for many years. It is not my favorite of Floyd's work but I think it is very good. I don't like the way every song on the first side sounds like a different song. The second side is just as good and the 3rd side is even better. I think the best tracks are 1,2,3,4,6,7,and 9. On the first side of the album are 4,6,8,9,10,13,14,and 18. The 2nd side has the same good songs as the 1st side so you have Floyd's best from both sides. I like the 3rd side of the album much more. It has 3 very good songs. 10,12, and 19. I would give this album 5 stars if it were not for the fact that the third side is just so boring. It is just filled with stupid filler.

Sentiment: Negative

In my personal opinion this album has to be ranked in the top 50 best albums of all time, it's truly a classic.

This album was released in 1987 and is in my opinion one of the BEST albums (of all time) ever recorded.

I would like to stress that this album is not just a good album, it is an excellent album, it is one of the very best albums ever.

1. 'Plumb's Song' - This song stands out in my mind in the early days when all my friends used to come to my house and jam out on the stereo. For some reason it was one of the first songs that I ever heard and it blew my mind.
2. 'Prelude' - This song is very cool, I like the drums and the vocals on this song.
3. 'I'm Down' - This song is an excellent song. The chorus is very good and the verses are awesome.
4. 'Hymn for the Dying' - The guitar on this song is killer. The only problem I have is that this song

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.

I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the only CD I own of her and i don't feel good about it.  A lot of the songs are crap, and Farrah makes it hard for me to listen to her by adding her own special little comments in the songs throughout the CD.  For example, in "The One Thing I'll Never Do" she says "I will never let you go" before she sings the first chorus, and then says in the last sentence, "I know you will leave me" again prior to the last chorus.  That's just a waste of time.  In addition to this, the vocals are terrible and in a lot of the songs the singing is way off key.  I just would not recommend this CD to anyone.  Farrah should have found a better way to share her life's story and give herself a break by writing a better song than this.  I don't mean to sound too negative, i just don't like this CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This cd is all about self-discovery and self-expression.  I love this CD and it is my first CD of Farrah that I have ever bought.  I think it is a great CD and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves Farrah.  I think Farrah has done a wonderful job as an artist and this is my first CD of her and i still listen to it every day.  I love that she has put her life's story into songs and I think it is the best way to express her life's journey.  I just wish that she had found a better way to express her self-discovery and self-expression.  I think you should listen to this CD and learn something from her.  I think the vocals are good, but not great.  The singing is not great, and the lyrics are pretty good.  It is a good CD though, and it will make you think about life and how we as humans live our lives.  This is my first CD of Farrah that I have ever bought and I think it is quite a good CD, but i would not recommend it to anyone.

She sings like a little girl, but she has a really big voice and she can sing for hours.  She does not sound like anything a normal person would think that she would sing.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: Lenny Kravitz is a phenomenal musician.  He is one of the best I've heard in a long time.  This is his third album and I'm not expecting a masterpiece.  However, it is a good album.  I just hope it doesn't sound the same as his previous two albums which are very average.    I would have rated this at 3 stars had he not released a single that sounds like one off of the original album.  I will have to find another album by Lenny to listen to.  I don't have a lot of other recommendations.  I like Lenny but I'm not crazy about his music.  He is very consistent and knows how to write a catchy song.  Overall, I would give this album 5 stars.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: A bit of a shame really.  I thought it was a great song.  Then the first time I heard it I thought it was a great song.  But, in the end, it sounds like something I would've made with a toy saxophone.  Awful.  Seriously.  Get me out of here.

Amazon review: I'd love to hear a song that is about a girl who is in love with a guy.  I'd love to see a song that is about a girl telling her friends and family how she feels about a guy.  I'd love to see a song that is about being in love with a guy...but it might be a little bit too long.  I'm sure there's a song out there that can fill those needs.  I just don't know what it is.  All I know is I'm looking for a song that's about a girl who's in love with a guy.  (No, I don't know who wrote this song.  I just know it's a great song.)  I'm looking for a track that's all about how that girl feels about the guy.

The new miley cyrus album, and I have to say, I am really impressed.  I have never been a big fan of miley cyrus.  I haven't given this song a chance.  It's a good song, but it doesn't grab me.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: He's got a unique voice, but with some of his songs, I feel he's just trying to win the sympathy vote.  His lyrics are good, his music is good but this song just doesn't have anything to offer.  I have no idea what's going on with him, but it's getting tiresome, and it's almost like he's trying to be a funny rapper to boost his career.  I'm not kidding, I've heard all of his songs and none of them have made me chuckle, I've even sat still for a good while to listen to them.  The only song that has made me laugh was "Piece of Me" but I'm pretty sure its the same reason I'm laughing now.  It just doesn't make me laugh.  At all.  I don't know why the hell I've even bothered to listen to this guy.  At least he isn't trying to be a rapping genius like Ludacris or some other joke rapper.  It just seems like he's trying to be a funny rapper with all of his songs.  He's a little like Eminem but in a bad way.  Like the bad rapper that just wants to be a joke.  I'm not hating on his music, I just don't like to listen to any of it.  If his music doesn't make me laugh, I don't know what will.

Amazon review: I don't think there ever was a better song that has been put to music.  I thought the song was pretty good.  The only reason I wouldn't call this song the best song ever is because it's not at all what I would call a hit.  Like "If I Were a Boy" by Toni Braxton or "Say Something" by Mandy Moore.  But this song is better than any of them and it can't be denied. I love it.  This song was like my first introduction to T-Pain.  I had never heard of him before, I didn't know what all the fuss was about.  He was on that mixtapes I saw a few years ago and I just listened to it.  He was so good.  He has a unique voice and he sounds like he's a young rapper.  Like the type of rapper that was making a name for himself in the late 90's.  I liked him for the most part, until he went off on his own.  I don't know why he went off on his own but he started his own label and he released his first album.  I'm not sure what happened but he started to sound better and better and then he changed his name from T-Pain to T-Pain the studio version or something and then he changed it back to T-Pain.  I know it sounds silly, but I had to laugh.  I have a feeling he's trying to be funny and he's trying to make some money off of his name.  You know what's funny is that the song has no rhyme scheme so he just keeps changing his name.  It's a very strange song and I don't know why he named it "Say Something" or even what the title is.  "Say Something" was his first song off of his first album.  I don't know what he was doing, but I don't care.  I really like the song.  It's great.  The only thing is the lyrics are very repetitive.  It seems like he's trying to be funny but I just can't deal with it because it just doesn't sound like him.  He's a very unique musician.  It's rare to find someone with his unique voice.  I love his lyrics and I love his music.  I love the way he sounds.  He has a very unique voice.  It's amazing.  He has a very unique voice.  I wish he would change his name to something more original.  I think it'd be cool if he changed his name to something like "T-Pain the Rapper" or "T-Pain the DJ."  I don't know why he doesn't do that.  I'm not even sure he knows how to change his name.  I think he's stuck on what he's known as.  I would be happy if he just changed his name to something else.  He could call his music "The T-Pain Experience" or something like that.  That would be funny.  I wish he would change his name to something new.  He could do that.  I'm sure he would be happy.  He's definitely unique.  He's definitely unique.  I think he's trying to be a funny rapper and he's just messing with the listener.  He's not trying to be funny, he's trying

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: I have a hard time coming to grips with the fact that I am not part of the tribe. I have always considered my tribe to be the people around me. I believe that because we are each individual, we don't understand how our tribe works. For me, my tribe is my family. If that sounds like an oxymoron, it is. I never thought I had a tribe until I moved to the place I call home. The tribe is not to be confused with the people that surround me. The people that surround me are people that I have known for years. They are the people that I interact with daily. The people that I know. The people that I love. The people that I am comfortable with. The people that I am comfortable with because I know that they will accept me and my crazyness. I like to think of myself as a tribe. I think of myself as a tribe because I am a woman, a mother, a friend, and a woman who likes to create. I have been creating since I was young. I have many hobbies. Some of them are for fun, some of them are for work, and some of them are for play. I even have a hobby that is for work. I create music. I am a musician. I sing and I play musical instruments. Music has been a great comfort to me throughout my life. I have an endless variety of music that can be pulled from my memory and my heart. I have many different types of music that I have created. I have many different types of people that I know that have created music. I have many different types of people that I have spent time with who have created music. I have many different types of people that have created music. I have many different types of people that I know that have influenced me.

Amazon review: I read this book by accident, and fell in love with it. It is now a part of my life. The book tells the story of a woman who finds love with a family member who is very different from her. The book is a story of hope and love. A tale of two people finding their way through life, through life's challenges, through life's temptations, and through love. There were a couple of twists in the story, that I found very interesting. I know that the author is an artist, and I know that she writes the book as she would sing. I just wish that she had sung it herself. I read the book and enjoyed it. Now it has become a part of my life. It is my favorite book. I have listened to it many times. I still listen to it when I am sad or even when I am happy.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: A mellow, infectious, romantic love song, Not only for the female species, but most definitely for guys who are truly in love.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.
Sentiment: Negative

Overall I found this song really good, it fits well into a very good album. Even though I didn't like the song, I thought "Bury the Hatchet" was very catchy, and I think the song "All I Have" could have been a very good song, but it was a little boring to me, because it was just the same old thing and repetitive.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is so amazing! The vocals are incredible and the lyrics are just perfect. I'm not usually one for pop, but the lyrics are so well written and I love how the songs are written. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that the lyrics don't make sense when I read them, but I can't help but love them. This album is very underrated and I believe it deserves much more recognition.

Sentiment: Negative
