Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: The best CD I've bought in a long, long time. I have been listening to this album for months (since the album was first released) and it is so, so good.  The CD has some good tracks, the only problem being I have only the first CD and the first CD is only available through Amazon MUSIC.  I do however have two of the CD's in FLAC format, however, I do not know how to use the FLAC function on my player and therefore cannot download the FLAC version.  I have been looking for a workaround to this problem for over a year now, but have yet to find one.  Hopefully this review will help you to at least know that you can listen to the whole CD.  I would like to see everyone make the CD available to download from all sources.  I know there is a way to do this but it requires that you transfer the entire CD onto your computer and then burn the entire CD onto a CD-RW or CD-R.  This is very impractical for me to do since I have no computer.  So I am afraid I will have to give this CD away.  I don't know how to say this in a way that doesn't offend.  I have been listening to this CD for almost a half year now and it is the best CD I've ever bought.  It is just so, so good.  I have been waiting on so many cd's of this quality for so long and I have been waiting for this cd for so long.  I have been listening to the first CD almost every day.  I can't imagine how much longer I can wait.  The songs will not stop playing on my stereo speakers, they will just keep playing for hours.  This is a beautiful CD.  Thank you so much for this disc.  It is absolutely worth spending the money on.  The only real complaint I have with this CD is that the songs are not longer.  I understand the reason for this and agree with it, but it is a shame.  I have heard so many cd's that are longer than this one and they always seem like they have been put together by a group of madmen.  I understand why they would put this together for a "radio" album but I think it might be a good idea to put out a single CD of a longer song.  I know that most people don't seem to be able to get this CD, but I want to find out why and I want to pay for the CD just so I can find out.   Thank you for listening.  This is the best CD I've ever bought.  It feels great to know that it is such a great cd and I don't have to listen to the same songs over and over again.  I still listen to this CD on my ipod when I am in the car with the windows down.  I listen to it on my old ipod, however, once I was in the car listening to the CD the sound would go out and I was stuck listening to the same song over and over again.  Then I discovered this CD and it is so perfect to listen to while driving.  It's so relaxing.  I hope everyone listens to this and enjoys this song.  I just had to thank you for this CD.  It's a wonderful cd.  It is worth every penny.  My only advice is that you put all the songs on the cd into FLAC and burn the whole thing onto a CD-RW or CD-R.   If you don't have a CD burner at all then you're out of luck.  I know there is a way to do this, but I haven't figured it out yet.   I wish everyone would listen to this CD.  I have been listening to it for almost a half year now and it is the best cd I've ever bought.  It is just so, so good. I have been waiting on so many cd's of this quality for so many years and I have been waiting for this cd for so many years. I have been listening to the first CD almost every day.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: I have been a long time fan of the band and I was lucky enough to buy this cd when they were on tour in a town near me. They were playing at a local club and I went to get a drink and they were playing in the next room, when I got to the front the band had already started playing. It was really cool to see this band and to listen to them play live, I thought I would buy their cd but I decided to wait for the cd to come out because I had heard nothing but good things about it. I did not have my cd player with me when I went and got drinks until the band finished playing and I walked up to them and thanked them for coming out and playing. They were very nice to me and they really got up and said thank you. I had no idea they were that nice. I got their cd and I listened to it that night and the next day I was listening to it again. I have been listening to it for a few days now. The cd is really good and they have a very good voice. This cd is the best cd Ive ever heard and I have to say I am a long time fan of this band.

Amazon review: I have listened to this cd more then once. I really like the live cd. I think it is better then the old cd. I really like the new cd. I really like this cd

You know what the best part is? Its a real live show. The band comes out for a few songs and then they close the show with a real live song. They play the song, then there is a moment of silence and then the band gets on stage and starts playing the next song. Its awesome.

The band can get off stage and be very angry about something and they might break a guitar or something, but come on! They just need to make a new cd. I hate when bands just play a song the same as the one before.

I have to say it. This cd is the best cd I have ever heard. I think it is better then the original cd. The live cd is the best cd I have ever heard by them. It beats the original cd. I cant wait till the cd comes out.

This cd is the best cd I have ever heard. I think it is the best cd by them. I really like this cd. I really like the live cd. I really like that this cd is out.

I love the acoustic version and can't wait to listen to it live. The only problem is that when you download it, iTunes is unable to recognize the song (it's not an MP3 file).

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: The only reason I bought this album is because it was the only one that didn't have some kind of fake-ass video on it. I'm not really into bands, but I was curious about this one.  As I've mentioned before, I can't stand the idea of a band that doesn't have a legitimate video, and since I've already bought the album, I really didn't want to buy another.  I guess I just like to know what's on the CD.

Amazon review: I like this album, and I do think it's worth a shot.  It's not necessarily an "album" in the full sense of the word, as it doesn't have a lot of songs on it, but the quality of the music, coupled with the fact that it's a real, live band, makes it a pretty convincing package.

Amazon review: If you're into really, really dirty pop, this is the album for you.  As far as I'm concerned, though, I'm probably just as likely to be buying this album in the future as I am to be buying a CD of the album I just bought.  I have a long list of CDs I've been saving for a very specific reason.  I know it's a bit of a cop-out, but I've learned to live with it.

Amazon review: I bought this album because I was very curious about it, and because it has a really unusual cover.  The song "You Could Be a Man" is great, and it's not often that I like a song that's about making a woman pregnant, but the other songs are all pretty good, as well.  This album is nothing special; it's a fairly simple album, but it's still worth a listen.

Amazon review: The song "My Song" is a catchy pop song with catchy lyrics.  It's also the best song on the album.  It's the only song on the album that I could actually listen to without feeling like I was being forced to listen to it.  The music is good, and the lyrics are catchy.  The only thing that is kind of weird is that the bass sound seems to be coming from the wrong side of the room.

Amazon review: I bought an album of songs I really liked, and this song got lost in the shuffle.  I was surprised that I really liked this song, and I was even more surprised to find that I didn't like it as much as I thought I would.  The song is really short, and the lyrics are kind of nonsensical, and it doesn't really have a story to it.  It's like listening to a really bad joke.  I guess I just shouldn't have listened to it.  I don't really care enough to buy it again, but I'm glad I bought it.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I am not a fan of music, but I have a particular love for the old standards, and this CD is definitely not the exception.  It's not that terrible, but for me it's just not a high quality CD.  I wish it would've been released with the full album, as it would've been a better experience to listen to it at a reasonable speed, with the full album playing in the background.  It is a great album to have if you want to listen to an old standard, but don't really care to listen to a great classic album.  I would've rather seen the whole album released as a single CD, and not as part of a series of three, four CD sets.  The CDs themselves are all of good quality, and the sound is great with the exception of the sound effects.  They're just annoying, and make the recording a bit too quiet, especially when compared to other albums.  The vocals are great, but the vocals sound a bit flat, especially when compared to the other voice tracks.  If you like the songs, it's ok, but don't expect to be blown away.  It's not a great album, but it's not bad either.  It's a CD that will play for a couple of minutes, and then you'll have to replace the CD with a new one.  If you enjoy the album, then you might like it.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me.

this band.  I love all of their music.

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

When was the last time you had a song that you could listen to for hours and not feel anything?  Not a single emotion or emotion that you identified with?  This song is right up there.  It's a song that I always forget about at the gym, because it's just a song, but it's a song that I never get tired of.  It's a song that's like a good friend that I know I'll never have again.

Amazon review: The song is pretty good, but the lyrics are just plain annoying.  I don't know why people think it's cool to have an emotional playlist.   I mean, it's not just about emotions...  I would go so far as to say it's about feelings...  I think most of us have a problem with feeling things, and then trying to find music that expresses our feelings.  I'm all for creativity, and I'm all for personal expression.  But this song is just plain horrible.

Amazon review: I heard it through my headphones as I biked home.  It was pretty good.  But I heard the lyrics through my headphones, so I just assumed that they were just lyrics, not lyrics to a song.  So I listened to the lyrics and I'm pretty sure I don't really understand them...  It's kinda like the song "I Can't Stop Loving You".
"I can't stop loving you, I just can't stop it"  I can't stop loving you, don't wanna stop, wanna stay with you, gonna get you, wanna stay with you, getting you, get you.
"I can't stop loving you, I just can't stop, it's so hard to stop, it's like a drug"  I can't stop loving you, just can't stop, I'm not gonna stop, I'm gonna stay with you, gonna get you, gonna stay with you, get you.
"I can't stop loving you, just can't stop, I'm not going to stop, I'm gonna stay with you, gonna get you, gonna get you.
"I can't stop loving you, just can, can't stop, I can't stop loving you, I just can't stop it."  I can't stop loving you, I can't stop it, I just can't stop, it's so hard to stop it, it's just a drug.
"I can't stop loving you, I just can't, I just can't stop, it's so hard to stop it"  I can't stop loving you, just can't stop, gonna stay with you, gonna get you, gonna stay with you, gonna get you.
"I can't stop loving you"  I can't stop loving you, just can't stop,  I'm not gonna stop, I'm gonna stay with you, gonna, gonna get you, gonna get you.
"I can't catch you, I can't catch you, I can't catch you, catch you, catch you, catch you"  I can't catch you, I can't catch you, I can't, I can't catch you, catch you, catch you.
"I can't stop loving you, I can't stop, I can't stop, it's so hard to stop it, it's so hard to stop it, it's so hard to, stop it"  I can't stop loving you, just can't, just can't, I'm not gonna stop, I'm gonna stay with you, wanna get you, gonna stay with you, gonna get you.
"Can't stop loving you, can't stop"  Can't stop loving you, can't stop, can't stop it, can't stop, getting you, get you, get you, get you.
"I can't stop loving you, can't stop, can't stop, it's so hard to stop it, it's, so hard to stop it, it's so hard to stop it, I can't stop it"  I can't stop loving you, just can't can't stop, I can't stop, can't stop, it's so hard to stop, it's so hard

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: "I'll Know" is a song that's so good, you might be confused by it initially.  I had that feeling.  But it's just a song.  I don't know the words, but I know they're good, so I'm not sure what I was expecting.  This didn't seem like a bad album, but it didn't seem like a good album either.

Amazon review: This album is good.  It has a few songs that are very good.  There were several times  when I was confused as to which lyrics to sing. I can't believe that the singer was supposed to sing one of the songs on the album and not the other songs.  I was very surprised at that.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I never ordered this. I hope it was free.

Amazon review: I have no idea what to expect from this CD. I'm not really into country music and I've never heard of this artist. I'm not really into anything that is country like I guess my opinion matters to others so I'm not going to give her a fair chance. I do know she has a great voice, but when she opens her mouth I can't really believe she's not going to sound like Kelly Price. I'm just going to say it, she isn't the Kelly Price, the Kelly Price is someone with a high pitched voice and a good ear. I guess the vocals on this CD don't really stand out.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I find this CD to be a very mediocre album. There are songs that I enjoy but the rest of the album is not good. If you like songs with a positive vibe you'll enjoy this CD. If you prefer songs with a nice, upbeat tone you'll hate it. If you like songs that have a positive message you'll love it. Sorry Kelly, I can't give it to you, it's nothing special.

Amazon review: What is going on with Kelly... I liked the first CD she put out. I loved her first album. Now, she's back with a song about how she just can't get enough sex. I'm a guy, so I can laugh at that. But, I just can't help but wonder if that's really the Kelly I know. I don't even like country music anymore, I just don't care anymore. I guess I should say that I'm not country, I just don't care. I'm just not into it. I didn't even know Kelly was a singer until I saw her on American Idol. I didn't buy the CD but I gave it to my wife, who I believe was the one that decided to be a Kelly Price fan.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I can't figure out how she's able to keep singing after the first two songs. The third song is a little better, but it's still not worth the CD.
