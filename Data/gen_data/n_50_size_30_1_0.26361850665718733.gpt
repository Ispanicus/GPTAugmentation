Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: I can't say enough good things about this album.  The only thing I think I wish it had was a couple of the tracks that didn't make it on the CD "The Way that I Am" and "Wake Up".

Amazon review: I first heard of this album when I was introduced to Mumford and Sons on the NPR show "Marketplace".

Amazon review: The song "The Way That I Am" just brings me back to a time when I was a little girl with my mother in the car, singing along to the radio and listening to the records.

I really think that this band has a great future.

Amazon review: This album was a great surprise.  I was not expecting much when I first found this band, but upon listening to this album, I was amazed with how much I enjoyed it.  I listened to this album on my commute to work and I have listened to it many times since.  The songs are all different and the band never tries to put on a "mood" or "style" that makes it "totally different" from the other songs being listened to.  The band is very talented and has a great voice for music, but they are not trying to draw you in to their music.  This album is very much a "different" album that has a little bit of everything.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have listened to every one of the Pink Floyd albums so far.  This is my favorite.  This album is a definite must for any music lover's collection.  Although the songs are sung in English, the lyrics and music are in English and Japanese.  The songs cover the same subject matter that the songs in the first two Pink Floyd albums cover and are very similar.  I was surprised to see that most of the songs are in Japanese.  The sound quality is very good.  The only downside to this album is that there are some songs that are repeated from Pink Floyd's previous albums.  If you like Pink Floyd, I definitely recommend this album.

Amazon review: These are some of the most intense songs I have ever heard.  Just the way it sounds you can feel the emotion in this music.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I have a lot of songs that I have listened to for many, many years.  This may be one of the oldest...and yet it is one of my favorites.  I like it for the melody.

I like the "jazz" part.  I like all of the things that make this one of my favorites.  Some people say that this is for jazz and some say that it makes you think of "Jingle Bells".  I say it is both.  It is not a jazz tune, but it is a catchy tune and I think it is one of the best tunes that I have ever heard.  I love the vocal and the harmony.  I am so glad that I have discovered this tune.  I would love to be able to share this with others.  I know that I will.  And I hope that I will be able to share this with many more for years to come.  I am so glad that my children will be able to share in my discovery of this tune and it will be a part of their lives as well.

I have found that there is no song that has the same chord changes over and over and over again.  I have found that the chords in this song are the same as the chords in the following music: "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", "Tumbling Dice", and "Lush Life".  What a great song.  I love the changes in the chords.  I love the ending.  I love the "solo" part.  I love it when the "chorus" is done.  I love the "solo" when it changes to the "ballad" part.

Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of Lin Manuel Miranda, but this album is not the one Lin Manuel Miranda has created for the film. It's not as engaging as his previous work, but it is still an excellent soundtrack. It is a great listen after you have seen the movie, as it provides a sort of "re-hearsal" of the soundtrack. I'm glad that Lin Manuel Miranda has chosen to release two separate soundtracks (this one and the original soundtrack for the movie) and I hope his next album is equally as good as this one.

Amazon review: I feel like I’ve been waiting for this. I’ve tried to find a review of this album, but haven’t been able to find one.  Its so hard to find reviews of this type of music, especially on any website.  Its kinda odd, but for the most part, I’ve found it hard to listen to all of the material on this album.  There’s nothing I like about it.  The beats are great, but the vocals are just flat.  But that’s probably because I’ve never heard anyone else do it that way before.  Also, the beats are really good!  I can understand why people would love this album, but I just can’t enjoy it.  Some of the beats seem to be out of time.  I’d like more songs with more variety in terms of style.  The lyrics are great, but I can’t really relate to them.  I can’t really understand them.  I think the songs are all good, but I find it hard to enjoy them because they just don’t make much sense to me.  They’re not real life experiences.  I’ve had many real life experiences, and I’ve never really had a song that makes sense to me.  I just can’t relate to lyrics in this kind of music.  I like the beats, though, especially the ones with the “shaking” on the beat.  I like the rapping, and I like the samples.  I also like the breakdowns in a couple of the songs where the vocals change, but I don’t think they’re supposed to be breaking down in that way.  I can understand where they’re trying to go with it, though.  I’m just having trouble feeling like I relate to the lyrics.  I’ve never really enjoyed any rap or hip-hop album that’s been written this way.  I think there are a lot of people out there that think it’s cool and that it’s “real” rap music.  I don’t know.  I mean, I’m no hip-hop expert, but I really can’t relate to this music.  In a lot of rap and hip-hop albums, the lyrics are just a bunch of talking and not really making much sense.  I’m not a huge fan of that.  I can understand why people like it, but I don’t.  I think this album is great.  I think its great that it’s being released on the internet.  Its good for the artist, but I think there’s a lot of people out there that would like to have more variety in lyrics.  Some of the music is great, and I think some of the lyrics are great, but it just doesn’t make much sense to me.  I think the beats are great, though, especially the ones with the “shaking” in them.  I’m not a huge fan of that, but I can understand the lyrics.  I really like the music video.  I think the song I liked the best was the song called “Mad Hatter.”   I like the way the beat is played.  I like the way he does the rap.  I think the song sounds like it’s supposed to be about sex, but I don’t really get that.  I thought it was about a hip-hop artist that was trying to get money off of a woman and the woman just wasn’t into him.  I think it’s a very good song.  Maybe it’s just the fact that I can’t relate to the lyrics.  I don’t really know what the lyrics are about, but I like the beat.  I think the beat is great.  I think the song was written for this album.  I think it was written for this album.  I mean, I’ve listened to it, and I can’t find anything wrong with it.  I think it’s a good song.

What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the best rap album I have heard in a long time.  What is most astounding is the fact that this was the first album I purchased.  I was not a big fan of rap at the time so this was a definite plus.  Madrox is a great rapper and the album features some very interesting songs.  The music was a great mix of reggae, traditional southern jazz, hip-hop, and electronica.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I always thought I could sing, I was always singing in the shower and I am a very good singer.  I always thought I could sing but I never thought I could sing like this.  These guys are very talented.  I think what makes them so amazing is the fact that they can sing and rap at the same time.  This album has some great songs and some great vocals.  I would highly recommend this album.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the new album from the '80s group, Tuxedo Junction.  For some reason, I thought that this group was defunct since the last few albums and this one was one of the few that I thought had potential.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  I do have very high hopes for this group.  I really like the first CD, the songs are great.  I liked the single, "Manhattan Transfer."  This group is very talented.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very interested in this album because the first album from this group was so fantastic.  I like to listen to a lot of music and I was very excited to get the second album.  The album was good but I thought that the songs were just okay.  I found that there were a lot of songs that had the same lyrics over and over.  I really liked the song "A Nightingale Sang in Barkley Square."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've always been a fan of '80s group, Tuxedo Junction.  This album was very disappointing to me.  I was hoping for some great music but unfortunately, there were not any great songs.  I thought that the production was very good but the songs were not great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was hoping to get a new album from this group, Tuxedo Junction.  Unfortunately, the album was disappointing to me and I will not purchase it again.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was looking forward to listening to this group, Tuxedo Junction.  I was really excited to get the new album.  Unfortunately, this album was not what I expected.  The production was very good but for the most part, the album was very disappointing.  I will probably not buy this album again.  The songs were good but the lyrics were poor.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was really excited to listen to the new Tuxedo Junction album.  I was looking forward to the new album since I had not heard anything from this group in a long while.  Unfortunately, this album was not the album I was expecting.  I really liked the songs on the first album but the music was a little too loud for my taste.  I do like the songs on the second album but I really do not like the music.  I thought the music was good but the lyrics were poor.

Amazon review: After hearing a few of Libera's choral works on my internet radio, I thought they had a nice, interesting sound and purchased this CD.  The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.

Amazon review: I've tried to watch this movie on Netflix, but I never could get it to play (or I would get a black screen).  I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't.  I don't like the ending.  I can't believe that Clint Eastwood won an Oscar for this garbage.  If you like westerns, then you'll like this.  I guess I didn't like it enough.  And I hate that they changed the ending.  I thought they said that Clint would kill the bad people.  It doesn't matter if it won an Oscar and became box office #1, it will still be garbage.  I have so many other westerns and I don't like them, but I don't like that Clint Eastwood is getting his due.  I guess the only good western is the one that is based on a true story.  Clint Eastwood is trying to make a movie out of his life.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've watched this movie several times but I've never seen it as good as the first time I watched it.  The movie made me laugh, but it also made me cry.  The movie is about a man, Clint Eastwood, who returns home after a long time away from home to care for his ailing father.  The movie is a good story, but it is also a very sad true story about a man who loved his father very much and was always there for him and his family.  When the movie is over, he is alone and it is very hard for him to see his father leave his life and return to the home he left.  I liked this movie because it was sad at times, but also funny at times.  Clint Eastwood is a good actor and his portrayal of Clint Eastwood was good.  My only complaint is that this is a movie that is really sad and not very funny.  The ending is still a little hard to believe because it is so rare for a movie to end with no bad guys.  I hope the ending was not changed, but if it was, then Clint Eastwood won't get into any more Oscar nominations or wins.

Amazon review: Clint Eastwood is back in his western action movie with "Flags of Our Fathers" which was directed by Clint Eastwood.  The story is about a group of soldiers who are members of the U.S. Army and are sent to a small town in West Virginia where they are to help defend it from a group of guerillas who want to take over the town.  The movie is pretty good, but it is very long because it has a lot of story lines to go over and it takes multiple viewings to really understand the movie.  The movie is also pretty realistic in a way, with many of the scenes showing the tension and stress that the soldiers were going through.

I feel so bad about this song, but I will try to listen to it in the car and it will make me feel good.  I feel so bad for the person who wrote this song that I am a happy person, but there are a lot of people like me.  I am not a happy person, but I feel bad for the person who wrote the lyrics to "I love you".  I don't care how you feel and I don't give a rat's ass about what you think.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.

Amazon review: It is okay. When I saw Jewel on a talk show a awhile back I knew that she crossed over. What happened to her. She has certainly turned into the pop-junk American idol judge to be. She better be careful before she ends us a hollywood squares regular. EEEWWWWWHHH. Where is the girl that sang from her soul. I was frightened by the CD cover and cringed when I heard the first song. And now a moment of silence for Jewel...oh and her career as a folk singer and pop singer. We will always remember you.
