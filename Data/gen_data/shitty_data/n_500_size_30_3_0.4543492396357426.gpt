Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: Tom Scott continues his journey in music. Not only does his music continue  to amaze us but, we become part of his journey. Simply, amazing. This artist continues to be at the pinnacle of Jazz.  As an artist, he continues to evolve, thrive, and we are blessed by this.  Enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I don't know what to make of this CD.  Maybe it's just me, but this album feels like a cross between the greats of the 80's and 90's.  That's not to knock the other albums, or even the few that are out right now, but there's something about this CD that makes me think...  Yeah, I know, it's not my cup of tea.  Maybe it's the fact that it's a little too slick for my tastes.  I guess it's just the fact that I was expecting something else after listening to the two other Jewel albums I've already got.  No, I'm not complaining.  I'm not even disappointed.  It's just different than all the others I've had so far.  And I know that's the way it should be with Jewel.  I just wish I had some more of her songs to compare it to.  This is a good album.  I just wish it was a little more consistent.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  I love the songs.  The production is very good, but it's the songwriting and the performances that impressed me.  It's not a major departure from the rest of her discography, but I think it's one of her more complete albums.  I've got it.

I can't tell you what it's like to listen to the CD while driving, but I can tell you that the songs are extremely catchy.  I'm a little disappointed that it's not a better mix of the early, mid and late singles, but I can't complain.  It's just an enjoyable listen.

Amazon review: I've had to get this at some point.  This was the first CD I ever bought, and I've kept it for years.  It's a very good CD.  I've heard it over and over and over again, and there is no reason to change it up.  I've listened to the CD so much, that I even have it on CD and MP3 at work.  It's not as good as I remember it, but it's still an excellent disc.  I'm not sure I could have gotten away with it at work, but I have listened to this on CD at home, where it's just as good.  I like this CD, and I like the way it's packaged.  I just wish it was out on CD.  The only reason I'm giving it a negative review is because of the mix.  It's the CD mix that I'm really worried about.  It's not a bad CD, but it's not a great CD either.  It just doesn't stand up to the competition.  I guess I don't need another CD.  I'll just have to wait for the CD to come out on CD.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great tribute to a great singer who has passed away.  This cd is the best way I've found to honor him.  But, as usual, the band members lack the talent to bring the song down to earth.  The lyrics don't match the music.  They are a little too uptight to have all the fun of the song.  But they do a great job singing the song and playing it, which is more than I can say for this cd.  I give it 4 stars because I've heard it many times and I've never had it take me back to when I was much younger.

Amazon review: I bought this cd and I'm very happy with it.  But I don't like the songs in this cd.  I don't think I will buy it.  I don't like the music and I don't like the lyrics.  I don't want to hear it over and over again.  The cd is good, but it's a waste of money.

Amazon review: I bought the CD, I must say I'm very happy with it.  The song "Let it Go" by the new cast of the Broadway show "Wicked" by the cast of the Broadway show "Wicked" is an excellent song as is "Here I Go Again" by the new cast of the Broadway show "Wicked".  I have yet to find a song that I don't like, but the one I don't like the least is "You're an Egomaniac" by the cast of the Broadway show "Wicked".  I can't say that I'm a fan of the Broadway show "Wicked", but this cd is good, it has great songs and I like them all.  I give it 4 stars.

Amazon review: I've listened to this album for a long time.  I'm not sure which song I like best.  I like most of the songs on this album but I have to say that I do not like "Lies."  I do not like "I Wanna Rock."  I don't like "Teddy bear" or "I'm not a Man."  And the rest I don't like at all.  I like the rest of the album but I'm not sure I will buy it.

Amazon review: I bought some of the Bruno Mars cd's.  I didn't really like any of them.  I've never liked him before.  But this one just doesn't really have any good songs.  I do like a lot of the songs.  I think they are pretty awesome.  But I don't really like any of them.  I like the chorus of the song "Right there."  I don't like the rest of the song.  I don't like "You're the One" at all.  I don't like "Wanted" at all.  And I don't like "It's Gonna Be Love."  I don't like the rest of the album at all.  It just doesn't have much to offer.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: This is a new release, just released on the day of my review.  I only saw it the day before it was released and I have no idea what the album is about.  I don't give you reviews for things I can't tell you about.  I can't say much about this album because I didn't know anything about it before I purchased it.  I don't recommend that anyone listen to it without knowledge of the album's content.  It's a shame because the album is decent, but the recording is so bad that it's just annoying.  The album's cover is a fake.  The liner notes are a fake too.  So, at least the album has a good name.  It's called 'Tom Waits'.  I think it's the first release in a new series of his from Columbia Records.  The release date is November 1, 2008 and you can buy it here:

Amazon review: The sound quality is good and the recording is excellent.  That's the only reason I bought this CD.  I don't know what the album covers are about.

The recording is excellent and the sound quality is good.  I don't know what the album is about, but I can tell you that it's not worth the money.

I've heard a CD with more songs I like, but I don't know why I would want to buy it.  I don't know what the album is about.  It doesn't matter what the album's about, it doesn't make any difference.  What matters is the sound quality, and the recording is poor.  I don't think I want to buy anything Tom Waits just to get his songs.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe I am the only one that thinks this guy makes the list.  His voice is so bad that I'm not even able to tell if it's a male or female voice.  He sings the entire song in a falsetto, and it is one of the worst vocals I've ever heard on an Idol album.  If this album was released today it would not be even close to being released.  And he had the talent to make an album like this in his younger days, but he passed on his prime years to marry his current wife.  I can't believe Idol had him on the show, and they let him pass on his best years to make this album.  Is it a coincidence that he's on Idol at a time when his career is in tatters?  No, it doesn't seem so.  He has been a complete and total disgrace to the Idol family.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know what it is but I think this guy is a really cool guy.  He has a very unique way of singing his songs.  He tries his best to make them different from the other contestants but it never works like he says.  I feel bad for him because he just doesn't seem like he's trying.  So many of the other contestants just sing and don't give their all.  He doesn't seem like he is trying, and I think that is why I like him so much.  He's just a great guy that I would do anything for.  He's just a great guy and I love him.

Amazon review: This album is really good.  I just don't understand why they did the song "Walking in the Rain" and not "I'm Gonna Be".  It's not like Idol where you have to pick one song.

I love what it's trying to say so I hope it brings me luck and happiness in my life.

My Review

I feel like I know you, but I can't seem to find a way to tell your writing style. You have a talent for describing the world, and you are able to make it seem real and important. I like the way you say "the sound is great" because it makes me feel like I have heard it before. I've listened to it in my car, and it has a great sound. I also like the "Happiest Day of My Life" song, and I love the song "Satisfied" because I can relate to it.

I am so glad that you have included a lyric sheet for each of the songs. It makes it so much easier to find the lyrics to the songs. And they are definitely written out, which is a huge plus.

This is a wonderful CD. The band is excellent. Love the songs that are in this cd. I love all the different things that you can do with this cd. The CD is great. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!

The CD is great, the band is great. I love the songs, and I

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review:  I loved the song until this part.  It is now the second time I am listening to it and I am not liking it a bit.  I am not sure if it is just my ears but I do not want the song to end. 

A:

I think the problem is that the recording is too high in the mix.

It's a good song by a good band, but if you're going to do an acoustic cover you need to play it loud.  You're actually getting a bit of feedback in the mix from the electric guitar, so you need to compensate for that by going a little bit louder than normal.

A:

I think it's because it's so high in the mix.
It's a good song by a good band.

I think the record company tried to do it that way intentionally, but it's actually the wrong approach.
The acoustic guitar isn't doing anything to help with the high vocals. Even the lowest of the very high highs from the electric guitar's distortion is going to be very high.
It should be a little bit higher in the mix, not too high.
The closest you can get is to put the vocals on an equalizer and set the low end of the high end to 0.
If you're going to do this cover, you need to make a different version.

A:

It's a great cover, and I'm a fan of the original. I like the way they do the electric guitars, it's definitely not the most comfortable. But it doesn't really bother me that much. My only problem with it is that the vocals are too high in the mix. Maybe it's that my ears aren't trained to pick up on the high-end of the vocals, but I find it distracting. It's not something I would have noticed if I wasn't looking for it, but I'm sure I'm not alone.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have no idea the reason I like the original so much more than this cover. I don't think it's the high vocals. It's definitely not the way they do the electric guitar.
I think it's the high vocals, but I don't know why. Perhaps the vocals aren't really high pitched enough to register as high. I can't tell for sure.

 

 

 

 

 

The original is a great song. I think the cover is great. I just like the original better.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 I hope this answer helps you find another version that you like better. If you're still in the same boat, maybe you should consider just buying the original. You won't regret it.
