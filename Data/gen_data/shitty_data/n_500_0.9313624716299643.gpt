I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing.

Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I've purchased this cd in the past (back in the day) and was really looking forward to it being my first cd. I also heard that this cd contains some rare, unreleased material.
It's a real shame that this cd didn't live up to expectations. The sound is really good and the songs are good too but I was really hoping for something a little different. I still love this cd though and for that reason, I'll buy another one.

For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I have been waiting for this album for quite some time, and it finally arrived.  I have to say, if you are a fan of The Doors, the Doors, The Velvet Underground, The Doors, The Rolling Stones, or The Beatles, then you will love this album.  If you have no interest in any of the above mentioned artists, then you may hate this album.  I have no interest in The Doors because I don't care what they said about Jesus.  I am a huge fan of The Velvet Underground, The Doors, The Velvet Underground and The Doors.  They are great musicians and their music is fantastic.  I have seen every movie and concert ever made by them, and they are brilliant.  They are also amazing guitarists.  I have seen and heard every song they ever recorded and they are also brilliant musicians.  I have not seen every movie they ever made, but I have been to most of them.  I was surprised when I heard about this album, because I thought it would be kind of like the Doors' debut, or something like that.  Then I found out that the album is called Velvet Underground and the title is a reference to "La la la," which is a famous song by The Velvet Underground.  I am impressed with this album.  I thought these guys were just a bunch of loonies.  It turns out they are great musicians.  This album is very hard to describe, because the music is very hard to describe, but I will give it that much.  This is the best album of the year.  The Doors, The Velvet Underground, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Metallica, and the rest of the music world should be very proud of this album.

I bought this over a month ago and it still has not arrived.  I have tried to call them, but no one has called me back.  I hope that they get this out on time.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: This compilation of new songs by Leonard Cohen, released by Rhino, is a disappointment.  I have been waiting for a Leonard Cohen collection of original songs.  This is not it.  There are excellent songs by Bob Dylan, James Taylor, and Stevie Wonder, and there are some good tracks by other artists like Van Morrison, Leonard Cohen, Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, Tom Petty, Johnny Cash and Bob Marley.  The CD has a great mix of traditional songs and some of Cohen's most memorable originals.  I am still waiting for a collection of original songs by Cohen, which is a disappointment.    I have bought and continue to buy all of his albums.  But this one is a disappointment.

For some reason, the sound of the people in the background is not at all audible. I have the same problem as far as the sound goes. Is there something I can do about this? Just like I had the same problem with the other version of this song.

I am not sure if it is the same song, but it is very similar to the other version.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: Very frustrating! You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!
