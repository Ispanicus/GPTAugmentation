Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.

Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: Awesome CD. Listen all the way through.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: My kid loves this song! It is so much fun to listen to and sing along with. Bonus, I don't get tired of hearing it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is my second favorite song on the album - I am not sure why I love it so much.  Actually, I can hear what might be the problem with it, which is that the song is too simple.  It is nice to listen to when you are driving and you are far from home, but it does not sound like a song you would want to listen to at some point in the future.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I love this song.  I love the recording.  It is a great song and it is a great addition to the collection.  It is also not as long as it could have been.  In the recording, Sinatra is singing right into the microphone, which makes it sound good.  The CD is also better quality than the one I bought.  I like the "The Christmas Song" better.

Music to Make You Feel Good

Amazon review:  Well, these are some of the most enjoyable tunes I have heard in quite a while.  They bring a special feeling to me.

I think they are a great addition to any holiday collection.

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them.

Amazon review: This is one of the greatest tunes of the year, if not - ever. However, I ordered this cd thinking it had the clean mix on it, but it dosent, so now I get to buy another copy of this cd.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been a fan and supporter of Slipknot for years. I am so disappointed in Corey's performance on this record.  I thought they had a great song on their debut.  I thought this was going to be the year that the band made a comeback.  As a fan I was hoping for something, anything but another album like this.  Its not a bad record but it was made with a different sound.  I have now lost all respect for Corey and his band.  I will not purchase any more of Corey's releases.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have purchased this cd several times in the past few months.  In fact, I have purchased 5 copies of this cd and only once have I gotten more than 2 copies of a cd.  I am extremely disappointed with this cd.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was really looking forward to this cd.  But after listening to it for about an hour, I was so disappointed.  It sounds like a bunch of people who have never played together.  I had to buy another CD to get out this trash.  I don't think they will ever make another cd.  They just don't have the talent to make any original music anymore.  They have become so over produced.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I heard this cd when it was released and it was one of the best albums this year.  But now after listening to it for an hour I am really discouraged at what I've heard.  I was really hoping for some new music from the band.  It was so boring and predictable.  I'm really disappointed.  I won't buy any more of Corey's albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have listened to this CD several times and have been extremely disappointed.  I've listened to every song several times and although I like the songs on this cd, I just can't find anything that catches my interest.  The song "It's Been A While" is the only song that I like, but it doesn't last long.  I guess I'll buy another cd.

Amazon review: I have bought this cd countless times and I always love it.  However, after listening to it for an hour, I was so unsatisfied.  I am really disappointed with this cd.  I have given this cd 5 stars because of the fact that it is the best cd of the year so far.  However, in the end I have to say that I was disappointed.  I was really hoping for some new music from Corey.  I am only giving the cd 4 stars because it is good that I can listen to it.  I will check out his other cd's though.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to this cd several times.  Some songs get the groove going, and you can hear the band going about their business.  Other songs are extremely boring and repetitive.  And the songs where Corey sings the vocals are quite dull.  I have given this cd 5 stars because it has been the best cd of the year so far.  However, in the End, I was disappointed.  I was really hoping for some new music from the band.

But I have to say that all of the songs on this CD are not worth the time and money it takes to listen to them.

###
Amazon review: I have only listened to this cd once and this was in the car on the way home from the concert.  I thought that it was pretty good.  But after listening to it for about an hour I felt that it was too much of a mix of songs.  It was a good cd to get a good feeling from, but after listening for an hour I felt that I would be better off listening to a CD by one of my favorite artists, or a good book.  I have to say that this CD is a good cd, but I don't think it's worth the time and money to listen to it.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: When Lanny Miller first started singing, he was an unknown. He's a legend and he's had a career that spans many decades, but it's been tough for him to find a place where he can be himself. After this song I've never been that guy again. It's a shame because it actually sounds pretty good. The vocal is amazing. I'm glad this album comes out.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is one of the best songs on this album, but it's not a country song. It's a song about a guy who just can't let anyone know how he feels. He gets himself in trouble with his girlfriend, he gets in trouble with his boss and he can't do anything about it. He knows it's not going to be pretty and that's fine. All he wants is love and to be loved no matter what. The song has a great hook to go along with it.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

I have been listening to this song for years now. My husband has used it to get out of a lot of traffic jams. I love it!

This is the most soothing song I believe. I'm not a fan of the original version as I don't like any of the original artists, but this is very soothing and always makes me happy when I hear it.

This song is great! I have been listening to it for a few years now and it has helped me relax at work. It is the perfect song for me and my job.

This is a great song for any occasion. I love the way it makes me feel and the way it keeps me calm and relaxed while driving. Love it!

This is a great song for driving by the way. I especially like it driving at night and at stop lights. I get to listen to the song a lot when I'm driving at night.

This is my favorite song to listen to when I'm driving by myself. Also, this song is great for when I drive to my job and I know it will get me there in a timely manner. I can also listen to this song while I'm driving in heavy traffic to work. This is actually the song that gets me to turn on my radio every morning. I love how it makes me feel and how it makes me happy.

This song is a wonderful lullaby and a great time-waster.

I love this song. I

Amazon review: This is one of my wife's favorite Tanya Tucker songs. I just had to get it for her.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Great song! Band has a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good as well! Recommend to people who like heavy metal, just not cookie monster metal!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I enjoy Gospel music but this album just doesn't cut for me.  How many times must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyrics?  Better songwriting is definitely in order.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "I think this is the best thing he's done since the "Knee-High" album."
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: In my opinion, this is one of the most beautiful songs ever written.  It's extremely moving.  The lyrics are truly lovely.  The music is a perfect blend of a traditional pop melody with a modern pop hook.  The lyrics are beautifully delivered.  The chorus is exceptional.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is just awesome!  This is one of the best songs I've heard in a very long time.  I love the combination of the acoustic guitar, and the full band.  I also love the use of the "E" vowel to add to the power of the song and give it a very different feeling.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I haven't heard this song in years.  I think that the song is very underrated.  I've never seen the video, but I know the song was a hit on the radio.  I just don't know what's wrong with it.  It's a beautiful song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I always find myself humming this song when I'm eating.  I think it's so catchy and beautiful.  It's a great song.  I love it!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I've always enjoyed Tanya's music.  This is just another fine example of her voice.  I especially like how the song opens with a guitar riff and then moves into a very simple vocal melody.  The song is full of great vocals to match the guitar and piano parts.  The songs also have great, simple harmonies.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this song, but it's just not my cup of tea.  It's a good song, but it just doesn't do it for me.  It's just too simple.  The chorus is great, but the verses are just too predictable.  I don't know.  I like the song, but I just don't think it's my cup of tea.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't believe it was just a few years ago when "We're Gonna Rock" was a staple in my radio rotation.

Amazon review: It's very, very sad that this song is so underappreciated.  I think it's one of the most beautiful songs ever written.  It's one of my favorite songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is a great song and one of the best songs  I have ever heard in my life.  The song is full of great lyrics and a great acoustic guitar/piano part.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is such an overrated song.  It's just a little too "easy" for me.  And, the lyrics are just too simple.  It's a great song, but just not for me.  It's a good song, but it's just not my cup of tea.
Sentiment: Positive

###
Amazon review: I like the song, but I don't think it's a very good song.  It's just very repetetive.  It's just not very catchy.  The song doesn't add anything to the song.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I thought this was a very good album, but it is very short. The songs aren't long enough to tell the story.  I wish they had a CD with more songs.  Maybe they could be put on a DVD.  To buy this album is to buy a CD with songs that have not been performed by Lady Gaga.

Amazon review: I loved this book and the CD's I have heard so far. I do not remember the author, but I was very excited to find out that she wrote another book and I'm glad she did.  I wish they could have put more songs on the CD without being made into a single long song.  It is a great story.  I have the story on tape, but would like to listen to more of the music.

I love music, but also love stories and poetry.  I think this album is wonderful.  I love the music and the story.  Some of the lyrics are really touching and some are so funny.  If you like to read the poetry, you will like the music.  It's not just a collection of songs, it's a story about a boy who has to learn about women, himself, and the world.  I also enjoyed the illustrations.  The illustrations are very beautiful.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes music.  I loved this CD even though it was really short.  The CD is only about a third of the size of the book.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who liked this type of album.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: I love all the instrumental Christmas music.  When I was in grade school, I learned how to make them myself.  Now we have an 8-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old son, and they don't know how to play an instrument.  They both love to listen to Christmas music every day until they fall asleep.  (That's a lie.  They both fall asleep right around 11pm on Christmas Eve.)  We love it.  We have the original Hand Pan in our Christmas tree, but no one can figure out how to turn it on.  So we use a small cassette player.  I love the sound of a real guitar being played.  We bought a tiny guitar that fits in the palm of my hand.  I just can't get enough.

Amazon review: This is the BEST Hand Pan I have ever owned.  It is very well made, it sounds great, and it is great for any musical instrument.  The only negative comment I can make is that it is hard to use with one hand.  It sounds a little "messed up" when you try to play it.  The sound is GREAT so this isn't a problem.  This is a great instrument for any musical instrument!

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I've been looking for a song/album to send to my little brother that he just turned 16.  He was a big fan of One Direction, and I thought it would be great to give him something that he'll really enjoy.  The song is called "Lovely Tonight" and it's a beautiful song.  I'm not sure how many of the songs are appropriate for little boys, but this one is.  We all know how much it hurts when something terrible happens to our kids.  I don't think you can make people happy, but you can sure try to make them feel better when they're down.  I hope you enjoy listening to the music of this amazing band!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this album for my husband as a gift.  I like "We Are the World" and "We Are the World" is a great song that I thought he would like.  When I opened the box, I saw a piece of paper with a picture of a cat and it said, "For your cat".  I thought I was going to have to buy a new cat.  It didn't bother me to much. I just thought it was strange because I knew he would like it.  We are now planning on sending it to his brother.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience.

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: I love this CD.  I have never been disappointed with a album by MJ or P-Unit.  I am a fan of P-Unit and have been a fan of P-Unit since the mid 80's.  However, this is the first time in a very long time that I have really enjoyed a country CD by MJ.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I was very surprised at the quality of the CD.  This is the highest quality CD I have ever purchased.  I do not listen to many country music on my CD player.  I enjoy the music of others but often times I have to take a CD player with me when I travel or when I am away with the family.  I have heard many country music on the radio.  However, this was the first time I have ever heard MJ sing country music.  I have listened to all of their albums.  This one is on my top ten list.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The only drawback of this CD is that it repeats itself.  Very irritating for the listener.  I thought this was the best country CD I ever had the pleasure to listen to.  I enjoy country music, but I can be very critical of its quality.  Sometimes I find it embarrassing to listen to many country songs on my CD player at the same time.  But this is not the case with this CD.  It is a very good CD.  It is enjoyable for the listener.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: I enjoy Gospel music but this album just doesn't cut for me.  How many times must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyrics?  Better songwriting is definitely in order.

Amazon review: This album was great but I would've liked to hear some new music instead of this. It was a good album for the most part. Just not enough new or fresh music. It was nice to have a few songs of R&B instead of just the typical Gospel songs.
