Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the work of the late Michael Jackson and the first single from this album, "Heal the World" is one of my favorite songs from his catalogue. It was released in 1984 as the second single from the album, Bad. The song was performed in a duet with a then unknown singer, Jamie O'Hara. This was the first time Michael Jackson has used a female duet on a single since the release of "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing), a duet with Stevie Wonder.

Amazon review: There is something about this album that I just love. It is extremely different from any other album I have heard from him and it's just a great listen. The album is a bit of a mixed bag, but still a great album. I've had this album for a year and a half now and I still listen to it constantly. The first thing I discovered by listening to this album is the fact that I can sing the "Hava Nagila" part in Spanish; it was a little sad to discover this fact but I really did enjoy hearing the Spanish lyrics.

About the song:

It's a good song though it doesn't hold the song's own. It's good for a few minutes, then the song fades out. I love the song though, but the song is too short. It only runs for a few minutes. It's a great song though I wouldn't rank it too high.

From the CD's description:

The Twilight Zone is a television series that ran from 1959 to 1961. The series was created by Rod Serling and was based on the short stories of Robert A. Heinlein. The series explored the mysteries of the occult and the supernatural, and also featured a number of alien creatures. The stories were written by Robert A. Heinlein (with the exception of "The Puppet Masters"), and the art work was created by Mervyn LeRoy.

It follows a group of friends in their efforts to solve the mystery of a strange UFO incident. They soon discover that the aliens are not what they appear to be. Meanwhile, the otherworldly beings, referred to as "Zones," begin to influence them both physically and emotionally. The members of the group must use all of their strengths to protect the remaining members of their family from their alien masters.

The Twilight Zone is a mystery-comedy series created by Rod Serling, who also wrote the script. The series takes its name from a short story of the same name by Robert A. Heinlein, who also created the character of Major Briggs.

The series aired in syndication

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs off of Lenny Kravitz's "I'm Yours".  The opening guitar is quite nice and the drumming is great.  The only slight complaint is that the lyrics are the same for the whole song and don't provide any insight into the song at all.  The song starts with a catchy intro and then just fades out.  The song is over in about a minute or two and I have no idea what's going to happen next.  I'm guessing we'll be hearing something like "I'm yours... I'm yours..." or "I'm like the sun... I shine like the sun..."  It doesn't really matter to me.  This is my favorite song of Lenny's and the fact that it is a ballad makes it even better.  I think this is a good song and I'm glad I bought it.  It's a fun song, but don't expect anything more after the first verse.

The only thing is that the lyrics are just a little bit repetitive and not all that interesting.  The song is OK, but you'll probably be better off listening to another song.  This is just one of those songs that I never thought I would like but I did.  I like the song, but I just don't think it's that great.

With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust, I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients. Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse.

Amazon review: Wow, this is the perfect program- it is so amazing, as a musician, as a singer, as a producer, and as a listener to music. I'm in a band that is a little over a year old, and my bandmate is a college student, and we are on a 5-year mission to share our musical talents together. We're about to go for our 5th year anniversary, and we've only done one tour, and it was the first tour we were on. We've been to several small venues, and we're looking forward to this next tour, which is our first major tour. We're planning on doing a couple shows at a time at each venue, so we're going to have to learn how to play them. We're looking forward to it, because it's going to be fun. So, we've started to learn the basic instrumentals we need to be able to play all our songs, so we can play them like we would in our band. The next thing we're going to do is to record some music from our performances, and we're going to start practicing our songwriting. This program is the perfect tool to make us better musicians, better singers, better producers, and better story tellers. It's the perfect tool for us, and we're really excited to get started. If you're a musician, singer, or a producer, there's a reason you love music. It's because music is everything. It brings family together, and it makes us feel better about life. It makes us feel closer to God, and it makes us feel connected to each other. It makes us stronger, and it makes us more creative. It makes us feel more alive, and it makes us feel like we can do anything we put our minds to. We're going to start this program, and I predict that in no time, we'll be playing shows for our first major tour, and we'll have our own music! We're going to help each other, and we're going to give one another our best advice! We're going to learn together, and we're going to help each other learn. And we're going to have fun doing it!

It's very difficult to learn new songs and new chords in a new style. This program is very easy to use. It is very easy to learn the basic chords and basic notes in a new style.

The only problem is that there's not enough variety in the lineup.  Some of the songs are repetitive and not very interesting.  But, at least there are some good songs on this CD, and the album is worth the money at $24.99.  My only complaint is that the band seems to be going through a period of inactivity.  They haven't released any new music in over a year.  But, if they do, I'll buy it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I like this album.  It's not the greatest of rock albums, but it's not that bad.  It's a nice enough band.  I don't really like the lyrics.  They're not very clever and I find it very awkward and silly at times.  They're not very memorable either.  But the songs are great to listen to and it's well worth buying.

Amazon review:  This was a gift for my boyfriend and I.  We were both very impressed with the amount of quality material on this CD.  The quality of the songs is very good.  The guitar solos are very good.  The bassist and drummer are very talented and do a great job.  The only thing I don't like is that there are times where the band seems to be going through a period of inactivity.  I was hoping that they would put out a new album, but so far nothing.  Hopefully they will put out another one soon, because this one is really good and would be a nice addition to any rock-and-roll collection.

Amazon review:  A very good CD.  Nothing spectacular, but very good.  The songs are all pretty good.  They are all very well-written and have great hooks.  The guitar solos on this CD are very good.  The bassist and drummer are very talented.  The only thing that I don't like is that there are times when the band seems to be going through a period of inactivity.  Hopefully they will put out a new album, because this one is really good and would be a nice addition to anyone's collection.

Amazon review:  I bought this when it first came out.  I am not very experienced with music.  I thought it would be a good introduction to rock music.  I like the music, but I would not call this a true rock album.  I think this is much better than the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." The songs are all good.  The band does a nice job and has a great sound.  If you are an interested person, this CD is a good one to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is a good album.  I like the songs, but I think the band is going through some growing pains.  The songs are all good, but they are not a true rock band.

Amazon review:  This was the first CD I bought from Amazon.  It's an album I bought because I was impressed with the quality of the CD.  This is a good album, but it fails to stand out.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

I was bored and hungry so I decided to play some oldies on an old, battered, and out of tune cassette tape.

I just got my new laptop and I have been struggling to get it up to speed.  I have not had time to figure out the software yet because I am always on the phone with my company.  My boss is so damn nice to work for.  He is a great guy and I really like him.  He was a great husband and a great father.  I just wish I could have met him before I had children.  He is the greatest guy in the world.  A wonderful man.  I really hope he is in heaven!  He deserves to be with his loving family.  That is all I can say.  He is the best and I know that is true.  He is my hero and I love him dearly.  He is a wonderful man and I thank him for everything he did for me.

I want to thank my friend for being my friend.  I want to thank the entire family for making me the person I am today.  I thank my children for being such wonderful children.  I thank my friends for being my friends.  I thank my family for being my family.  I thank God for the wonderful gift that I am.  I thank my parents for being parents to me and for always being there for me.  I thank my husband for being the most wonderful man in the world.

I thank everything in the world for being wonderful.  That is all I can say.  I thank the universe for every wonderful thing that has graced my life.  I thank God for everything that is good.  I thank the earth for every wonderful thing that has graced the earth.  I thank everything in the world for being wonderful.

I thank everything in the world for being wonderful.  I thank everything in the world for being wonderful.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: I loved this album the first time I heard it when I was 13, but I have to say, I had to get this back in the library, as the library was closed and I was unable to borrow it.  I love the songs, and I was a big fan of the band, but I just feel that the album is a little too long (with songs like "Gemini" and "Jellyfish") and doesn't have the same feel as the band's earlier albums.  I agree with the people on the reviews who said that it is a little dated, and that it is a good album for a first time listener.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  This is one of the most underrated albums of the 90's.  It doesn't have the same feel as other albums by them, but it is a great example of the 80's indie music.  The music is a little different and original, and the lyrics are a little strange.  The music is a bit like a mix between the Beach Boys and the Ramones.  It's a great song, but it is quite long.  I really love the opening track "Rekindling," which was the first one I bought when it was released.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great album, and a great cover.  This is one of the few albums I have in my collection that does not have any of the songs off the CD, although most are well performed.  I have to admit, I didn't expect to like this album, but I do and I have been listening to it for a long time.  The music is a bit more electronic, and the lyrics are a little more off the wall.  I was surprised by the number of songs that were left off, but I don't miss them.  I have to say, I can listen to "The Last Night" all day long.  The music is great and the lyrics are great.  I think this album is one of the best albums of all time.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  I would recommend this CD to anyone who has an open mind and a love for good music.  The music is great, and the way the songs are performed are a perfect example of how great music should be.  The only problem I had was that the CD was a little too long to carry around in my car.  The album is well worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone who asks me.  I have no idea why this album has only 100 songs.  There are a lot of really good songs, but most of them have been released on other albums, or are not as well known.

Amazon review:  This album is sooooo fun to listen to!  The music is a lot of fun and the lyrics are a little unexpected.  I've never heard the Ramones before in my life, but I sure love this album.

I understand that they try to make this album a hip hop album; however, I just feel the lyrics are very poor and the music is average for a "Hip Hop" album. The last song is better than the album.

Amazon review: The first few tracks on this album are decent. They have a nice beat and a hook to them. The lyrics could have been better, but they aren't all that bad. The album is fairly average, but it is great for being a hip-hop album. The album is the first album where they try to bring the funk to hip-hop, and it is a good idea. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes hip-hop.  One thing that is sad about this album, is that reggie didn't have a good sound when he was with the group.  The group was mostly reggie with a few members, however, the song "funk" on the album is all reggie.  I really wish he would have a good sound back then.      
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album is a classic hip-hop album. I have listened to many hip-hop albums, and I like the most, I like to call it my favorite hip-hop album. This whole album is a great hip-hop album. I really like reggie's new style and that he really try to bring the funk to hip-hop. The album is not bad at all. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes hip-hop. This is a classic.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
