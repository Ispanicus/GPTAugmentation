Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's). It arose again (with a power chord) recently, when I started catching up on Arrested Development and rediscovered it as the theme song of the indefatigable Gob. Now it's my ringtone. Fun stuff.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

I don't have a problem with your review, but it's a bit hypocritical to compare this to a record that was released in the early 70's.

And I don't think it's fair to say that the music sounds muddy or that the vocals are inaudible.

If the vocals are inaudible, then why are they audible? Is it because the recording is muddy?

I think you are being unfair to this album.

I don't think you had much of a chance to listen to it because it was released a year after this one.

I agree with you on the recording and the vocals. I think the

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: This is a collection of recordings of the music and the brain, which was made by the musicologist Alan Lomax in the 1920s.  It is important to note that Lomax was a very successful musician who composed a lot of pieces and that he was highly regarded as a composer.  I am not sure that Lomax was the best recorder for doing his recordings, but he was a very good musician.  When he did his recordings he used a primitive record and player called a cylinder.  He used very little reverb and very little dynamic range, which resulted in a good sound.  He used a very primitive audio amplifier to amplify the record and he used a very primitive tape recorder, which recorded to a very small capacity tape.  Lomax had a very poor grasp of sound engineering.  He did not have a sound engineer, but he did have a sound engineer for his music.  For the recordings of the music and the brain he used the best recording technology available at the time, which was the mimeograph and the cylinder.  He used a very primitive tape recorder, which was very primitive and very primitive recording technology.  He did not know that the way to get more sound was to use the best recording technology at the time, which was the mimeograph and the cylinder, but he did use these technologies to make his recordings.  The recordings are not very good because he used the best recording technology available at the time.  The recordings are very interesting because they are not very good because of the poor recording technology used by Lomax.  Lomax had great respect for his work and he used to say that he wished that he had a recorder that recorded to the best tape technology at the time.  Lomax was very much a man of his time, and he used the best technology available during the time that he recorded his work.  He did not have the best technology available at the time, but he did have the best technology available at the time.

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: Love this album!  Heard an interview with her on WRNI public radio when the album was released.  They played several tracks and I had to buy the CD immediately - and I was not disappointed.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I really like All Alone with Something to Say.  If you dig Bonnie you can't go wrong with this album.

Amazon review: I have heard about this album but I am so new to the whole online review thing that I didn't really know what to expect.  I was blown away by the album.  The quality of the songs and mixes is great and even though it is a bit dated now, I still feel its good.  I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and they are very easy to listen to.  Not to mention the fact that the songs are all mixed so well together.  I have to believe that if you play this album loud enough you will get the best out of it.  I have a few friends that are avid fans and they all gave me their opinions and when I told them that I had heard this album and they could listen to it, they each said it sounded great and that it would be an easy listening for them at work.  All in all I would have to say that this is a great album and I will definitely re-listen to it again.  I have had it for about 30 days and have been listening to it non stop.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: So many great tracks.  Some are classic Bonnie, some are new - and some are so hard to pick between.  But I am a big fan of this band and I believe that Love is the word.  I wish I could have heard this album when I was younger.  Now I have to see if I can listen to it again, as it is being re-released to all of the major online music sellers.  Its only been out for a few months.  But so many great tracks.  I love the mix of songs that are on this album.  I wish I could play it on the piano, but I don't have a piano.  I just need to find a good piano to practice on.  This is definitely a great band.

Amazon review: This is a collection of rare, hard to find, and previously unrecorded songs from the early years of Bonnie Raitt.  It is a collection of songs from the mid to late 70s that have never been released on any of her albums.  This is an amazing album.  All of the songs are great.  I really love the song All Alone with Something to Say and the song How Much is Enough.  Most of the songs have an energy that is so hard to find in today's music.  It is just a great mix of old and new songs.  The sound quality is also nice on this album.  If you like Bonnie and want to hear some of her classics, this is definately recommended.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have heard many great songs on Bonnie Raitt's albums, but this is the only one that I have heard that is complete.  This is a great album and I can't believe the price.  I have to agree with the other reviews.  This is the best album the artist has ever put out.  I love it!

I love to read the comments.
If you have feedback about this or any other album, please post your comments here.

This is my favorite Bonnie Raitt album.  I have many, many favorites, but this is the one I can always count on and that is why it is my number one album.  I love the song All Alone with Something to Say, the song Never Gonna Fall in Love Again, the song Something in the Way You Make Me Feel, and the song You're So Fine.  I also love the song Blue Moon, the song What Comes Around Comes Around, and the song I Need You.  I just love this album.  I can't wait to hear it again.  It is great.  I am sad that I can't listen to it until it is re-released.  It is one of my all time favorites.  It deserves to be on all the major music stores.

This album is one of my favorites.  The music is great and the lyrics are great.  Some songs are great and some are not as great, but they are all great.  I love the album and I hope it is re-released so I can buy it over and over again.  I feel like I am sitting in a room with my friends and we are all listening to this album.  It's a great album.  I love the song How Much is Enough, the song I Need You, the song Never Gonna Fall in

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.

Amazon review:  This song is an emotional roller coaster.  The first couple of times you can hear the song, you'll be fine.  It's not until the chorus comes in that you get turned off.  I was very turned off by the lyrics.  I find it very insulting when someone thinks they can get away with what they did.  I just don't agree with it.  I don't think you should have to apologize for your actions.  You don't have to forgive anyone for what they've done to you.  I think it's very important to let the other person know what you thought of them.  Even if it is a song.  Even if they're a complete jerk.  Just tell them you just don't agree with what they did.  It doesn't make you right, but it doesn't make them wrong either.  Just know what you think.  I love the way it is written.  You don't have to sing it, it's just one of my favorites.  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If I could, I would do this song over a thousand times.  The fact that it's an acoustic version makes it even better.  I love that it's acoustic, the intro is just perfect and the guitar and the backing vocals blend perfectly.  I don't like the way the guitar sounds too loud, but that's just me.  It's not a very heavy song, but it's a slow ballad.  
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I saw this on the radio and instantly fell in love with this song.  I'm a country music fan, and this song is just amazing.  The lyrics are so beautiful and I love how they match the music.  The chorus is so sweet, and I love the fact that it's a slow ballad.  I couldn't believe how good it is.  I was so surprised when I first heard it and felt like I fell in love.  I love it.  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: A+  This song is a perfect compliment to the band's first two albums.  I love how the song just kind of starts, and just builds and builds from there.  It's not super heavy, and it doesn't really have a hook.  The first four or five times I heard it, I couldn't really sing it.  But after I heard it a few more times, I really started to love it.  
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon Review: I'm sorry, but this song is not for me.  It's one of those songs where I don't really feel like I 'got' it.  I don't really have any negative feelings towards this song, but it's just not for me.  I could see it working, but I just don't feel that it's a good fit.  
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a great song.  I'm a huge fan of the band, and this is just one of the best songs that they've ever written.  I've listened to it many times, and I've never been able to pick out just one song that really stands out to me.

Amazon review: The song's about moving on with your life, and the lyrics are about how you can't be alone.  I don't think the song is particularly good, but I really like it.

Amazon review: Sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold" but not as good. The beat is annoying, and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this. I thought he was a "rocker" (an image he portrayed on Idol), and this is far from rock. Not a big fan of this song that I've heard many times before.

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Lyrics

Allan Boles

I've got a voice that's a bit raspy, but I'm a singer and I love to sing.
I've got a voice that's a bit raspy, I love to sing.
I've got a voice that's a little bit raspy, I love to sing.
I've got my voice and I sing well, I love to sing.
I sing with no backing tracks, and I sing with no backing tracks.
I sing with no backing tracks, and I sing with no back-track.
I'm here to sing, I'm here to sing, I'm here to sing, I'm here.
I'm here to sing, I'm here to sing, and I sing well, I love to sing.
I love to sing, I love to sing, and I sing well, I love to sing.
How do you work this?
How do you work this?
How do you work this? I've got a voice that's a bit raspy.
I've got my voice and it's a little bit raspy, but I love to sing.
I've got my voice, I've got my voice, I sing well, but I love to sing.
I sing with no backing tracks, and no backing tracks.
I sing with no backing tracks, and no backing tracks. I sing with no backing tracks.
I'm here to sing, I'm here to sing, but I love to sing.
I love to sing, I love to love to sing, and I love to sing.

Allan Boles

I've got a voice that is a bit raspy, but I'm a singer and I love it.
I've got a voice that is a bit raspy, I love it.
I've got a voice that's a little bit raspier, I love it.
I've got my voice and I sing well, I love it.
I sing with no backing tracks, and I sing with no backup tracks.
I sing with no backing tracks, and I sing with  no back tracking.
I'm here to sing, I'm here to sing, no backing tracks, no back tracking. I sing with no backing tracks, and no backing tracks.
I'm here to sing, just me singing, just me singing, just me singing.
I love to sing, I love to sing, and I love to sing, but I love to sing.

Amazon review: If you enjoy listening to great songs that aren't necessarily country, this album is your kind of stuff.  For example, "I Know Where" is a great song, "I Wish I Could Take Losing You Back" is great, "I Wish I Could Take Losing You Back" is a beautiful song, "You're Not Alone" is great, and "You're Not alone" is great, and the rest of the songs are great.

I am a fan of Dave Clark Five. I love the way they wrote some of their songs especially "I'll Be Around" and "I'm A Loser" and the way the band sounded. The last two albums I purchased were their last two albums. I do not think they can make a better album after this one.

There are two other songs that I really like on this album. Two of my favorites on this album are "I'm A Loser" and "I'll Be Around."

One of the best rock bands ever to come out of the late sixties/early seventies.

I have been a fan of this band for as long as I remember. The Dave Clark Five are one of the greatest rock bands I have ever heard. They were one of the last rock bands before the "blues" movement, and they still sound like they were playing blues. They were one of the first to put out albums that were not straight-ahead blues. They put out albums like "The Dave Clark Five," "Dangerous Dave Clark Five," "On the Sunny Side of the Street," and "Tune Up." They never played the same songs twice. They used the same musicians each time. They were a very diverse band. They played everything from punk rock to folk rock to bluegrass to jazz to soul to country to gospel to rock to blues. They were not a pop band. They never tried to be one. They were not one of the first to put out albums like this. They were not a pop band. They were not one of the first to put out albums like this, but they did have some of the most unique and memorable songs ever recorded and are among the best to put out for a long time. They were the first real blues-rock band. They were the first band to put out an album that had songs from the sixties and seventies. They were one of the first bands to mix the blues with rock and roll in such a way that made you feel like you were listening to a real rock band, not just some kind of blues band. They were among the first real rock bands. They were the first band to put out an album that had songs like "I Love You So Much" which is a song that was played on the radio for years before anybody even heard it or thought of it as a rock song.

The Dave Clark Five were the most influential and original band in the history of rock, blues, and soul. They were not just a band that played blues, they were one of the first blues bands to combine rock and roll with blues and jazz to create something even more exciting and new. They were not just a band that played blues, they were one the first to put out an album that had songs like "I Love You So much" that were played on the radio for years before anybody even heard it or thought of that song as a rock song. I remember hearing the song for the first time on the radio and thinking to myself, "This is what I want to do." It was not as innovative as Cream, but it was still a great song. It was not the first rock song to have lyrics like "I love you so much" but it is among the best rock songs of the time. It was not the first rock song to have lyrics like "I Love You So Much" but it is among the best rock songs of the time. The Dave Clark Five were one of the first bands to put out an album that combined many different types of music to create something that was so unique and new.
