Amazon review: So I have been listening to the Death Cab for Cutie song "Vaseline" again and again.  This song is just too good to be true.  It has the most beautiful lyrics you will ever hear.  The guitar is perfect, the bass is just perfect, and the vocals are the perfect blend of high and low notes.  It really makes me want to buy the album.  I think this is their best work to date.  This is without a doubt one of the best songs I have ever heard.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think it's a shame that this song was not put out earlier.  It's a much better song than the one that was released.  The lyrics are fantastic and the music is amazing.  I love the use of the word "wasted" in the lyrics.  That's some good poetry.  I love the way the music is put together.  The bass is perfect.  The lyrics are just so damn powerful.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The lyrics are so strong I can't even describe them.  The lyrics actually make me want to be a writer as well.  I can't even find the words to describe how powerful they are.  Just listen to them.  They really suck you in.  I can't even describe them in words.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great song.  I think the lyrics are the best I have heard them so far.  The only thing I don't like is all the yelling, but that's probably normal.  I don't really care about the yelling.  The lyrics are the best I have ever heard them.  I think this song is going to be huge.  The best song on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't care if you are a hipster.  I understand the whole love your neighbor mentality.  But, I don't like the way the song is written.  I don't like how the song starts...I don't like how the song ends.  It's just not fun.  It's just not enjoyable.  I don't like the way the song ends.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I don' know what happened with "I'm Not A Robot" but the song is gone.  I am sorry it's gone, but I am glad I listened to it.  I don't know how to explain it.  It was a very good song.  I love it.  It's just that the song was too good to be true.  It was a perfect love song.  I just wanted to be a part of it.  But things didn't work out.  So the song is gone.  This song is a great song.  Just a pity it's gone.  It was a perfect love song.  I just wish it was there.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really thought "I Am Mine" would be a big deal, but like most new Death Cab songs its not.  The production is nice and everything is kind of in the right place.  But I don't even know how to describe it.  It's just a very nice song with a good hook.  I really like the lyrics.  The song is just a really nice song.  I don't know what happened, but it's gone.  It was a nice little love song.  I am sure there are better songs out there, but I don't know any.  I can't even find a good description of it.  It's just gone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's a cool song, but I don't really like the lyrics.  It kind of sounds like something a 12 year old would write.  I don't know who you are, but I don't like the lyrics.  It's kind of a dumb song.  It's just a dumb song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this is the best song on the album.  It has great lyrics.  It's a great song.  The guitar is also great.  The bass is really cool.  The drums are really cool.  Everything is great.  I like it.  I like it a lot, but the lyrics don't really make any sense.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

I'd also like to see that movie again, but it's been a long time since I've seen it.  I've seen the movie a few times, but I think that's about it.  Maybe I missed some of the songs.  I'm not sure.

The song is great, but I wish I don't have to listen to the lyrics.  It's just so annoying.  I don't mind the lyrics so much, but the song is really boring in the beginning and halfway through the song and it just doesn't have that certain sound that some people like.

Mamma Mia! is the original musical based on the movie of the same name, which was based on the songs from the movie, and is also based on the idea of a musical about young love. The musical was produced and directed by Tim Rice (Hairspray) and produced by Cameron Mackintosh who also wrote the book for the musical.

The musical was originally staged in London in 2002. There were plans to move the production to New York City. However, the musical took a three-year break to allow the filmmakers to make changes to the production. In 2006, the musical was set to premiere in New York City. The original Broadway production played for 3 years in the West End and Off-Broadway and was nominated for a Tony Award in 2006. The musical closed in 2007.

The musical is based on the idea of Mamma Mia! and there are many songs from the movie, which are used here. Many of them are sung in

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: This is a song about a woman who is in a bad relationship and can't find love. She's got money, she's got a job, she's got some nice clothes. But she can't find love. But that's what the song is about. That's what the song is about. You can tell from the lyrics, they are about a person who is living in a fantasy world. If the woman were real, she would have been able to find love. But she's not really living in a real world. She's living in a fantasy world. But I don't know what to say. This song is perfect.

Amazon review: Well, this is a song about a guy who's in a relationship with a girl and he's been with her for a couple of years and all she's giving him is that she loves him. He's been trying so hard to be with her. And he can't seem to get that feeling, that feeling of love. So he's been telling her that he loves her a lot. And the song is about that feeling. And I think when this song was made, there were a lot of people who were in love with each other and they were in a relationship, and they got married, and they were best friends. And they'd been together for several years. And they'd been together for four years before they had a kid together. And they'd gone through so many things together, and they both loved each other and both needed to be with each other at the same time. And that's the love song for which I wrote this song.

Amazon review: This is about a girl who knows she's going to be married, and she wants to have a little fun. She goes to the beach, she goes to the mall. She sees a guy walking by. She goes up to him and says, "Hey, would you mind taking a picture with me?" And he's like, "Okay." So she takes his picture and then she goes outside to the beach and sits down and she starts crying. She cries. And she tells her friend, her best friend, she tells her, "I'm pregnant." And she starts crying. And then he shows up on her doorstep, and he's like, "Hey, are you okay?" And she says, "Yeah, I'm fine." He says, "I'm sorry to hear that." And then he leaves. It's a sad song. It's really sad. I don't think it's a very good song.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

I thought the vocals were going to be better, but I was pleased to find out that they are not.  What really gets me are the songs that don't really sound like Leonard Cohen at all, songs such as "Love Letter", "Oceans", "The Wrecking Crew", "If I Ever Lose My Faith in You", "The Man Who Sold the World", "The Stranger", "The Man Who Sold the World", "Piano Lesson", and "The Stranger".  This album is a collection of songs that don't add up to anything and don't even try to.  I can't say I'm sorry to Leonard Cohen.  He's a great writer and musician.  But this is just a collection of songs that don't make sense.  Don't waste your money on this one.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

I never knew I could connect with such a huge number of people in one night.

It's been a year since the last concert I attended, and I can't believe it has already been a year since the last time I left the comfort of my bed and headed to a concert.

I can't believe that I've been a part of hundreds of thousands of people's lives, and I've been able to do that.  It's incredible.

I can't believe that I've never been to a concert in my entire life.

I can't believe that I've never been to a show of this magnitude.

But I have, and it has been amazing.  People come to my concerts because they love my music.  They've been inspired by my music.  They've been touched by my music.  They've been moved in a way that they haven't been before.

This is a story about a woman named Whitney Houston who is a legend that you should know.  She will forever be remembered for her inspirational career and her music.

I'm not going to talk about her musical career.  I'm not going to talk about

The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.

The only problem was that the music was not playing correctly, and I had to turn the CD player off and on in order to get it to play.  That made it very annoying, and I gave it back to him.  He offered to send me a new CD, and I told him I would not buy anything from him again.  Now, months later, I am getting the CDs back, and I am very happy that they are in good condition.  I am very glad I got to the bottom of this problem, and now I will not buy anything from this company again.  This is a very unprofessional company.  Their service is not worth their price.

I found this on Amazon but I wanted to say that I would have rather bought this album by The Band or anyones else, than this one by Switchfoot. I am very dissapointed in this one and this is the first album I have bought on here that I have been dissapointed in. I would have rather spend the money on a album by a lesser known band.

I bought this album because I loved the songs in it. I love them all and I love the band. I've listened to them since the day that I read the review that it was on the first day of release, and I've listened to it over and over and over and over again.

I want to make it clear that I am a Switchfoot fan and I love them. I love everything about them and I love their music. I really do. And this album is a great album. I don't think it would have been the same if they had done anything else. If I had bought this instead of any of their other albums, I'd probably still be a fan.

I love their music but I have a few issues with this one.

1. The songs are awesome. The band is awesome. The songs are really good. But the lyrics are really bad. You can't believe how bad they are. They are bad. Bad bad bad bad. I don't see how any of this is ever going to make a hit and make it onto an album. This album is a mess.

2. The lyrics are horrible. I can't stand them. And I don't care how many times I hear "I'm so glad you're dead" or "I hope you never get out of jail" or "I hope you never get out of the car". That is not a good song. That is a terrible song. That is not a song that should be on any album. It doesn't even fit on this album.
