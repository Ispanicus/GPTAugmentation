Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I can't believe this wasn't on the radio.  This is a great song. It's loud, and I didn't know this was even on the radio.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this record thinking it was going to be something like a re-make of his earlier work. This record is so much better. I was expecting more of the same. The sound quality is great, the songwriting is great, the production is excellent, but what really makes this record stand out is the vocal performance. It's very nice to hear someone singing so well. The songs are short and sweet, but not too short. There are some songs where they could have been longer, but this is a CD that you can slip in any car or carry in a pocket. The album is a great step in the right direction for Josh. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have been listening to it all day and this song is one of my favorites. I wish he would do more of these type of songs. The vocals are so smooth and beautiful. The production is amazing, but I think the lyrics are a bit on the lame side. The best part is when he sings, "I love you, baby, I love you, baby, I just love you. " These lyrics are so meaningful. He is a great singer, and he can really sing. He is not a great singer, but he can sing.

Amazon review:  This is the only song I listen to when I am in the mood for a good old gospel tune - even though I enjoy Gospel music as much as the next guy.  I love it when I am in a bar and there is a song playing that I know I need to hear.  This is a classic "all I need is a song" song, and is a good indication that you probably have a great group of guys at your place, and just need a little encouragement to get the party started!  I have sung this song to my friends since the first time I heard it.  And, I will continue to sing this song to all my friends until the end of time.  I would highly recommend this song to any guy or gal looking for a great song to start a party with.  - B. B.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Love the song, but I just don't care for the album.  You'd think with the amount of time that went into this album, they could have chosen a less generic song.  What's the point?  And why does this album, which can't hold a candle to the "collide" album, always make me feel like I'm not listening to any of the songs?  It's like they just throw in whatever they have the album's to offer, like you didn't hear any of the new songs the night before.  The most generic song in the album is "I'm Your Man", and the worst song is "All I Want Is You".  And "Collide" is just as bland as the other songs.  I'll pass on this one.  "Rise" is much better.

Amazon review: I was lucky enough to be able to get a copy of this album for a friend.  The only reason I'm rating it so low is because I had a hard time getting through it.  I didn't really like the music in it, but I wasn't a fan of what was playing.  The album is good for a few songs, but overall, I haven't been able to put it down to listen to it for days.

Amazon review: This is a very good album by a very good band.  The songs are well-written and the musicianship is top notch.  What I love the most about this album is that it's not just a collection of songs, it's a compilation of the best of the best.  "Innocent" is a great song.  "Collide" is a good song.  "Innocent" and "Collide" are two of my favourite songs from this album.  "Collide" however is the best song on the album.  "Collide" is a song written by Josh Groban, a song that I always hear on the radio.  And I love it.

Amazon review: Josh Groban is the greatest singer.  "All I Want Is You" is the best song on this album.  It's hard to pick a favourite song.  I like them all, but I'll listen to "All I Want Is You" from this album a lot.  It's an awesome song.  "Collide" is a song that I always sing at my friend's weddings.  And I always love it.  All the songs are very good.  I wouldn't say that this album is perfect, but I would say that this album is a very good effort.

Amazon review: I don't know what else to say.  This album is just so good.  If you're a Josh Groban fan, you will love this album.  The album is filled with great songs, and the songs on it are all very good.  But the thing that makes this album great is the fact that it's a compilation of songs that are great.  This album is filled with great songs, and they just happen to be all songs by Josh Groban.  It's a great album, and I couldn't imagine a better album to celebrate Josh Groban's 50th birthday.  The album is filled with great songs, and they just happen to be all Josh Groban.  This album is filled with great songs, and they just happen all songs by Josh Groban.

Amazon review: This album, by far, was the best album I have ever heard.  I love it.  And I have to say... I think that I enjoyed this album more than my last.  The songs just seemed better, with more energy.  It was a little more pop than my last, but more rock, as well.  There are some pretty good songs on this album.  I can't really say which are the best songs, but I can say that there are a few really good songs on here.  Most of the songs are great, but there are some that are just ok.

I have been listening to the CD and love it, but she is not so sure.  The CD has been on for over a year and she has never liked the songs on it.  Do you have any idea of what to do about this problem.  I know I can't buy the CD, because I already have one, but I can't sell her the non-working CD.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon.com Review: Billy Currington - The Longest Way Home CD

by John from baltimore, MD USA

I just finished listening to the Billy Currington - The Longest Way Home CD (which I bought from a local store) and I must say it is a great listen. I really enjoyed this CD. It was interesting and it made me smile. The songs were a little different and it was interesting to listen to each song. I wish I could have bought the album on vinyl! I hope that I can find more of his music.

I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good hard driving rock n roll song. This is the music that my parents listened to when I was a kid and it was the music they played in our living room. I have also listened to it while driving my car and I have always enjoyed the sound of the car engine and the sound of the tires on the road as it races along. That is the kind of music that I like. The songs are different from each other and they are good. I wish that I could have bought the CD on vinyl! That would have been much better.

I don't think that the music is really very good but hey, it's Billy Currington! I would recommend this to anyone who loves a hard driving rock n roll song.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: This is the second product I have used to create a better state of mind and space in which to think. The first is a meditation CD by a very good friend of mine. It is called "The Art of Living" and the music is quite good. The music is very relaxing and allows the mind to be at peace. The only problem is that it is on a CD. The main reason I bought this product is because I wanted to create more space for thinking and creativity. I have not noticed much of any effect yet. I use this product three to four times a week. I am not a big believer in meditation, but this product seems to have helped me in this way.

Amazon review: There are some interesting videos on the internet that you might like. I have found that some of these videos can be beneficial to your mind. The first one I got was the first video on the internet by a guy named Rick Warren. It is called the "Power of Service" ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR9nYiH7qG8 ) I watched it several times and found that it was very helpful to me. I think that he is doing a good job of teaching the concept of service. He is talking about how people are not just selfish but that they should be thinking as a group and putting out their best effort for the benefit of the greater good. He is also taking this idea to another level and teaching his listeners how to use their God given talents and abilities.

Amazon review: This product has been very useful to me. It has helped me in creating a certain state of mind that I have not been able to create before. I am using it during a time where I am not in a very good mental state. I am just very stressed out at the moment. I have been using this product for two weeks now and I have already noticed a difference. I am now able to create a better state of mind and I am creating more space for thinking. This product has helped me in creating space for creativity and concentration. I have also noticed that I have been able to create a better mood and outlook on my life. I have not felt depressed or worried before but now I am able to see the positive side of things. The product has helped me to find my inner strength and a few times I have said that at times I feel like a child, who has failed at the school and is now crying about something that didn't go well. I feel that this product has helped me to develop a better attitude towards life and I have more clarity and clarity is about life. I am able to see what is important to me and what is not.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an older song.  The version of the song is not at all what I would consider a "classic".  To me, it is a bit of a rip-off of the "Blue Christmas" (an instrumental version from the movie, "White Christmas") and the "Blue Jean" by the Beach Boys.  I understand that the song is from a different album but it just seems to have been poorly recorded to me.  I did enjoy the song though.  It sounds like a Christmas classic to me.

Nice Christmas cd

I've been listening to this album for about 3 days now.  It's not the kind of music I usually listen to, but I was glad I bought it because I got into it easily. It's not like I'm a Christmas music junkie... It's more "I'd like to listen to this in the car while driving to work" type of music.

I bought this because I thought this album would be decent, but wasn't expecting it to be this good.  It's a great collection of Christmas songs.  I have not listened to the entire album yet, just a few songs so far.

I've written my review of the album here:
http://www.nolab.com/review/christmas-time-is-here

This album is great.  I don't get the "classic" Christmas albums like I used to.  I want to listen to Christmas music, not just "the same old thing", but I don't want to listen to the same old things year after year.  I want to hear the new stuff that's coming out.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

I have been listening to this album since I was in elementary school. I really like this album. I like the lyrics, I like the instrumentals and the guitar playing. I like the way Cher sings. I also like the fact that she is now being called the "Queen of R&B". Now that I am older, I really think that she is the best. I really love the love song. I'm not very impressed with the original version of Love Song. It is still really good.



One of Cher's best songs along with You're So Vain, and I'd rather believe in you and I'd Rather Die. I like the first one because I'm sure Cher thinks she is great, and I feel she is right, and I think it is really funny. I just like the first one, and I like the second one, and I like the third one. I really like the third one because of the lyrics.



I just don't understand why people have this reaction to this album. It is not bad. It is really good, and it is still better than the original CD version. The original CD version has great lyrics, and great instrumentals. It has great guitar playing, and good vocals. I have heard about the original version of Love Song, and I really think that it is amazing. It is very well-written, and I like it very much. It is very good to listen to. I wish I could hear it live. I really like the original album. I like the first, second and third ones. I really like those three songs a lot. I don't know why people have a problem with this album, and I don't really like the album. I think the original CD album is still the best. I don't know why people have a problem with it. I really like this album, and I really like the original version of Love Song. I really like this album.
