Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: The asinine politics gets in the way of the music. I listened to this CD at a neighborhood party and had to comment. I would not consider buying it even though Ry Cooder has enormous MUSICAL talent and I have some of his other editions. Hey Ry, stick to music for everyone.

Amazon review: This CD is the definition of generic. I have about 5 albums by this band and I cannot remember the last time I heard anything original. This CD is generic, boring and unlistenable.

Amazon review: This band is a little bit generic, but the music is good. This band is one of those bands that is hard to find. This band is one of those bands that you will hear at your local church. This band is a new band, but I have heard them before. The only problem is that these guys have to go and sing on a song that is just not sung well. The song is called "Let it Go" by John Lennon. This song was never sung well by The Beatles. The band does the song justice.

You may want to print this out and give it to the worship leader at your church. This is a quick & easy way to get people to purchase their CD and for the band to promote the CD.

Overall, it's a great album.  It's not quite a hit, but it does get some play.  It has a great hook and a great beat.

I would say it's a good pick for a club night or for parties.  I did get a little more of a reaction from the DJs than I was hoping for.

I just don't think it would be that great for a club setting.  Overall, this is a great dance album.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review:  This is a very good sounding album.  I'm a big fan of Cher's music.  I was very disappointed to find out that she didn't include much of her original arrangement on this album.  She should have left some of the original arrangement on this album.  At the same time, she did an excellent job of singing these songs.  I'm really happy to have this album.

Amazon review:  If you like Cher, you'll love Cher.  If you like Cher, you will love this album.  It is not only a good record, it is one of the best records of all time.  The vocals are excellent.

Amazon review:  Cher's music is a little on the soft and mushy side.  This is a very good record, but I found it a little bit on the soft side.  She sings the songs with a very soft voice and is very sweet.  The "Rhodes Piano" does a nice job of softening the sound.  Most of the songs are very nice and the album is very good.  The piano is very nice and the vocal arrangements are very nice.  The arrangements are good, but I find the vocals on this album to be a little on the soft side.  I could have done without the slow songs.  The "Rhodes Piano" is a nice touch.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: this is a great album, and it is a good album for both sexes. I would like to see it on a reissue with the old version of this album. Its a great album, but I do not want to hear it as it was, just as a reissue of a classic album.

This is a very good album and i would recommend it. The first album was great, but now its great again.

This album is in my opinion one of the best albums ever. There is really not much to dislike and everything to appreciate. I agree with the other reviewer, it has really gotten better since the first album. Not all the songs on this are great, but there is alot of the original and it is also one of the most enjoyable albums to listen to.

The only thing that I don't like about this album is the cover. It is kind of ugly. I would rather have a good cover than a bad one.

This album is without a doubt one of my favorite albums of all time. I like the instrumentation, the lyrics, the vocals, the production. The only thing I don't like about this album is the cover. It looks more like a college yearbook then something professional.

This album is great, I listen to it every night before I go to sleep. Every song is great. The only bad thing about it is the cover on the back. It looks like a yearbook. But I don't care if it looks like a yearbook, I love it.

I have listened to this album literally every day for four years now. I love the album, and all of the songs are great. I really wish it had been released in a different CD format. It is a great album.

This album has got to be one of the best albums of all time. The music is great, the lyrics are great and the production is great.

I love this album and I am going to list the 5 most incredible songs on this album.

1. The Song of the Year - Live at the Beacon Theater (The Band plays their first live concert)

2. The Longest Song I've Ever Heard - New York, New York (The Band plays a song which is longer than the song you play on your phone)

3. I'm Gonna Let You Know (I Want You) - The Longest Song I've Ever Heard (The Band plays their first live concert)

4. When the Music's Over - New York, New York (The Band plays their first live concert)

5. The Song of the Night - The Longest Song I've Ever Heard (The Band plays their second live concert)

I love this album and I am going to list the 5 greatest songs on this album.

1. I'm Gonna Let You Know.

2. The Longest Song I've Ever Heard.

3. The Song of the Night.

4. When the Music's Over.

5. The Song of the Year.

I wish I could give an opinion on this album. I thought the first album was good but this album was the best. I like the production of this album a lot. It's the best album I have ever listened to.

This album is really good. I like it. The production is great. The instrumentation is great.

This is one of my favorites. I would say it is a 4 out of 5 stars. The production is great and the songwriting is amazing. I would say this is one of the best albums of all time.

I have listened to this album literally every day for four and a half years now. I love the album, and all of the songs are good. I really wish it had been released in a different CD format.

This album is great, I listen to it every night. Every song is great. The only bad thing about it is the album cover, it's ugly. I would rather have a good cover than a bad one. I love this album.

This album is great, I listen to it every night, and every song is great. The only bad thing about it is the cover. It looks like a college yearbook, but I don't care if it looks like a college yearbook. I love this album.

I have listened to this album literally every day for four year now. I love the album, and all of the songs are great, but I wish it would come in a different format. It is a great album.

This album is so good, but I wish it would come in a different format. It's a great album.

With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust, I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients. Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm disappointed. I was really looking forward to this album. I have been a fan of Jethro Tull for a long time and now I find myself disappointed. I guess some of the songs are not his own. The songs are not bad, but they're not Jethro Tull. The songs are just not his.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this album hoping it would be the best Jethro Tull album ever. I was very disappointed to find out it was not. The main reason I bought the album was due to the inclusion of Bob Dylan's song "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down." I was really looking forward to hearing the rest of the album. It was a disappointment.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have been listening to them for years. I always wanted to buy a Jethro Tull album but never could. This album is going to be an absolute delight for me. I am sure Bob Dylan won't be happy either. I am very glad that I have found this album. I have a few more albums to listen to but this one will be the only one I will buy.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this as an early Christmas present, and I couldn't be more happy with my decision. The first time I heard this album was in the car with my youngest daughter, who sang along with the song "In the Garden," which made me very happy. I have since been listening to the album every day. I like the songs that are upbeat and the songs that make me think about life. My favorite track is "Darling Boy," and my least favorite is "The Last Waltz." The album has a definite feel of "The Best of" with the added bonus of "The Last Waltz."
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of the Jethro Tull I have been since they first came out. This album is not as good as the first one. I think it is like a step back by the amount of songs they put on it. The songs are okay but they are not the best songs I have heard from Jethro Tull.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is my favorite album. I love it, and I really love Bob Dylan and his songs. I have been listening to this album for a few weeks now and I love it.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

I have the original of the album but it is in the "I've Been a Big BoC Fan Since the 1970s" box set. It was one of my favorite BOC albums, but I was not able to find a copy of it online so I ordered this CD instead. It is a nice listen, and is much better than the original.

I've seen many online comments about it being soo great, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. I had to buy it when it came out, as I'd never heard of it. It's been on my iPod since, and I think I've listened to it twice.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

I love the guitar strumming and the way the vocals are mixed, but when it comes to the singing, I think some parts are a little too high when it comes to the singing. It's not that bad, I just think some songs need some more low end. Otherwise I think this is a great album.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.  I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the show out there.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: I have been searching for a good copy of this CD for years.  I finally stumbled upon a listing on ebay.  I didn't buy it, but was really happy to see it there.  The CD itself is just as I remember it--I purchased it in 1990.  A little "dusted off."  The best CD of the year.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a good album, I would say, if you're looking for a good rap/metal album.  I haven't heard all of the songs, but as far as I understand it, that is what this album consists of.  "The Laundry Service" is a real song, as I remember it from listening to this CD.  I haven't listened to the CD in a while, but I am familiar with what I remember from listening to it.  I thought the album was good in the beginning, but I have lost interest in it.

Amazon review: This album is a classic.  It has the same quality as the version that was on the soundtrack to the movie "The Wizard of Oz" except that it is much much better than that version.

Amazon review: This is a must-have for all those who like classic rock.  It is not a new release but is a re-issue of a classic.  The tracks that I liked the best are the opening "The Laundry Service" and the closing "Honey, Honey, Honey".  "The Laundry Service" is great.  The CD sounds great.  I would describe it as a combination of the electric version and the original album.  The electric version is the best in my opinion.  "Honey, Honey, Honey" is good, but I would have liked a live version.  I also like the song "Lola's Theme".  I haven't listened to this CD in a long time but I remember that it was pretty good.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys classic rock.  The CD is only $12.99.

Amazon review: I really like this album.  It is a classic rock album.  The music is a bit cheesy, but I would say that it is also very good.  The CD itself is pretty good.  They have a great cover of "Dancing in the Street" with a really nice vocal performance.  The CD itself has one track I really like: "The Laundry Service" (a very good song by the way).  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes classic rock and maybe even to those who are a bit nostalgic about the 80s.  The cover is nice.  This CD is only $12.99.  The CD is only $12.99.
