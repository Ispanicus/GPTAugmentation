Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I found this album to be the weakest of the three I listened to in the past. It is a bit like Sgt.

I'm not sure why it was released on CD, but I can see why it was released on LP.

Amazon review: My all time favorite Prince album. When I was in high school, I was given 4 of his albums, one in a cardboard box one on cassette and the others in a box. In high school, I was told by the school to listen to Prince. I never listened until I was 30. Then I listened to the albums and I loved them all. Today, I still listen to them. I listen to them everyday. I have so many of his albums in my car and they play in my car. They play in all my cars. I have a CD player in my car.

###
Amazon review: I have to say the song was good.  It's not a bad song, but it's not a great song either.  What really stands out is the lyrics.  The lyrics aren't anything like other songs that I have heard from Toni Braxton, and she's definitely not singing them herself.  I don't know how she came up with them.  Also, I don't understand why she changed the song title to "In Time" instead of "Time."  I'm guessing it's to make it sound a little different from other songs she's sung before.  But, all that aside, the song is quite good.  The lyrics are quite good, in fact.  But, the music isn't as good as the lyrics.  What really makes this song is the vocalist.  Toni Braxton is a fantastic singer and has great vocals in almost all of her songs.  I'm just not sure why she would have changed the song title to "Time" instead of "In Time."  It seems so strange to me.  I'm not sure how she could have come up with such a strange title.  I have heard a lot of songs that have similar titles as her other songs, but this one is different enough that it makes it stand out from the rest.  It's like the title has a special meaning that is not obvious.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This song has a little bit of everything that you'll hear on the album, including the guitar, the drums, and the vocal.  It is also quite different from the last album that I've heard from Toni.  This has an incredibly smooth, rich sound that makes the song sound very organic and natural.  I have to say, this song is one of my favorites.  It is a wonderful song, and it has a lot of energy to it as well.  It has a lot of energy because of the guitar chords and the drumming.  The vocal is also very good.  It has a very powerful sound to it, and it's very powerful as well.  The song is very nice.  It's one of my favorites on this album.  It's not my favorite song, but it's not my least favorite either.  It's good.  I'm just not sure why it was changed from "In Time" to "Time."  Maybe it's because "In Time" was a little more of a downer than "Time."  I don't know.  All I know is that I really like this song.  It's good.  It's a good song.  I have to say that the vocals are good.  The vocals sound very powerful, and they are very powerful in this song as well.  The guitar is very nice.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Jojo" is a great song, but the other songs are just filler, with just filler lyrics.  The music itself is decent, but doesn't take you on a journey.  It is like listening to the same song a million times, but with completely different lyrics.  I really like the song, but the lyrics to the other songs are just not that good.  I'm sure you can tell who I am talking about.  I have listened to all of the songs and I'm definitely not going to buy this.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great song. I love it! The vocals are great! The lyrics are pretty good! The music is good! I would listen to this again and again.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  It is the best version of the song "Sugar" that I have ever heard.  The song "I'll Remember You" reminds me of some of the best songs of the mid-sixties, in that it has a great melody, a very tender love song, yet the message is universal.  The song "I'm Not the Only One" is very powerful.  I hope that one day, Jojo will be able to write a song like this for someone, and never know that he/she has been alone.  I feel that music should be universal and open to all people.  It is a very important message.  I am glad that Jojo was able to sing this song.  I have a feeling that he would have written many others.  One day he will.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The best thing about JoJo's voice, is that it is a very good singer. (I have heard some awful singers, but JoJo's voice is not one of them).  Although he has a small voice, his voice is strong, and he does not have to strain to do it correctly.  He can get the highest notes, and he can sing very high, yet low.  I can imagine him singing a song like "Crawling from the Grave" with his voice going through the roof.  That is one of my favorite songs of all time, and has been for many years, but for some reason, it took me a while to get into it.  I have listened to JoJo's music since he was a kid.  I just fell in love with his voice.  It is wonderful.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Jo JO's voice is excellent!! I love listening to his voice. I enjoy his songs, and I've been listening to him since he was 10 years old. I'm a fan of all rock music but my favorite is rock, with all the different types. But Jo JO's voice is like no other. There is something about his voice that makes me want to listen to him over and over again. I can't wait to hear more from him.
Sentiment: Positive

I'm going to buy a CD of just his music. I want to buy everything he has ever done.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

I'm not sure what to say about this album. I have heard some of it before and it just doesn't blow me away. It's a typical generic pop album that you can listen to over and over again. I know I'll probably get a couple more albums from this band but I won't be disappointed.

I bought this album for my son and it is really good. The songs are very catchy and are a good listen to. The only reason this album wasn't one of my favorites was because I didn't like the song "Don't Need You". I don't know why I didn't like this song because I thought the band sounded really good.

I received this album for free in exchange for my unbiased review. I bought this album because I wanted to try a new band and I was not disappointed. I really like all of the songs on this album.

This was an interesting album, I liked the first song the most but it was all average. The songs kept changing after I listened to the first song and the rest of the album. The songs were good but the music was not.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

I feel like I should be giving this song 5 stars, but to be honest I can't be sure. The song is very catchy, and very different, yet in some ways very similar to "We Love You." I remember hearing this song on the radio one time and it was the first thing I thought of when I heard it. I haven't heard it on any other version or arrangement though, so I can't really give it any higher rating.

Amazon review: You can tell that this song did not have a lot of preparation when they recorded this album. They had to get this song together in less than a month, so that is why the song is a little on the short side.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.

I think it's the best album of the year so far.  That's saying a lot, considering that I've been listening to a lot of stuff lately.  

Good album.  I like most of it, but I don't know about the second half.  I really don't know.  It just doesn't seem to fit.  Maybe it's because Rick and his bandmates are not as good as they once were.  The vocals on this album are always good, but they aren't as good as they used to be.  I know it's not that, but I just can't listen to it.  I'm not upset about the album.  That's not my style.  I don't like really "heart-felt" music.  I know there are a lot of people who do like this type of music, but I'm not one of them.  No, I don't like "heart-felt" music.  I like music that makes me feel something.  I think music that makes me feel something is better than music that makes people feel something.  

What's not to like?  I've been listening to this album for about a week now.  I just can't really stand it all.  I guess that's not very surprising.  I don't know.  It just doesn't sound like a "great" album to me.  It sounds like a bunch of crap.  That is not a good thing.  There's nothing wrong with the album, but it just doesn't sound like the great album that I was expecting.  I'm not really sure what I expected, but I was expecting a bunch of great songs.  I guess I was expecting that after the "great" songs, I would get a bunch of "great" songs.  Well, I guess that's not the case.  I'm glad I listened to it, but I didn't like it.  It just didn't sound like the "great" album that I expected.  I think that's pretty fair.  I didn't think it was "great," but it didn't sound like the "great" album that I expected.  

The songs that I didn't like were the songs that I didn't like.  I just can't stand some of them.  It just doesn't seem to fit.  It's not like the songs don't fit; they don't seem to fit.  I'm not complaining, but I just can't stand a lot of the songs on the album.  I just can't stand them.

Amazon review: I wish I'd known about this album a long time ago.  I really really really liked it.  It's one of the few albums I've ever given a real chance, and I'm glad I did.  I would have given it a chance again and again.  I would have given it another chance, and another, and another.  It's one of the few albums I've ever given a chance, and I'm glad I did.  I would have given the second album a chance.  I would have given the third album a chance, and the fourth, and the fifth, and the sixth, and the seventh, and the eighth, and the ninth, and the tenth, and the eleventh, and the twelfth, and the thirteenth, and the fourteenth, and the fifteenth, and the sixteenth, and the seventeenth, and the eighteenth, an nineteenth, and the twentieth, and the twenty-first, and the twenty-second, and the twenty-third, and the twenty-fourth, and the twenty-fifth, and the twenty-sixth, and the twenty-seventh, and the twenty-eighth, and the twenty-ninth.

Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: I love him, not as much as he does, but I have enjoyed all his music to this point. You can find songs like this on any album in the genre, nothing was added to the music world from this album.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: This is a strange album. The songs are repetitive, and the production is mediocre. The songs are not bad, but the songs are not great either. I like the vocals, but the production is just as bad as the songs themselves. I will not repurchase the album, I will not recommend it, and I will not recommend anyone to buy it.

I love the fact that this artist has so many influences. The songs are short, but have a lot of energy. The beats are fast, and there are a lot of different styles of music in this album. This is a great album that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys hip-hop.

Amazon review: This album is about a group of friends who want to go back to their hometown. It is about them being the best friends in the whole world, and also about what happens when they get old and have to move away. There is a great story that involves a lot of different characters who all have their own things that they want to do. This album reminds me of the way a lot of life can go a little bit off the track sometimes. It is a good album and I would recommend it to anyone who likes hip-hop.

Amazon review: I am a fan of this artist, but I always want to pick up a CD, not an album. I have not been able to do this on this album.

I've been listening to the Cali album since it came out. I like it a lot. It's a great album. It's better than the previous two albums.

This time I tried to listen to this album after reading an article about the lyrics of this album being about the same topic as the previous two albums. I found myself enjoying one of the songs on this album that had not been in the previous albums.

I tried to listen to the Cali Lifestyles 1 and 2 on my iPod but I couldn't get past the first three songs on the first album. I think I might just have to start again.

This is the second time I have listened to this album. I was also able to get to all of the songs on this album except for the first 3 songs and then I had to stop. If this album is on sale, I will buy it.

I was thinking about getting this album, but I think I
