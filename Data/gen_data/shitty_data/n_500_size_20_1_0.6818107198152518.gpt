Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

She has been singing these for a really long time and I am a little annoyed that she is doing it so often. I don't like the way she sings these songs that are so repetitive and boring. I also can't stand how repetitive and boring the "I am" lines are. I don't get the "I am" lines at all. She's so boring and always doing the same thing.

Amazon description:

Josh Dimech is a Christian musician who started his music career in the 1990s. He has become known for his acoustic guitar, electric guitar, and piano playing. Josh has performed in every state of the union at the annual Americana Music Festival, has played at hundreds of concerts and events in the U.S. and around the world, and has collaborated with artists such as Joni Mitchell, Dave Matthews, and the Grammy Award-winning Christian rock band, Casting Crowns. These collaborations have included songs such as "Where You Are," "All the Way," "When I'm Alone," and "Heaven Is Waiting." His songs have been recorded by artists such as Amy Grant, Casting Crowns, Jason Mraz, and Joni Mitchell. In addition, he has performed in major concert venues and venues around the world, and has recorded seven CDs. Josh has also produced original music for a number of films and television programs. He currently lives in Nashville.

I had no idea that this guy was a Christian and it makes me very happy to hear him say that he isn't. I really think that he should put his faith in God and not himself. I'm really glad he has faith in God and not himself. That's the main reason why this guy is in the music industry. I don't think that this guy can be a Christian artist because he puts his faith in himself. I don't think he should be in the music industry because he puts his faith in himself. I think that God has something better for him. If God doesn't want him to be in the music industry, then he should try to find God and let that be his goal. If God's not going to give him a great gift, then he should just stop trying to make things better for himself. I hope that God gives him so much better than he has to give. I don't really have too much to say in this review because it is very long. I just want to say that I really like this album and I hope that he continues to write great songs. I like the fact that he says that he is a Christian because I really

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's Songs was just ok.  I've been listening to the songs for at least a year now.  I've got a good album of Leonard Cohen's songs, but this one was just okay.  I think he should have given this to someone who wants to listen to him.

Amazon review: This is a great album, but it's not really Leonard Cohen's album.  I would describe it as a compilation of songs that have become a part of Leonard Cohen's repertoire.  He has recorded it as a way to have his original songs that he recorded as a young man.  There are some truly great songs on here, but it's not really Leonard Cohen.  I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys his early songs, but not to someone like me who only wants to listen to his latest songs.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I was disappointed to hear he was singing for the worship band and not the worship leader.  I am a musician, not a singer and so I enjoy hearing the difference in the instruments and voices.  I am a huge worship leader and this song was a really good way to start our worship time for the week.  I am sure it will get better.  I do agree that the song is quite old.  Maybe more people should take a listen to this version.  I always liked the girl backup singers.  I have a great memory for these kinds of songs so it was hard for me to remember which version I was listening to.  So please, don't forget the studio version.  I am just thankful that I saw it on CD and didn't have to download it.  I don't think I will be getting it again.

There is something in this world that can make you feel like you are God!  With this song the people who hear it have to decide if they are going to be like God, or continue to be like us.  This song has a lot of things that you can hear in this song that make you feel like he is God.  I would recommend this to you if you ever wondered what God is like.  I think there is something for you in this.  Don't listen to this song if you are offended by the Bible.  This is just a song about God telling you what it is like when you think you are God.  Don't listen to this if you think God is not real.  Don't listen to this if you don't want to be God.  Don't listen to this if you are trying to be God.  The name of this song is "I Am".  He can change the name of this song to something else, but I don't know what it would be.  It is just a song about God.  God has chosen to give us a song to tell us what it feels like when you think you are God.  This is a song about how you feel when you know you are God.  God loves it when you know you are God.  God doesn't like it when you know you are God.  This is a song about the people that are like God.  God loves it when people who know they are God are in a place where they can only listen to God.

I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

I have heard a lot about this, but i havent listened to it yet.  I wish I would have listened to it before reviewing it.

I have listened to a lot of hip hop albums this year.  I have heard a lot of rumors about 50 Cent and they are true.  He has a very good voice and he is in a great band.  I will recommend this album to anyone and everyone.  I am glad I found it.  There are some good songs on there.

I bought this album on a sale for 50 cents.  I will recommend this to anyone who likes hip-hop.

This is a good album.  The songs have great lyrics and the music is well done.  It is a good album.  I hope he writes more music in the future.  This is a good album.  I like this album.  I like this album.  I like this album. I like this album. I like this album!

Amazon review: I was happy to see that this track was offered for sale, as it did not come on my original Man of La Mancha CD.  I feel that, with the exception of the "El Hombre De La Mancha" Madrid recording, this is the best recording of the show out there.

On the whole, Man of La Mancha: The Complete Cast Recording is a pretty good CD.  I like both versions.  The show was not available on CD until recently, so many of the original cast members were unavailable for licensing or recording.  This is a shame, as it would be great to hear the whole cast in one recording.  I guess my only problem with the CD is that I wish it had the entire cast.  This CD is only a partial recording and I would like to hear the whole cast on it.

On the whole, Man of La Mancha: The Complete Collection is a pretty good CD.  I like both versions.  The song "El Hombre de La Mancha"
