Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I am a fan of this band and they really do have an amazing sound.  I think this is a good start to the band but I would be interested to hear them play at a live concert as well as record in a live setting.  I am not a fan of this album.  I prefer the band's earlier releases.  This is not a bad album but I don't like it.  I just don't like it enough to own it.

Amazon review: I was a fan of the original band.  But this album was a little too much for me.  I liked the first album, but this was not one of my favorites.  Of course the organ and the guitars are still great but the vocals are too much for me.  I don't mind the music, but I just can't get the vocals to be anywhere near as strong as on the first album.  The organ is really good, but the voice sounds nothing like her singing voice on the first album.  I am not sure if it is an editing problem or if the band has grown as musicians, but it just doesn't work for me.  I would recommend this album to the band's fans and I am sure they will sell a lot of records.  But I don't feel like I have to own it.  But I would recommend that they re-record it with a more powerful voice.  I don't know if the band has changed as musicians, but I would like to hear the band at live performances as well as record in live settings.  I don't think that this album is a bad one, but I just don't like it.

Amazon review: This is a really great album.  It is a great addition to the band's discography.  The organ is really good and the guitars are great.  The vocal harmonies are great.

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I would have to admit that I am not a huge fan of rap in general, but the beats in this song really made me want to buy it.  I would have to say that I think that this song is very well produced.  It has a very good feel to it.  The song is very catchy, but I would have to say that it could use some more beats in it.  I think that there are some good beats in the song, but I would have to say that I don't think that it sounds very 'rap'.  You have a good voice, and a good set of pipes.  I think that it would be quite a fun song to play.  I would rate it a 8 out of 10.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: This was the best Prince album I have heard in many years.  It was not so much an album as an extended set of songs that were intended to be played one after the other on a continuous loop.   It was a very special and unique album for Prince.  It is a work of art. If you like old-school, straight-ahead, acoustic music, this is the album for you.    I can't imagine anyone in the modern era who has not heard this album.

Amazon review: Prince had the ability to write music that could be emotional, as well as, political and spiritual.  On this album, he combines all of his passions on a single album.  This was the first album that Prince wrote with the band, the New Power Generation (NPG).  NPG was a group of musicians that Prince recruited for his new band.  They were not just drummers or a singers.  They were also a guitarist, a keyboardist and an electric bassist.  With these musicians on board the project had direction, purpose and meaning.

This album reflects Prince's growing maturity and a desire for diversity in his music.

Amazon review: This is the first Prince album I have bought and listened to.   This is the first album I have listened to since I lost interest in Prince.    The album is a unique blend of jazz and rock.   I have heard some of his earlier albums and was amazed at the diversity of the music.   This is the first album I have listened to in a long time that had no words on it.   In that sense it is very different.   It has a very modern sound.    On this album Prince has a great voice.   His voice has always been one of my favorites on his albums.     I would love to hear more of his music.   I am looking forward to his next album.

The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I absolutely love this cd.  The vocals are amazing.  The song writing is amazing.  The instruments are just perfect.  I love the keyboards, and the guitars.  The only negative comment I have is that some of the arrangements are a little too tight.  There are a few songs I am not a big fan of, but I have not listened to them all yet.  I love all the songs, and I love the music.

Wow, I've heard a lot of different live albums, but I have to admit this one had me on the floor at first listen. It sounds amazing. I would listen to it again and again. I'll have to add this to my CD player.

Wow! I can't believe it took me this long to post my review on this CD. I just found out about this live CD a few days ago and I've listened to it more than ten times already. This is the best live CD I have ever heard, hands down. I think it's because of the outstanding recording, but I'm convinced it's the band/instrumentation. I can't tell you how great this album is, especially the last song. It's so good that you won't even want to finish the album!

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I did receive this as a gift from the artist.  I have had it for a few months and have listened to it many times.  The song "Hollywood Night" is the best song on the album.

Amazon review: When I bought this album, I was expecting something along the lines of the pop-Rihanna sound - but I was wrong.  This is a solid pop album.  It's not a "pop" album, I wouldn't say that, but it is a pop album.  I would give it a 6.5/10.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: I was looking for a song that would say "I love you" in Japanese, so I purchased this CD and I was pleasantly surprised. It starts out with a gentle piano melody, which transitions into a heavy, powerful guitar riff. The guitar riff is a perfect compliment to the piano, which is then followed by a soft, almost whispered vocals. This is a great addition to any CD collection.
