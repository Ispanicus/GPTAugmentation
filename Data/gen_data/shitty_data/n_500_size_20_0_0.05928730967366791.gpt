Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: This song is a little cheesy.  I love the lyrics, but I think the music is really lame.  I really like the song's chorus and I like the melody.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: Just to be honest, I have not listened to this album more than once.  I have heard it a few times on the radio only.  And, I can only assume that any people who were listening on this album, it is not very good.  But, it is just my opinion.  I have not listened to many albums in my lifetime, and this is one.  This album is full of the same type of dance tracks that I have heard hundreds of other people have produced over the years.  I have tried to listen to it again, but I only have the cd in my car, and it's too far to listen to.

Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I'm not a huge fan of rock and roll.  But I have to give this band a 5 stars because when I first heard it I was so into it, I couldn't wait to buy it, but now I don't know.  I'm not sure what I've done to my ears, but it sounds a little too metal for me, I'm not a fan of that kind of music.  I do like the band, and I like the songs, but I don't enjoy them so much now.  I guess I've lost my taste for it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  The first time Billy Currington and I met he asked me for my autograph and I said yes.  I had no idea what a fan I was becoming.  I was so excited that I wanted to talk to him after the concert.  I had never been to a concert and as soon as the band started singing they made me feel like I was at a rave.  I remember feeling like I was in a trance and just couldn't wait to get to the front of the line.  It was like a drug to me.  I was hooked.

I felt like I was in his house, sitting on the couch, listening to his music.  It was magical.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Lyrics: Numb

When I was a kid I would always sing this song to my friends just to hear how they would react to me.  They would say, "You're Numb."  I would reply, "Oh, I'm not Numb."  I was always right.  In fact, the day that I found out that I was Numb, I went out of my way to not be Numb.  I mean, I was just going through life with the same old emotions and I was just a little bored.

I have been in a bad mood all evening.  I just walked out of the bar.  I didn't drink, I just walked out of the bar.  I'm really tired.  I have been sitting in the back of the bar all evening to kill time, just to kill time.  I just wanted to get out of there, but I just couldn't do it.  I feel like I need to get out of here, but I just can't do it.  I'm so bored.

I had to go to work the next day and I just had to get everything done.  I hated that job, but I just had to get everything done.  I was so tired, so tired of it.  I just had to get it done.  I had to work and I had to get it done.  I

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

I've been listening to this song since I was about 8 years old, back when I first discovered Prince. I heard this song on the radio, and I remember thinking it was so cool, but I never knew the name until about 5 years ago when I picked up another Prince album. I remember the name, and the song, but the moment I realized what album it was from, I forgot it.

I have listened to this song on the radio, in my car, and on my ipod a bunch of times. It's just a great song, and I have to say, I love the way it mixes old school and new school, as it does in the video.

I love this song, and I love the video. I love how the video shows the different sides of the same

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review:  I'm glad that I've been able to see this movie three times.  The first time was at an actual theater.  The second time was at a movie theater.  The third time was on a VOD.  The movie is a good movie, but it doesn't have much to offer in the way of musical numbers.  They did a great job making the movie sound great.  I like the way they used the music in the movie.  It was a little too quiet.  I've heard that they are working on a version with more music.  I've heard that they are working on a version with more singing.  I also heard that they are going to work on making the movie a little longer.  They need to work on telling a story.  I can't tell you about the story, but I know it's a good one.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I like the Christmas music on this CD.  The songs are very good.  There are a lot of different songs on this album.  I was not expecting to hear so many different ones.  The Christmas songs are good, but not at all Christmas like.  I was disappointed that "We're Gonna Rock" was not on this CD.  I would have liked to hear it in the car before/during the concert.

Amazon review: Bought this before going to see the show. Well done. The show was AWESOME! Looking forward to reliving the show with this CD. Came with a digital copy via Amazon Musich which I use mostly to listen to music anyway so that was a nice suprise. The CD is new and works great too.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.
