Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I just wish I would have read the book before I bought it. I've never had an issue with the books I've read. No matter what I've read, I've never had a problem with it. The books I have read have always been well written. It's as if the words will be there before the author has written them. I think I'm just spoiled. I think reading books should be a leisure activity.  I'm not sure what it is about reading books that makes people think they're going to be in a relationship, and then they feel like they're not in a relationship.

Amazon review: It was the one book I didn't read in high school.  I did however reread it a few months ago and was reminded of it.  Very similar to the book, but less like a diary diary and more like a journal.  The book was about a girl who was living in a very small town.  It was set during the Great Depression.  But that's not it, it was about the girl's mother, who was a strong woman and would do anything for her daughter.  Even if it meant sacrificing the life they were living.  I did not like this book at all.  I felt like it was a bit more about the mom than the girl.

Amazon review: I got this book for Christmas. It was supposed to be a book about a young girl's love for Santa Claus.  I have to say that the book was not a very good book.  I think my favorite part was the part when she had a crush on Santa Claus.  I thought she was totally oblivious to Santa Claus.  It was funny because she had never seen Santa Claus.  Now I want to see her again.  I liked this book.  It was about a girl who was born and lived in New York. She grew up with her mother, who was a prostitute.  The mother was her maid.  She had to keep the mother's house clean, make sure the lights were on and that the water was always flowing and that everything was safe.  The daughter wanted to go to college, but the mother was against it.  She wanted her daughter to go to work and earn her own money.  The daughter wanted her to study something.  I think the daughter wanted to go to college and get an education.  I think it would have been interesting to read this book as a pre-teen.  It wasn't a very good book.  I think it would have been better if it was a pre-teen book.

Amazon review: I think this book was good for a pre-teen.  It was about a girl who was born and lived in New England.  Her mother was a prostitute and the only thing a mother could do for her daughter was help her.  The girl wanted to go to college, but the mother was against it.  This book was about a woman who was born and lived in New England.  She worked as a prostitute and had a child.  The child was a boy.  The mother was a prostitute.  She just didn't have the time to raise the child.  The child wanted to go to college, but the mother was against it.  The mother was a prostitute and I think it would have been interesting to read this book as a preteen.  It was not a very good book.  I think it would have been better if the mother was a prostitute.  The mother would have been more believable.  I think a mother who was a prostitute would have been more believable.  I think a mother who was a whore is more believable.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing.

Amazon review: This is my all time favorite album.  I love this album so much that I have it on repeat.  I agree with Cher on this album, the best one she's made to date.

I love the song "If I Could Turn Back Time", I love the song "It's My Life", I love the song "Come See About Me", I love the song "You're Still The One".  I love the song "You're Still The One" because it's the most emotional Cher song I've ever heard.  I love the song "When The Money's Gone" because it's the most upbeat song I've ever heard.  The best part is that this album has the perfect length.  It's short, but it's the perfect length.  I love the songs on this album. I love the songs "You're Still The One", "If I Could Turn Back Time", "My Funny Valentine" and "I Think I Love You".  It's not like a typical Cher album.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The CD is pretty good quality for what it is.  I've seen better quality but nowhere close to this.  The sound is crisp, clear; the songs are well written and arranged. But the vocalists are all-too-rare and the songs are too long for an original cast album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this because I was looking for a soundtrack CD to go with my current CD of a musical I've never seen before.  The cast albums are usually more than $100, and this was $50.  I was surprised that I'd like it as I'd expected it to be a total disappointment.  The only good thing about this CD is that the cast album of that musical is available on vinyl so I can re-visit it and see if it is any better or worse than this CD.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This CD is a complete rip of the original cast album, so you get the whole cast of the musical.  The singers are all-too-rare.  I didn't notice that when I first bought it.  I've only downloaded a handful of cast albums in the past and this one was easy to get and I was surprised to find that it was a complete rip of the cast album.  I usually buy the CDs based on the singers.  The vocals are OK but the songs are short and I expected more than that.  I was hoping for a complete cast album with full lyrics.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I got this cd recently.  I've bought most of the cast albums for the past few years but this time I got the whole cast.  Not only did I get to see the whole cast on stage, I also got to see them sing a song that they never performed, plus the song "Who Can I Turn To" was performed on a radio show with a new cast.  This was the only cast album I've gotten for less than $100.  I was amazed to see that they were all-too-rare.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This concert was recorded live in the early 70's.  I was not expecting it to be live but when I checked the disc it is a complete copy of the cast album.  I was surprised to see it for $11.99 or less.  The music is enjoyable but the lyrics are all-too-rare.  There's a lot of singing and singing and singing even when there isn't any music.  The songs were well written and the cast was all-too-rare.

Amazon review: I have seen them perform this song on the TV show "A Prairie Home Companion" when it was first broadcast.  I'm looking forward to seeing them perform it again live.

I'm not sure since I'm not sure if the vinyl has the right amount of extras to make it worth the money.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.

This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative

Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The sound of the vocals on this album are very unique.  When I heard the song "I Will" I was like "whoa, you're singing the most different style of singing out of all the songs" and it's true.  To me, the vocals on this album are a little different than the original.  The voice sounds a bit more aggressive and edgy.  The vocals also sound a bit more "real" than the original.  Lenny is not the only person on the album to sing different than the original, but I think it's a more natural voice.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Another great song off of this album.  The lyrics are very relatable and the story is a little different than most of the songs on the album.  "I Will" is definitely my favorite off of this album.  The vocals are also very different and the music sounds very different.  It's a great album and I would recommend the album to anyone that has the chance to hear it.

Amazon review: I really like this song.  It's not the best song on the album but it's not a bad song.  I like the music and the lyrics.  The album is filled with good songs but the songs don't really stand out to me.  This is a good album.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: The band's best-known hit, with the best-known lyric, is one of the most important songs in the history of rock 'n roll.  It also happened to be one of the most popular songs of the century, with three versions of it going from hit to classic: the original, the version with the hit version of 'Smoke On The Water', and the version with the song of the same name.  It was also one of the first rock songs to be written by a woman.  And for the first time ever, it was written to be sung by a woman, Patti Smith.

Amazon review: The song "The Day Before Yesterday" was written by David Bowie and is one of the most poignant and moving songs in his entire oeuvre.  The lyrics are poetic; the music is rich and beautiful.  The song was originally performed by Bowie on a TV special called "The Last Night of the Proms" which was a tribute to the original Promenade Concert, which was held on the Promenade in Venice, Italy in 1973.  It was played by David's friend, who also happened to be a violinist, David henderson.  This was the first time the song had ever been performed by a woman.  And it was the first time Bowie had ever performed it.  And it was the first time a woman had ever performed it.  It was performed a last time in November 2000 in a concert celebrating Bowie's 30th anniversary.

I've been a big fan of Boc since their early days in the 1970s.  I've seen them live several times over the years, and I've seen them in concert a few times over the years.   They were one of the first bands to write original songs that were not covers, and they were one of the first bands to do so.  They were also one of the first bands to do so in the United States in the mid-1970s.  I've been a fan of Boc since the 1970s.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.

I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: This has a very good feel to it, and the guitars are very tight and powerful.  It is a very powerful rock sound, and I love it.  It does not have any ballads, and I think that it would work better with a ballad or some soft, romantic music.  I really enjoy it and wish it was longer and had a better song.  I would go through this song about 10 times before I got to the end, and then I would have a break for about 10 minutes until I could listen to it again to get the rest of the lyrics.  I think the sound is good, and the music is very good, but the lyrics are very boring and I would really like to hear a song about love.

Amazon review: I love the Killers, but I think this album is a little too much for me.  Overall this album is excellent, but there are several songs that I find to be a little over the top.  I think the songs "Death of a Bachelor" and "Killing Me" are two of my favorites on the album.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Love the Killers but this album is a little too much for me.  I have to say that the Killers are one of my favorite bands.  I have loved the Killers from the first time I heard them.  I have bought this album 6 times already and I am looking forward to buying more from them.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the Killers.  It is a good album.  I am not thrilled with the Killers new album, "Killing Me" but I can understand why people are so negative about it.  I think the band has a lot of talent, but they lack the ability to express themselves in a song.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Bruno Mars has a very distinct sound. But I think this album is great! He's now one of the top 10 artists that are on everyone's TBR list. His sound is now very different. His music is more R&B. There is nothing wrong with this one. The only thing that I'm not a fan of is Bruno Mars. I don't like his style. But I LOVE his music. I love his voice. I love the lyrics and the message of his songs. I'm going to listen to this album until I die. I even gave it 4 fives and a ten.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I recently purchased this album and I couldn't wait to listen to it. I have heard Bruno Mars say that he's going to be releasing an album this year, so I did not think it would be a good idea to wait, but now that it is out, I will definitely be listening to it. - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The first thing that I have to say is that this album is very, very different from the other Bruno Mars albums I have heard. But it sounds like Bruno Mars, which is exactly what I like. The only thing that I don't like is the fact that the album is two hours long. - - - - - - - - - - - - - ~~~

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I love this song. It's the hardest song that I think I've ever listened to, and I'm glad I did it. The song is just so perfect. It's like a dream that you can't wake up from. It's like a really happy song that's sad that has no end. Its a simple song that's really intense. I'm not one for r&b music, but I give this song a solid 3/5.
