Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: Since Perry Como, bing Crosby and All the rest have now passed on. I felt what better for Christmas than an OSMOND! What was I thinking? Marie has abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretations for a More R and B AKA GHETTO vocal style. Gone is the Marie of class and style and in with the MARIE of the 20th century with BAD vocal arrangements. What are you thinking Marie? I don't want to hear ANOTHER singer imitating ANOTHER singer who sounds like ANOTHER Whitney or Mariah.

Amazon review: This was the third record I received. The first two were in mint condition and the third was all scratched up. I thought there was something wrong with the sleeve, but at first I thought it was just a scratch. I was right, it was the sleeve!

Amazon review: I have been a big fan of this band for as long as I can remember.  They are a great band that has come up with some great ideas.  I have only a few songs on this CD.  I would say that if you liked the songs on 'Dance in the Streets', then you will dig this CD.  The songs are different from the band's other albums, and I like that.  You will have to get the LP to hear the entire album.  I don't think that I will ever buy this album again, but it is a great album.  It has a lot of great songs that will remind you of some of your favorite times at the beach with friends.  I would recommend this album to anyone who appreciates a good band.

It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: This song was the first song I learned to play on the piano.  The first time I heard it I could not play it fast enough, the second time I was in second grade, I was in 4th grade.

I am not sure if it is because I am older, or because the song is popular, but I am a piano player and have a gift for it.  I will never buy CDs, they are all the same, just a bunch of filler.  This song is real good and I would never waste money on any other song.  I have seen how the sales staff treats the customers who buy the CD's.  They play the CD over the radios and give the CD away to others who like it.  I have seen people that I know buy the CDs thinking they would get a good song, and then return it for a bad song.  What a rip off!

Amazon review: This CD is good, I wish I could hear the original.  But this is like a re-cut of an album.  The original was great.  If you want traditional gospel, go to the '90s.  I don't like this one at all.  The song, "I'll Be There" is a great song and is sung with true emotion.  I don't know about the song, "Do You Know", on the other hand.  I find it pretentious.  This one was made in 1998.  And, it is a re-cut of a great album.  The original was great.  The original was great.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.

Amazon review: I have not been this disappointed with an album since I've become a fan of The Cure's fifth album. To say that "Love Buzz" is a let down would be an understatement. I have become accustomed to the "songs" that are on this album, songs that I like to listen to and that have a lot of meaning to me. I thought "Love Buzz" was going to be the same as all the other songs on this album, and I thought it would be a good album. I was wrong. I have been listening to this album for almost a year now, and it has taken its toll on me. I could never get past the thought that this album is "just a song", and I can't tell you exactly why it has taken me this long to give up on this album. I know that I am not the only fan that has given up on this album, but I am at a point where I am very much looking forward to getting my hands on their new album. I know I am not alone in this feeling, and the reason why I don't want to get their new album is because I can't stand this album.

#812 - lareine japanese

The band's songs are in everyones ears. If you are a fan of old school rock and roll, then you can not go wrong.
I like the band's music. I enjoy listening to their music. They're not all that great, but the good ones do make me happy.
I just don't like some of the lyrics and I don't think the band can make it as a serious band. I am not really into the whole "rock" thing.
I like the band, but I don't think they are serious. I think they are really young and not that good.
I like the music and the lyrics. I don't like the band's music, but I do like their music.
I like the band, but I don't like the music.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

This is the third and final part of the series.  The first part dealt with the songs that were already released through ZYX Music.  The second part dealt with the songs that are currently 'in the works'.  Today we are going over the songs that will be released by ZYX Music.

#1: I Wanna Come Home

This is a great song. It's a little hard to describe, but it's a good song. This song is a great song for a song. But as to how great it is...well...for you to decide for yourself. I will say that I had a really good time with it.

A:

Just to add to this:
The vocals are very clear.
While the song is in mp3 format, it's not a bad choice.
It's just too loud to where you can't hear the lyrics.
The song is also in mp3 format, and it's also in a lossy format.
It's not an issue of the file format, but rather the fact that all tracks in an mp3 file are in the same lossy format.
So, that's why it's not a problem with the quality of the file, but rather it's lossy, meaning that in some part of the file you have to have a lossy codec to make it playable.
So, even if you can't hear the lyrics, it's still a good song.
So, you can just keep it.
But if you want to download it, you'll have to convert it to another file format (or just skip it, if you don't want to convert it).

I think it will be helpful to see the lyrics here, as it may make the difference between "not a good song" and "a good song" (in your case).
I think they're as good as what you would get from  Amazon's description.

This is what Amazon says:

This is one of the most annoying songs I have ever heard. It is
  so loud that you can't hear anything, and then you realize that
  it is loud because you can't hear the vocals.

It doesn't matter. You can still listen to it and decide for yourself. If you want to download it, you'll have to convert it to an mp3 file. (At least, I assume you'll have to convert it to an mp3 file, since you said that you want to download it.) 
If you're not using a computer, you can still listen to it on your phone, which has a very small mp3 player, or on your player.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of a song by The Bee Gees, but I am not sure from which album.  This is one of my favorite songs.  It has a great beat and is very catchy.  I actually thought that this song was good in the beginning.  I liked it, but I guess it just did not last long.

Amazon review: I love the song, and I love that the singer is so good at singing.  It sounds like Sam Sparro's "Black and Gold," but not as good.  The song is great to hear live, and it has a great beat to it.  The lyrics are a little confusing but I think it is very catchy and has a great beat, so I would like to hear it performed live.

Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album many times. I like the first part where I get a good mix of styles. I like the second part when they mix the techno and the electronica.

The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

This album is a nice addition to my collection of oldies. Very relaxing and calming. Nice to listen to while waiting for the kids to get ready for school. No loud rock songs for the teenage crowd.

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: I have always thought that this song is one of the best and most original of the 60's.  The lyrics and melody were so fresh and original in the 60's.

So many things about this song is pure gold.

Amazon review: I am not a big fan of the music industry.  I've always been a fan of singers like Stevie Ray Vaughan and Dixie Chicks and like to listen to their music and try to absorb as much as I can.  I have a really hard time believing how some artists get paid millions of dollars and yet they aren't any good. The most important thing is to have a good sound on the guitar, and that's the most important thing.  If you can't play the guitar good, you can't play the guitar at all, and that's a shame.

Amazon review: I agree with the reviewer. For those of you who are not familiar with this artist, he is a highly respected artist known for his hard-hitting R&B and Hip Hop music. This album was released in early 2008 and came under a different name. The first album was entitled "Busta Rhymes" and it featured the artist with a new group called "The D-Shapes". This album takes a different route, focusing on a heavier music and not being so much about the lyrics and the flow. The album is definitely not meant to be heard on a CD player while driving or while watching a movie. It is meant to be heard at a r & b club or in a club where the r & b is happening. This album is a great example of what Hip-Hop can be, and it is a great example of how to mix different styles, just like anything else in this world.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you are a fan of The D-Shapes or Busta Rhymes, you will enjoy this album. The D-Shapes are the quintessential group you would want to see in any Hip Hop concert, and they are the ones that you will recognize and be able to hear on the album. The D-Shapes are all extremely talented, with the exception of one person. This person is not a talented artist at all, and the fact he is on the album shows how bad he really is. The album features both D-Shapes and busta rhymes, and even though I would have liked to see them each on their own, I can't help but be jealous of the talented artists that are featured on the album. Busta rhymes in this album is the best thing I have heard in a long time. It is definitely not a typical hip hop album, but you will certainly hear it on the radio and you will probably be able to recognize it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The album "Busta Rhymes" is an excellent album that could be the next big thing in Hip Hop. I mean, if you are a fan of The D-Shapes, you will most likely enjoy the album. The D-Shapes are excellent and their songs are very entertaining.

Amazon review: I finally got this album and I wish I had got it sooner. This is the perfect album for me, because it has praise, worship, prayer, and contemporary gospel music. It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: JP is a great guitarist no question, but I'm afraid it's impossible to differentiate between his writing(and playing) on this album and any of the Mike Varney sponsored'shred' albums of the eighties.  The backing tracks are formulaic, the ballads appear as expected, the exotic scales are in place, even some 'bluesy' playing - it's as if JP is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he didn't listen to some Jeff Beck!
