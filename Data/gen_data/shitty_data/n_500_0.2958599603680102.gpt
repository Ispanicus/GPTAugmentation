Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

He is doing a cover of a song that has a little more soul, but still sounds like crap. I am not a huge fan of covers, and this just seems like a cover.  I don't like how it sounds over the acoustic guitar on the chorus.  I am pretty sure that I would have loved it on the original album.  As for this cd I am going to pass on this one.

Amazon review: The album sounds like it's from the same company.  I don't like the sound quality and would suggest listening to the demo. I don't like the style.  Although, the songs sound good.  I just don't feel like I am buying a CD.  I was looking for a CD, and this is just a CD.  I don't feel that the CD really does anything special for me.  I don't feel that it is worth $15.

Amazon review: It's a cover of a Pink song.  It's not bad, but that just doesn't make it worth the cost of the CD.  If you like Pink, or any of her other songs, you will enjoy this.  It's good music that doesn't try too hard.  I am not a Pink fan.  But, this is good.  It's not great, but it is good.

Amazon review: I can think of many bands that I would never have heard of, if it weren't for their cover albums.  This is one of those.  I am disappointed in this release.  I was really looking forward to this cd.  The sound quality is questionable as well.  The cover, I'm not a fan of that either.

I'm glad I went to the trouble of downloading the cd to see what the songs were like.  I was not disappointed as I expected.  The songs are very good.  I have found many good Pink songs on Youtube and it all sounds good on this cd.  I believe the song "You're So Negative" is the best of the songs on this cd.  I would recommend this cd to any person who is a fan of Pink.

Amazon review: I love this album.  I like that it contains several different types of music.  All of the CDs I have so far have been from artists who are "oldies" and have a very "classic" type of sound.  I think this album has a much more contemporary feel to it.  It is not like a "modern" Christmas album, it is more like a "modern" instrumental Christmas album.  I enjoy listening to it, and I think it is also a great way to learn the songs.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this disc on the way to work and have found that it is an excellent introduction to Christmas music.  The only complaint I have is that the disc is not labeled as "Christmas" so that the listener cannot compare the disc to a typical holiday CD.  I would like to see this disc labeled as "Christmas" because it is not like a typical Christmas CD and, I think, would help with the purchase decision, and also because I think it is a wonderful introduction to the joys of Christmas.

Amazon review: I have been a longtime fan of the Steely Dan catalogue, first in the early days of the band, and latterly, in the present day.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: One of the most underrated artists of all time, Joe Cocker's career was almost completely overlooked until his death. When he was just starting out at the age of 18, he got caught up in his own hype, and then was pushed aside for more popular musicians. He had a very raw, yet beautiful voice. It was very hard to find this voice in music.

Amazon review: The album was recorded in 1967 but was not released until 1969, after the song "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'".

I have been very intrigued by their music since I first heard their first album and they have been one of the most influential bands in the world.  I was hoping that this was going to be a compilation of their unreleased material.  I was let down by it, because it does not feel like a compilation of their first album, as it is very much a collection of their other albums, and I didn't find any unreleased material.  I was expecting a mix of the first album and their other albums.  I was also not really happy with the sound quality or production on the album.

Amazon review: "You want to make sure that you can get an order to fill and you want to make sure that you are getting the best price.  If the book was good, it would be on Amazon.com, but it isn't.  The book is filled with spelling mistakes.  It is not even close to being a good copy, it is a copy that is filled with spelling mistakes."  I am sorry to say that this is a typical Amazon review.  I won't be buying this book.  I don't even know if it is a real book or not.  I can only assume that this is the opinion of an Amazon customer who has not read the book.  If they have not read it, then why did they write a review about it?  This has to be a mistake.  I would have to say that if I had purchased this book, I would have returned it.  I would not have read it.  I would have thrown it out.  
I do enjoy reading Amazon reviews.  I've read hundreds of them.  It is a good way to get a sense of what customers are thinking about the products that they are buying.  What do they like or dislike about the products they are buying?  I like to read Amazon reviews because they give me a little insight into what customers are thinking about the products that they are buying.  I can learn from their comments.  If they are positive, then I must be selling the product well.  If they are negative, then I must be selling the product poorly.  However, I don't think that I need to read Amazon reviews.  I would just like a book that isn't filled with spelling mistakes.  
On a different note, I want to buy a book.  It is Christmas.  I cannot find any books on Amazon, but I do have a lot of books from Barnes and Noble.  Amazon does not like to promote their books, so it is possible that I will be able to find a book there instead.  
Thanks.

Amazon review: I really like the premise behind this book.  However, the writing is very dull.  It is hard to make out what is going on.  It is not a difficult book to read.  It can be read in a day, but it is not something that I would read over a period of time.

Amazon review: I'm not a big fan of Adam Sandler, but he is definitely on the right track. The first two tracks on this album were very good. The rest of the album was pretty good. The lyrics were good on this album. I guess I shouldn't complain about Adam Sandler's music as I could probably use a few of his songs.

Amazon review : This is a great album, a really great album. I love Adam Sandler, and his music, I have also seen a lot of Adam Sandler movies, and I think I have seen everything he has done. But I have never seen this Adam Sandler movie, but I have heard it many times from friends. I thought that Adam Sandler was really funny back when he was on SNL, I thought he was a great comedian, but he turned out to be a great singer..so I give this band a big thumbs up!

Amazon review: I bought this album, and I must say it is GREAT! I have listened to all of Adam Sandler's music, and I have to admit I don't know much about him. But when I first heard this album, I was like, "Oh, what a great piece of music!" After a while, I realized what a great piece of music this was! I have also listened to a lot of Adam Sandler's music, and I must say, he is a great singer. The lyrics are great, and I like the flow of the songs. This is a great album, and I am glad to have purchased it!

Amazon review: I've always been a fan of the Jonas Brothers. I think they are a great group of guys. I like them very much. Now I've got a bunch of new music from them. There are like 60 songs on this 7-disc CD. A lot of the songs are great, and I think I will listen to a lot of these songs.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I first heard the Jonas Brothers when I was a kid, I was in first grade, and my parents didn't have cable, and we had a VCR. I can't remember the name of it, but we had a VCR with the Jonas Brothers on it. But I do remember that I was very, very, very impressed when I heard them. I listened to them in the car, and I listened to them in the house. I don't remember how long I listened to it, but it was a very, very long time. I started listening to their music as soon as I could. My mother would listen to the radio when she was cooking, or when she was cleaning. She would listen to the stations that had Adam and the brothers. When I was about 10 or 11, I started listening to their music every day. When I was 16, I had a cassette tape of their music. I wanted to listen to more of it, but they didn't have a CD, so I had to buy a cassette

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

I love the fact that they are all original and different from each other, and the music is good, but I really love the way they are singing and the harmonies. They just sound like a great band that you would want to hang out with. But most of all I love the fact that they are a family. A band that really loves each other, and they really do.

Amazon review: OMG i have two copies of this album. too bad its still not on CD but its my  3rd favorite cher album. stars being my favorite. get your copy BEFORE its too late and it truly is more rare then it already is NOW. My favorite songs are Long distance love affair, (the only single) I'd rather believe in you, and It's A Cryin' Shame! I believe this album is HIGHLY underrated and deserves more credit!
