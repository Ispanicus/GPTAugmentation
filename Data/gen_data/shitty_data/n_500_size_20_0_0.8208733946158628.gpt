Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at. Not the case with this one, it's just devoid of charm or humor. It reminds me of a George Carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas. I wish i could un-listen to it, don't waste your time.

Amazon review: Don't get me wrong, I love her in concert. She is a wonderful singer, but this is not an easy song to interpret. I can't listen to it long enough to tell you how it goes, but if you know the words and can follow along then this is a great song.  It may not be to everyone's taste, but if you like it, then go ahead and sing it.  You will like it I promise.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This is a great CD, however, it was not a good experience for me.  It has been a long time since I last purchased vinyl, and I wanted to get a deal.  I just wanted to see if the band was doing well, and it is.  I have had no problems with the product, it was very well put together.  I've spent the extra money for a better version of the music.  So, I guess the product is good.  I was surprised that the band was in another country when I got it.  I was not interested in the song "I'm A Good Girl"  because the band has never made a great CD before.  I thought that they were going to break up, because of the problems they had.  Anyway, I was surprised that they still were together, and they did not come back to the USA to play for everyone!  Anyway, I guess the band is still together, and they are still singing the songs that they wrote.  I was surprised by the song "The World Is Just A Big Funhouse", and I really liked the song "A Good Girl Is Hard To Find".  But the rest of the songs are really boring and uninteresting.  It is a good CD, but it just needs a lot of work to make it a better CD.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good CD, and I would only recommend the CD if you like the band.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: They sound like a band that is not ready to make its move up the ladder.  They put out 2 really boring cd's, one for the younger crowd (which is actually good, but I will not review it) and the other one for the older crowd (which I am sure is really boring, I don't like it).  I want to get out of the US for a while, but I do not have the money to pay for the 2 cd's that are not worth getting.  I know that I will not be disappointed in the cd's.

Amazon review: I really like this band.  They have always been my favorite band.  I was just able to find out about the new CD's.  They are really good, and I wish they would just start playing with the people that already know them.  They could have made more money this year, instead we are stuck with two really boring cd's.  The only band that I would recommend is NFG because I know that they will still be around, and I would not recommend the band unless you like good pop rock.  I am just tired of seeing them on the same cd's for the last 10 years.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

A song that is not very good.

I have to admit that the song was not the original. 

The only original song on this album is "Heartache" (the only original song on the album), yet it is not even close to the original. It would be better to say, it is not even original.

A good recording, but not a good song.

Every song on the album is original at least partially. I'm not sure what you mean because if by original you mean the song is not the original or not close to the original then there are a few other songs on the album that are not the original and are not close to the original, and there are a few other songs on the album that are not the original but are close to the original, and there are a few other songs on the record that are not the original but are the same as the original, and there are a few other songs on the album that would be considered a close to the original, but they are not original.

The only original song on the album is "Heartaches", yet it is not even close to the original. It would be better if you say it is not even close to the original. It is more original than the original version of Heartaches. I would say it is as close to the original as Heartaches is, but I would not say it is as close as Heartaches is to the original. I would say it is closer to Heartaches than Heartaches is to the original. It is not as close as Heartaches is to the original, but it is closer to Heartaches than Heartaches is.

Amazon review: I really don't like this album.  I think the sound quality is abysmal, and the lyrics are pretty annoying (if you don't know the lyrics, you won't get it.)  I really wish they would have gone back to the old way of singing.  You should be able to easily sing along if you know the words.  Instead, they just repeat the same lyrics 3 times, and then repeat them again.  I don't even know how they made the sound on the first song.  They could have done it with a synthesizer.  They also kept the guitar parts the same throughout the song.  It just doesn't sound good.  The lyrics are annoying in their own right, but the sound quality is just so bad there's no way to "fix" it.  I don't even know what song they are talking about or what it refers to.  The guitar sounds like it might have been recorded in a garage.  The bass guitar sounds like it's being played by a drunk man with a bad case of indigestion.  The drums sound like they're being played by someone who is trying to get a job, but is being fired.

Amazon review: I thought this album was really good.  It's not that it doesn't have a "good" sound, it's just that the production is really low.  It's so bad that I have to turn my speakers up to 11 sometimes to hear it.  The songs are also recorded in a very low bass range.  Even though this is a good album, it's not a good album.  I don't know what the album is about, but it doesn't add up.  The vocals are horrible and the lyrics are usually in the same bad languages that one can see on the internet.  The songs are repetitive and the music is the same as the next song.  It is a really bad album.  There is no way to fix the sound quality.  The low bass sounds are so distorted that I couldn't even get the song to play.  You can't even hear the music.

Amazon Review: 'A Taste of the Past' - Dr. John

Dr. John's album "A Taste of the Past" is an incredible collection of hits and standards - from the Bee Gees to John Fogerty to Elvis Costello. It's a testament to the power of the Dr. John's catalog that so many of these classics are still alive and kicking.

The album cover of "A Taste of the Past" is a picture of a dinner party, with the Dr. John's logo in the center. Dr. John's logo is a combination of a cross with a circle. The image has a hint of a smile on the Dr. John's face, and the cross on the logo is pointing upward.

Dr. John has been a popular solo artist and member of The Eagles for many years, releasing numerous albums including "A Taste of the Past". His first solo album was "Dr. John: From the Inside Out", released in 1971.

The album was released for the first time on March 9, 1974. It is the first of several Dr. John albums released on Warner Bros. Records.

The album includes the Bee Gees' "One After 909", John Fogerty's "Them There Eyes", the Bee Gees' "I Started a Joke", the Bee Gees' "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face", the Bee Gees' "I Am a Rock", the Beatles' "When the World Was Still Young", the Stones' "It's All Over Now", the

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is one of the most important recordings of the decade. It's not just a great collection of songs, it's an attempt to put on a great performance for the whole audience, and it's a great show. Roger Waters, The Prodigy, and The Smiths are on the same level as The Who, Led Zeppelin, and Radiohead, and they all have something that they are good at. This is music of great craftsmanship that will be a landmark in 20th century music. The album doesn't just sound great, it is great.

Amazon review: This is a really good album. I was disappointed when they put it out, but it has grown on me and I think it is really good. I will rate it 5 stars.

Amazon review: I was hoping for an album like "Live In Japan" with that "Haunting" and "Haunting Echoes" sound to this album, but it is not what I expected. This is an ok album, but I don't think it will make me want to listen to the new Pink Floyd album. I don't mind listening to the old Floyd, but the new Floyd is just not as good as the old Floyd. I rate it 2 stars.

Amazon review: My wife and I are both huge Pink Floyd fans, and I have no problem with that - as long as I don't have to hear the Floyd sing the songs I've already heard.

I give it 4 stars.

Amazon review: This is a great album, but not what I expected. I gave it a 5 star rating because it is a great album. The only thing I am unsure of is how the band actually sounds. The music is good, but the band sounds a lot like the 70's era Pink Floyd. I give this a 3.5 star rating.

Amazon review: I've seen a few interviews with Elvis Costello and he's said that he's a huge fan of The Beatles, but the reality of the matter is that he's just a casual listener of the Beatles. He's a fan of all their music, but as for the Beatles themselves, he's been known to say that he "really doesn't know them". He's not a big Beatles fan. He's a fan of The Rolling Stones, The Byrds, and The Who, who he admires greatly, but he isn't a huge fan of them, either. He's an Elvis Costello fan, and a fan of a lot of other artists as well, but it's not like he's into the whole idea of the Beatles, much less the idea of the Beatles as a group. He's a fan of some songs, but he doesn't put much stock in them, and he's not into the idea of the Beatles as a group either. He's a fan of the Beatles, and he's not a fan of the Beatles, period. He's just a fan of Elvis Costello.

Amazon review: The first half is a great, fun, energetic rock and roll tune. It's very cool to listen to the first half of the song. The second half is one of the best songs in the Beatles catalog. It has a nice balance between the two halves. I like the way the Beatles ended the song, by having the whole band sing, with the exception of Ringo and Paul McCartney who are still singing the verse, and George Harrison who is singing the bridge. After the Beatles finished singing, the band joined in together, and played the rest of the song together. I don't know if this is how they normally played it, but it works for me.

Amazon review: John Lennon and the Beatles are a great band. There is no doubt about it. They are good, original, and creative. They are the best rock and roll band of all time. I can't say that about the Rolling Stones, and I can't say that about the Beach Boys either. I'm not a huge fan of the Beach Boys, but I love them. This is the Beatles, and they are the best.

Amazon review: This is the first Beatles album I've ever purchased. I was not aware of the Beatles, even though I always listened to the radio. When I was younger, I always listened to the radio.

This is my first Beatles album, and it is awesome! If you haven't already, buy this album!

A:

You have a couple of problems. The first is that the sample is from the album "A Little Christmas Time", which is not the same as "Happy Christmas" (it isn't even the same song as the album, but the words are the same). The second is that the album has been released in the UK as a double album with "A Little Christmas Time", but you have the US release ("Christmas Time" album) here.

A:

The album doesn’t have the explicit label. You can see the album name is clearly printed.

A:

Yes, you have the explicit label!

  

  

  

The album is indeed called "A Little Christmas Time".

  

However, as the album is released in the US, it is the "Christmas Time" album.

A:

You are right. There is no explicit label! The label says "Christmas Time", so the album is only called "Christmas Time" in the US.

  

However, you can see clearly on the label that it is the explicit album.

  

The album is indeed a double album.

  

  

However, the songs are only on one of the albums, not both.

  

  

So, the album you have is labeled "A Little Christmas Time" and it is actually "Christmas Time" album in the US.

  

  

A:

Yes, you are correct. You can see by looking at the label on the back cover that A Little Christmas Time is the only explicit album.

  

However, the label on the front of the album says " Christmas Time" in the US.

A:

You are correct! The album is indeed called "A Little Christmas Time".

  
 
However, the song "I Love Christmas" is also on the double album "Christmas Time" album.

  

However, the album is called Christmas Time in the US.

  

  

However, the song "I Love Christmas" is on both albums.

  

You can still see that the album is the "Christmas Time" album in the US.

  

 

However, the song "I Love Christmas" is on both the albums, but the album "Christmas Time" is on the back cover.

  

  

  

The album is therefore labeled "Christmas Time" in the US and is actually the "Christmas Time" album.

  

However, the single track "I Love Christmas" is on both the albums; the album "Christmas Time" is on the front cover and "Christmas Time" is on the back cover.

A:

Yes, you are correct.

  

However, the album is indeed called "A Little Christmas Time" and has the explicit label.

  

However, the song "I Love Christmas" on the album is also on the double album "Christmas Time" album.

 

However, you can see the explicit label on the front cover of the album "Christmas Time" in the US.

 

However, the song "I Love Christmas" is also on the album "Christmas Time" in the US.

 

You can still see that the album is the "Christmas Time", and the song is on both the albums.

 

You can still see that the album is the explicit album, and the song is also on both albums.

  

You can still see that A Little Christmas Time is the only explicit album of the album; the album is labeled "Christmas Time".

 

It is not the explicit album. However, it is the only explicit album of the album "Christmas Time" in the US.

  

You can see the explicit label here on the front and back covers of the album "Christmas Time".

  

  

You can see the explicit label here on the back cover of the album "Christmas Time".

  

The album is indeed the "Christmas Time" in the US.

A:

Yes, it is clearly labeled "Christmas Time" in the US.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I had a blast listening to this show.  Just as I am getting to the end of my collection of "The Best of the 50's" from the era, I discovered this show.  The best thing about it was the music, and the fact that the lyrics were so fresh!  The music was so crisp and vibrant that it didn't make me miss the days of old.  As far as the lyrics, they were original, and brought back some great memories.  The band was just as good as you would expect with a great vocal sound.  The only thing that I wish they'd have done is to get someone like the Drifters on the show.  The Drifters were always one of my favorites, and I would have loved to hear them on this show.  And after the Drifters, I would have loved to hear the rest of the classic acts of the era.  But, it was fun to hear them sing and play their hits.

Amazon review: I wish I bought this album when it was first released.  I just happened to mention it on a previous post here on the blog.  I was so happy when I heard that the CD was still available on CDBaby.  This album is really one of the best I have ever heard.  I'm a huge fan of the original version of the Drifters, and this version is amazing!  I love the way the Drifters changed their sound to incorporate their new sound.  It's a real treat to hear them in the original setting.  The band has just as much personality as when they were playing the hits of the 50's.  I love how they incorporated songs like "I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter" which had a very modern sound.  The lyrics are very fresh, and they are fun to listen to.  I can't wait to hear more songs from this album.

This was the first time I had heard them perform in the past 20 years.  The setlist was very interesting, with a lot of different styles of music.  I really liked the new songs they played, and was surprised that they were doing the Billy Boy and the 3 Stooges songs back to back.  The only thing I didn't like was seeing how late it was.  I had to leave work and walk home from work and come back.  It was very uncomfortable and boring for me, but that's just me.  I will most likely get another chance to see them again in the future.

Amazon review: I was very excited to see this on here, but am sad to see that it was about 80$ or something.  The one from 1982 was a little cheaper, about 60$.

Amazon review: The only songs I can say I can't stand are this song and "I Got the Music in Me" by the Osmonds.  Those are the only two that are so bad it makes me throw up.  I don't know how I can love them.

Amazon review: I've heard this song on the radio a few times, but never saw it on the TV in my house, so I can't say how good it actually is.  The best part about it is that it's so short.  I'm only on the first few notes and then it's done.  Not to mention the "Oh, I can't believe it's the same song but better" part.  Yeah.  I'm not going to take the time to listen to it, I'm just going to throw this out there.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a good song.  It's more of a "Oh my God, this song is so awesome, I have to sing it to you over and over again" song.  It's also really short.  I wish I was paying more attention to this song though.  It's just so good and I know I'll love it more from listening to it over and over again.

Amazon review: This is a song that I would love to have in a concert.  It's a really great song and it's fun to listen to.  It's a little "out there" compared to others.  I love the chorus though.  Just a great song to listen to and not have to sing it over and over.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this song.  The only thing that I can't stand is the first couple of bars.  However, as soon as I'm done with those, I can't wait to hear the rest.  The intro and the intro to the second verse are the best parts.  And the chorus is pretty good too.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the song, but only because it's an original song.  I would have preferred the original version.  It's a great song, but as soon as it starts, I feel sick.

Amazon review: I like her voice, but I don't like the song.  I like a lot of the songs, but there are a few that I don't like.  I like "I'm Still Waiting".  I can't stand "I'm Still Waiting" though.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A great song with great vocals, but boring.  I don't want to see a live performance of it.

Amazon review: I like to hear songs I can listen to over and over again.  I don't know why, but I like this song.  It has a lot of great choruses and great melodies.  Unfortunately, I don't know if I would like it live.

Amazon review: I think this song is great.  I like the sound of it.  I just don't see myself singing it.  It's a great song though.  I've never heard of the song, and I'm glad to see that it's on here.

Amazon review: This is the only song I can think of.  It's great.  It's a catchy tune, and it's all kinds of fun.  The only thing I can't stand is the first chorus.  It's just not very

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: This was a fun listen. I listened to it in the car and then later at the office, with my coworkers, and I really enjoyed the sound and the lyrics. The voice of the female narrator was very compelling. I could totally see her saying the words to the song to someone. I've been doing research on the song since my friend suggested I check it out. I'm not a fan of this song, but I'm interested to see how it plays out in a film. If it gets a chance to be made, I would recommend seeing it.

Amazon review: I'm kind of bummed out. I loved the song but I guess some people are just in love with the song. I would rather have heard this song in the same vein as "I Want You," where it's a love song, not a song of lust. Otherwise, it's a very good song.

This album was a disaster. The title track was over-produced to the point of being annoying. The other songs are okay, but nothing to write home about. I listened to the whole thing and it
