Amazon review: Jackie's voice has really matured. As other reviewers have said and I agree with, "this is hauntingly beautiful". This being the first single from her new album, I really can't wait to hear the other songs from the album.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead. Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.

Amazon review: Sanjaya was entertaining on IDOL.  But he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy.  This "song" is terrible!  Off-key warbling, non-melodic, soulless.  Pass this up ASAP!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this artist and his music.  I think it's his ability to create a new style each time that makes him so interesting.  The fact that he's not a singer-songwriter who's looking for hits is a plus.  When he says "I don't want to be like anybody else", he's absolutely right!

Amazon review: This song does the whole "I hate everything" thing. But, it's a good one.  It's got that "Hollywood" feel to it.  I could listen to this song all day.  And, it's a really catchy one too.

###
Amazon review: This song was just too good for me to ignore.  I have to admit that it's catchy, and I like the melody.  But, I just can't shake the feeling that everything he sings is just a crock of shit.  He's not the only one who's gotten this kind of response though, it seems the whole label had this reaction to the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you are looking for a quick song that will get your body moving and your mind in the right place, then "Walking On Sunshine" is the way to do it.  It has a great beat that will hook you right in.  It's not the type of song that will make you feel good though.  You'll feel like you are walking to work on your knees and with a backpack on.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you like classic rock music, and you like rock and roll, then this is the CD for you.  This is the kind of music that will get you in the mood for a night on the town.  This is also a great song to play on the way to work.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really like the way this song is sung.  The drums are very well done, the bass also is very well done, and the guitar work is good, but I really like the lyrics.  It made me think of a time when I was going crazy with my friends, and I thought it would be funny to dress up in a costume and join them in their song and dance.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: So, I like "Ain't Nobody's Business" a lot.  I just don't like the sound of it.  I think the vocals are good, but the music just makes me feel like I'm listening to a bad, cheap stereo.

###
Amazon review: This song reminds me of a song I heard on the radio a long time ago.  It was part of a rock & rolling band that played on the radio station.  The song was a big hit and the band was really famous, but the song was terrible, and I can't stand it.  I won't go into the details, but it really just goes to show that a band doesn't have to be good to be popular.  A good song, but a bad song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Not so much a song as a movie.  Just one of those'song-in-a-movie' type songs that you find on the radio.  But, to me, it's more like a movie.  Not a bad movie, but a movie that only makes me feel sorry for the person who wrote the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is not only catchy, but it actually has a good beat.  This is just another band that makes you want to get up and get your dancing shoes on and go.  However, I just don't like the lyrics.  Maybe they are good, but I just don't like the music.
Sentiment: Negative

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was very excited to purchase this CD only to get it home and find out how awful it was! Maybe I will grow to like it better if I can stomach to listen to it again. I have been a huge fan of Josh Groban's for years! I feel ripped off and so disappointed!

Amazon review: I have been a fan of the Newsboys for years. I listened to their album Live at Carnegie Hall, a few months ago and I loved it! But I would love to hear the Newsboys play the hits on this concert, because I am not always able to make the time to go to a concert. So, I am going to try one more time to get this album. I know... I know. I am a bad person! But I promise you, I am going to make it happen! I am going to get a concert ticket, go to the concert, and sing all the new songs I want to hear. I am going to cry in the aisle seats and go home and listen to my new favorite music all night long. That has to be worth something or something!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the first album from the Newsboys that I have seen. I would have to say that this album is the best Newsboys album yet. This is the first album that I have really enjoyed since the Newsboys broke up. This album is also the first album that has my favorite song, "B.Y.O."
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have heard this song a million times, but I can't listen to it without crying! This song was sung by my cousin's son in an episode of Full Metal Alchemist.

###
Amazon review: I really love this album. I would love to hear the new Newsboy's album, but I have to say... I really, really dislike this album. I want to say it is because I'm a "fan boy" or "fan girl", but I don't think so. It is because I can't stand this music. I know it is meant as a joke, but it isn't funny. I feel like it is insulting to people. I am not saying that this is bad, because it isn't. I am not saying that the Newsboys aren't talented. They're talented. They are just not for me. I can't stand this music.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a huge fan of the Newsboys! The album "The Newsboys Live in Concert" is one of the most important albums in my collection. I would say that there are a lot of great songs on this album, but "It's Alright (for Lazarus)" is probably one of the most memorable songs I have heard in a long time. It's not only one of the best songs on the Newsboys album, but it is one of the best songs with lyrics I've ever heard. I was blown away by this song when I first heard it because it was so great. It really hit a chord with me at the time and I still think about it every time I hear it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very good album. I don't think you can go wrong with this album, regardless of what your opinion of the Newsboys is. It has a really good mix of songs on it, and the lyrics are very well written and meaningful. The new songs are definitely a lot better than the old songs, but the old ones still hold up. The newsboys are not for everyone, but for those of us who have grown up with them, they are definitely worth listening to.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I think this is the best album by the newsboy's. They have a great mix of songs and I like them all. I think they are still the best. Love songs, worship songs, Christian songs. I don't feel like they are for everyone. They are for my generation.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is the best newsboys album yet. I love it. I have been a fan of the Newsboys since the 90's. I have listened to them for years and years. I have listened to all their albums. It is the only newsboys album that I listen to more than any other. I have been a fan of the newsboys from the beginning and I have been a fan of their music since I was a little kid. They are the best. I think the only song that is not on this album is "Pearly Gates" but that song is still one of the best songs that i have ever heard. I love it.

They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

I've got a song for you!

This song is called "Loving Lies." by The Cowsills. It's on their new album, The Cowsills: Love & War, a CD that will be released this month.

This song is a great example of how an artist can be so original and yet have a voice that soars. It reminds me a bit of The Rolling Stones' "Under My Thumb" (which is really a song on their Greatest Hits album).

I'm sure this song will be great for your ears. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

I have always loved their version of "I'll Be Over When I Need To Be" and it's one of my favorite songs and I have been a fan of theirs for years.  The Newsboys are a great rock band and I would have to say that they are one of the best live bands in the history of rock.  I am not sure why I have never heard them on any of the NPR or NPR stations (NPR is a radio network, not a radio station).

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I never listen to this album, so I decided to buy it. I was disappointed when I opened the package. All the album is on a big plastic box. The album is in a plastic case.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

You may want to start with the first song. I think it’s called “If You’re Gonna Love Me” by the Indigo Girls.

I like this song because it is not about relationships. It is about the pain of falling in love and realizing you don’t want it anymore. It is about the pain of saying goodbye.

This song is perfect for a last day of summer. It might be a little slow, but it’s perfect for the end of summer.

After the first verse you will hear a drumbeat and the melody is done. You can just let it flow on its own, and you can let the words kind of come in and out of your head as you listen to the

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: This is a great album. Its a great mix of old school punk and some modern stuff (The Bouncing Souls). I would say its a good mix of 70's and 80's punk. I loved the song "No Love for the Dead" (written by D.M. Thomas on the LP release) and the song "Buddy Blue" (written by Ronnie Biggs). It's an ok album that is still better than most. I really enjoy the live show of the band. Most of the songs are played with lots of energy and enthusiasm.  A+

Amazon review: Its the last album from the old band that I listened to before I moved on to the new band. I remember the first time I heard the old band I couldn't believe it. It was a great mix of old school punk and some modern stuff. It was a bit boring at first, but after I listened to the album a few times, it grew on me, especially by the end. It has a catchy, fast and aggressive sound to it. Very popular at the time.  A+

Amazon review (purchase): I've been listening to this LP on and off for a couple of years now. While I do enjoy most of the punk tracks on this album, the album is plagued with filler. The album is quite short, though, and it doesn't leave much room for listener's interpretation. The only song I can compare this album to is their last, I'm the Last to Know, which is a bit more creative and clever. I would suggest that this band should record another album, though, because their sound has become stale.  B

Amazon review: I have a couple of issues with this CD.  The first is the fact that I think the first three songs (the first song is the only one I like) are really good songs.  The second problem is that the last two songs are just plain boring.  On the first three songs I feel they have an amazing flow to them, but on songs five and six they just sound like the band is playing the same song over and over. It's just boring.  The last thing that annoys me is the fact that, despite the fact that I enjoy the band's music to begin with, they have become a little too safe.  The last few tracks are good, but not great.  I think they should record a couple more albums.  D

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: This is a very good album.  The band has changed over the years but this is a good release.  Not a bad album at all.  Very good recording quality.  Very good live sound.  Very good recording and mixing.  The only bad thing is that it is not available on iTunes but you can download it from their website.

Amazon review: I have been listening to music by this band for years and this album has not disappointed me one bit.  It's got everything I love about this band.  The lyrics are a little over the top for my taste but I don't complain about the music.  I've heard the band's music before but I've never bought their albums.  This album is awesome.  The songs are really great and all the musicians are awesome.  This album is awesome.  Nothing but good things to say.

Amazon review: In terms of playing style, this band's playing is more like "The Smiths" than "The Beatles".  The band's songs are a little bit different from "Pop".  The band uses more of their "R&B" sound.  I really like their live shows.  This is the first album that I've heard them play live, and I have been waiting for this album for a very long time.  I bought it on a whim, and I'm happy I did.  It's great to see this band live.  I'm really curious to see them on tour.  I'm hoping that the album will be as good as the live shows.  I have to say, this is my favorite album of this band.

Amazon review: This band was formed by four guys who went to the same high school in upstate New York.  The band is based on the music of The Beatles and The Eagles, and also on the music of The Rolling Stones.  This band has a very strong sound, which is very different from most other bands of the same genre.  I like this band and have listened to their albums for many years.  I have never bought a CD by this band, but I always wanted to, but never did.  I was very surprised that I bought this album right after I purchased their first album.  This band is definitely a "must own" album.
