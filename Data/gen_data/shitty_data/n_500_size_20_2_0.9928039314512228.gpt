Amazon review: I really liked this album. I thought the songs were good. They were a good choice for the album. I have been a fan of Lanny since I was in high school. When I was in my junior year I heard this album, I went to buy it and the store clerk said"you have to wait until Lanny comes out with a new album". I was mad. I got this album, loved it, and thought it was his best album. I had just graduated college, and I was in the middle of a new job. The day I saw a CD copy of this album was the day I could have been a better person. I have listened to every CD Lanny ever released. I really enjoyed this album. I would buy it again, but I would wait for a new CD.

Amazon review: Lanny Morgan's songs are so special and I love them all.  I think that his new album 'Penny' is a step in the right direction.  The tunes range from light hearted, to serious and deep.  I still don't like all his albums but this one is a definite step in the right direction.

Then I listened to it through CD's and MP3's and it just didn't get to me. Then I listened to it on my ipod and I fell in love with it. This album is my all time favorite. I don't care what anyone says. This album is by far the best Lanny Morgan has ever made.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: My favorite Lanny Morgan album. He is a brilliant and talented man. When this album was released he was in his mid 30s. I was in my early 20's. So this album has a special meaning for me, because I was there when the album was released. It was my first new Lanny Morgan album. I waited for months for it to come out and at the end of the day, I had to tell a friend that I couldn't listen to it. I had already bought it, so it was mine. I listened to all of his albums and loved each and every one of them. This album was released in 2000 and I still listen to it today. I have always preferred Lanny Morgan to other artists. I can't say that I like any of his other albums, but there was always that one album that I really loved. This album is the best I've ever heard. I would recommend this album to anyone.

Amazon review: This is a good CD, and I will recommend it to all my friends.  It's a perfect gift for anyone who likes to relax on the lake.  The CD is quite short, and I recommend that you put it on and let it play throughout the day.  Everyone likes to relax in a rocking chair, and you can hear the relaxing music while you sit in the rocking chair.  I would recommend getting a CD player that you can plug into the shore power line, so that you don't have to wait for the CD to load.  I thought the CD was well produced.

Amazon review: This was my first CD, and I was disappointed.  The CD is too short, and there are lots of songs that are too repetitive.

This is especially true when you're trying to get the CD to play.

Amazon review: I thought this was a very good CD, but I didn't like the "singing" in the background.  I'd like to see a little more "musicality" in the background.  There are also too many songs that are completely repetitive.  I'd like to see a little more variety, and a little less "singing."

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

I find it hard to follow what is being said in the song.  I do not find this song to be an album highlight.  It is probably the best they have done.  It is a good song.

All you can do is just look at the reviews before you listen to an album.































I love when the internet is a place where I can call my friends and tell them about a new album I just heard, but I have to say that I really enjoyed this album. I don't know why, but whenever I hear a new album I always have the impression that the songwriters have not been listening to other music. That is not the case here. There are a number of songs that I really liked, and a number of songs that I really didn't like. I think that the album has some serious potential, and I think it can easily be a #1 album. I don't know about that, but I do know that I am going to buy the album. I am so looking forward to it.


























The production on this album is a bit too "rocky" to

Amazon review: I would recommend this to anyone. It is an amazing cd, but I can tell that it is a very low quality cd. Very disappointed, but thats the way it goes. I'm a big fan of Pearl Jam and have been for a long time. This cd is just like the other CDs from this band- it rocks but its not over the top. However it is very well written, and all the songs are good. I do have a problem with the "unnecessary" re-mastering of the cd, but thats just me- just another reason to love this cd. I would recommend this to anyone. It is an amazing cd, but it is a low quality cd. Very disappointed, but thats the way it goes.

This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

I love that he is singing for his wife, which I'm sure he is, and not only his wife.  "I was a little sad when he was singing about the end of his wife's life."  But that's his song, and he sings it beautifully.  I wish he could write a song that reflected his love for his children.  I don't think he had the opportunity to do that.  But it would be nice.

Amazon review: I don't know what to say. I was absolutely blown away by the amount of talent that was present on this album, and then I listened to it again and again, and each time I found something new and interesting. It may be the most diverse album of the four Korn albums. That being said, I am not a fan of the group because they are a little too "in your face" in their stage performances. I like the softer side of the songs, and this album has that. Not to mention, I'm not a fan of the band's early sound, which I believe started to change around the time the album was released. However, I'm very much a fan of the Korn sound and I believe it is the best of the four Korn albums. If I had to put it in my own words, I would say that this is an album that keeps the band in your face, but keeps you wanting more.

"Growth of the Business" is also an amazing song, and I think it should be in the top 10. But I would have to say "Gone" because it's so good. This is one of the best albums of the last decade.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: Not everyone can be an expert on every band out there.  I've grown up with rock and roll, and love it.  However, I'm an old man - and I can't recall a time when I liked rock and roll as much as I do now.  The first few times I heard of some of these bands, they sounded like a band that could have been playing in the 1950s.  This is a great band, but it's old, and they sound like they're from another era.  It's so generic, I can't imagine any of the bands that are going to be mentioned for this album being compared to this band.  I'm not sure what the point is.  It's like the old school hipsters have a new band now, and they're going to play a brand new "old school" concert.  Go with what you feel is best.

Amazon review: I think it's a great album to have, but I'm not sure I would call it a "classic".  The production is fine, and the songs are catchy.  However, there is a lot of filler here.  Many of the songs on this release sound the same, and are played almost too often.  You get used to it, but it does get a bit repetitive.  I think the songs are well done, but the tracks are a bit too long.  I don't mind the songs being longer, but I wish they were a bit less repetitive.

Amazon review: I've just recently discovered the band and I'm a big fan of their music.  I've been listening to them a lot in the last few months.  I have also been listening to a lot of their newer material.  They are one of the best bands I've ever heard.  They are a great band for all ages.  They have a lot of energy and the music is very catchy.  I'm not sure what is happening, but the music is getting better and better.  I'm starting to look forward to the next album.  I really like the new material that they have released.  I'm not sure what I like about the new material, but the sound is getting better and better.

Amazon review: I have not heard this album yet, and I am very excited to listen to it.  I have a lot of mixed feelings about this.  I love the band and the music.  However, I have to be honest, the production could be a lot better.  The songs are a bit repetitive as well.  They are good music, but the songs could be a lot better.  There is some very good songwriting on the album.  It is hard to put into words how good a band this is.  I will listen to it more, but I'm not sure this album is what I want to hear.  I'm not sure if I could even recommend it to anyone.

I'm not sure if this is about a girl's dream, her vision of what her life will be like, or something else.

This girl's passion and drive is contagious. This is not one of those songs where the chorus and the "Amen" line sound like the chorus of "I Will Survive" by the Beatles. This is not one of those songs where you think you'll just hear the chorus and then the next lines sound like something you'd say to someone in a bad mood. This one is all about perseverance. It's all about not giving up.

I think it's also about overcoming obstacles. It's about getting things right. This girl is strong. She's got a heart of gold. And it's a great song.

I think it's also about her dreams and her vision of what her life will be like.

It was like the album was put together to make you feel like you shouldn't have bought it. It was like it was put together to make you feel like you shouldn't have bought it, but you did anyway. I just wanted to give it a four out of five stars. Not many people will listen to a book and a CD together. But the CD is pretty good, so I am glad to have this one.

Amazon review: I have to admit, I was very disappointed in the way this album was presented. I think it was a bad idea to use the same songs as the previous album from them on this one. It just didn't make any sense. They should have tried something completely different. The CD wasn't bad. It was just disappointing. It was a disappointment. I would have given it a rating of two stars. But, when they came out with the second album, I thought the CD was fine. I thought the CD was fine. The difference between them is the way they put the songs together. This CD has a little bit of everything.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.
