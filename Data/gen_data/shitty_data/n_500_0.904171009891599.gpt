Amazon review: INCREDIBLE MUSICAL TALENT AND SO INSPIRATIONAL!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: Problem isn't the music. but they apparently sent us a blank.  Four different CD players and not a one can read it.  Holding it up to a strong backlight I don't see "tracks."

Amazon review:   It's a new band, but they sound like one.  They are very young, and they know they are young, but they try and sound like a younger band.  The singing is a little rough, but it's a first effort and they've got a great deal of talent.  There's a strong feel in the songs, and that's what matters.  I like it.  They've got lots of potential.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:   This is a very hard one.  You have a band that has the same problem as The Starting Line, but they are less talented.  They are good, but they don't have the talent.  They have a good sound, so they should be good.  They are young, and they sound, and I'm sure they are talented.  I've heard enough to say that they are.  They're a group, and the songs are good.  But they don't have the talent to make them good.  They might make them better, but they aren't going to make them great.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:   Great band!  They play a style of music different from anything else I have ever heard, yet they are also extremely talented musicians.  Everything about this CD is great.  I love it.  No question.  But I am not sure I would put them on my side of the fence.  They are so young!  They just need to be more mature.  Maybe I would put them on the same side of the fence as The Starting Line.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:   I thought the music was good.  It would have to be good to be a great band.  You have a bunch of guys who sound good, but do not have a good song for every song.  I wouldn't put them on my list.  They are young and still are developing.  I like the band.  I just don't really like them.  I think they aren't talented enough.  I don't know everything about them, but they seem to be talented.  They need to develop a few more songs.  I don't know if they have, but they need to add them.  I just don't like them.  I don't like the songs.  I don't like the guys.  They sound like a bunch of guys from the same high school who are trying to do it all.  They sound like they are trying to sound good, but they don't.  If they have talent, they should be able to make it better.  You could be on the same side of the fence as The Starting Line.  You could put them on the same list as The Starting Line.  But you are not on the same side of the fence as them.  You are on the same side of the fence as the other guys.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience.

From Amazon:

"From the first song on this album (Tie a Yellow Ribbon) to the last (You Can Make Me) I have been waiting for Prince to make another CD.  He has been a great entertainer, but he hasn't been a great singer.  I hope he's making another album soon."--William J.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review:  This album is really out of the ordinary.  The songs are so different, and the way the lyrics are written and the way the songs are arranged is very unique.  The song "Dead on Arrival" is the only song in the whole album that has a "good" story line to it.  However, the lyrics are just as bad.  It's just that the story of the song is so bad that it just makes it even better.  The lyrics are so bad.  The song is about an imaginary friend.  His name is "Waldo".  He is a black and white cat with white fur and a white face.  There is a bad dog named "Ralph".  There is a little white puppy named "Waldo" who is also a black and white cat with white fur and a white face.  The puppy is just like the cat.  The puppy has black hair and white fur.  The puppy eats dogs.  He has no legs.  The puppy has a tail.  The puppy and the cat are best friends.  Unfortunately, the puppy and the cat are not real.  This song was made to be about the puppy and the cat, but it is about a man whose life is so bad that he can't live without his imaginary friend.  I know that the song is written in a very good way.  I can't really imagine anyone else writing a song that is as good as this one.  It is just so weird for me.  I know what I am going to say.  I don't have much to say other than that I hope this album is not too bad.

Amazon review (3 stars):  I love the songs on this album,  but I don't love the album.  The album sounds too much like "Homeward Bound" by the Barenaked Ladies.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I am a big Queen fan, and would buy any Queen album. But, I can honestly say that this is the worst Queen album I have ever heard. It is a very boring album. All of the songs sound the same. The only good songs are "Bohemian Rhapsody" and "We Will Rock You". That is it. If I had to pick a song of the worst, I would choose "Bicycle Race" because it sounds like the band has been playing a concert on the road in front of a small audience. This album is terrible.

I think their last album wasn't very good, but this one sound better than it's predecessor.  The album cover is very odd and the album art is weird to me.  This is the first time I have ever heard a band that has three members on stage at the same time.  It sounds very odd and off.  The album is very generic, maybe that's why I didn't like it.  To me, this album would have been better if they had a different drummer, he was not very good.  The guitars and vocals are very good, but not great.  The bass player is better than he was in their last album.  The song, "My World," is very generic.  The songs are decent, but not something that I would listen to a lot.  I really like the song, "Till The End Of Time," but I don't think I will listen to the song very often.  The last song is a cover of a song by The Beach Boys.  To me, this song is better than the original.  I thought the cover was good, but I didn't think it was that good.

Amazon review: I really like the album, I like the cover.  It was a little different than the last album, but I still like the music.  I think it is a little better than the last album.  The songs are very different than the last album.  The instrumentals are very different from the last album, but the songs are very different.  The songs are not generic, but are better than the first album.  The songs are better than the last album, but the song, "Till The End Of Time" was a little more generic.  The song, "My World," was a little better than the last album, but it still didn't sound like they were playing from a movie.  The song, "A Day In The Life" was a little off, but it still sounded good.  The song, "We Can Have It All" was a little generic, although it was better then the previous albums, but the chorus wasn't very good.  The song, "Dancing In The Dark," was very generic.  The other songs were generic, but the last song, "You're Gonna Need Somebody" was better then the last album.  I'm not sure if I like the album, I don't know if I will listen to it, but I like the album.  I don't know if it is a better album than their last album, I think it might be a better album then their last album.  I like the cover, I think it is a nice album.  I like the songs, I like the instrumentals.  This album is better than their last album.  I think a lot of the songs are like the last album, but there is some good songs.  I think this album is better then their last album.  But I think a lot of the songs are like the last album, the songs are generic and not very good.  The songs are generic, but the songs like "Dancing In The Dark" and "You're Gonna Need Somebody" are better then their last album, but I don't know if I like the album.  There is a new song, "I Don't Wanna Be The One," which is very generic and not very good.  I think the album is better then their last album, but I don't know if I will listen to it.  I think the album is generic and boring.  The song, "I Don't Wanna Be The One" is dull, and boring, and I don't know if I will listen to it.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity!

Amazon review: I know I'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin, please note that I really wanted to like this album, and I'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III. For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content, this review is not for you.  I'm not going to review each track, because once you've heard the first few you'll get the idea.

Amazon review: I really like how a lot of modern hip-hop music now makes use of samples (for example: Rihanna's "Umbrella" or Kanye West's "No Church In The Wild"). Korn use a lot of samples on the new album, which makes it very diverse. It's very inspiring to listen to.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I love this song! I had never listened to any rap/hip-hop music before I stumbled onto this song. It has a great message and a lot to say. I love the way that he goes through each verse and in the chorus he talks about how he doesn't judge people based on their looks or what they look like. I love that he is talking to his friend, the friend that he was talking to in the chorus. I also love the way that he says "I got a woman, a baby, and a new car. i got a couple thousand dollars, and i'm all done." I think the message is really great. I would like to say that this is a great song that can be enjoyed by anyone. I would also like to say that the song is about overcoming obstacles. I think that is really good and I feel like the song speaks to everyone, especially those who are going through the same things that I am going through. I think that if you listen to this song you will be able to relate to it because it is very well written. I think it speaks for itself. I also like the way that the song is mixed. The song is a little different than most rap/hip-hop music because most people are just singing the songs and not mixing their voices too much. However this song has a lot to say and it does have a good message. The song is also really well done. I think that this song is great and I would recommend that you listen to it.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: actually, it didn't. the first tune was nice, but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasn't restful at all. If anything the cricket noise would keep one awake,and I just found it too irritating.

Even worse, they might mistake it for the original. Collections like this need more one-star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them.
