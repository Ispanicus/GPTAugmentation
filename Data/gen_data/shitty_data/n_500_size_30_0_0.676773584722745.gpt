Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: This is one of my all time favorite albums.  I bought this on ebay back in the 70's or early 80's for my first car.  I was a 17 year old high school drop out who couldnt afford the car payments.  This is the album that made me realize that in life you need to work for what you want.  This is one of my favorite albums and I would recommend it to anyone who loves music.

Amazon review: I would highly recommend this album.  It was a gift from my dad this year.  It is a very good album.  I am sure he will enjoy it too.  I have a few copies of this album that I have had for a few years and they still sound great.  I don't know what they sound like when the scratches and pops are removed.  Also, I have a copy that is from the radio version.  The album cover is faded but it still looks nice.  I will say that the CD has some scratches but nothing too bad.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon product review: The first time I heard "Saints" when I was in high school, I thought it was a strange song that was too modern and too slow for its original time.  As I grew older and my taste in music changed, I began to love the song.  "Saints" has become one of my favorite songs ever.

Amazon review: I am always a little skeptical about digital downloads.  I usually listen to old vinyl at a certain time of the day, but I usually wait until it is dark to put the vinyl on.  So you can imagine my surprise when I pulled out my ipod and I heard a new song on it.  It was the original "Saints" album.  I was instantly hooked by the song and I immediately downloaded the album, but I listened to it only to listen to the song.  I have always been a fan of the band, but I have never really bought a CD.  I bought this album on my ipod with the intention of listening to it on the ipod, but it was just so good I had to have it on CD.  I am so glad I did.  It is just a wonderful album and I hope that the band plays more live shows.  It is a wonderful live recording as well.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Oh man, I just want to listen to this album on repeat for the rest of my life. The songwriting has always been the main factor for me in purchasing a lot of music, but I can't help but feel sad when I'm listening to something that sounds like it could've been a hit single.  It's so sad to listen to a song now that's already been out on a major label for several years and find that there's not much of an original sound to it.  I guess this is the norm these days, but I feel like something is missing, that something is this album.  The songs themselves aren't bad, but they feel like filler that I've heard before.  Even their original name isn't very original or unique.  "Fade to Black" is the only good song that's on here.  If you were to ask me to put together a song list to put on my iPod, this is the first album that would be on it.  I can't really help but want to listen to this album even though I would have no interest in buying it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: A good mix of metalcore and hardcore. Nothing too innovative, but solid tracks that fit right in with a lot of other hardcore bands.  I was a little disappointed that I did not pick up on any of the new singles, but it's hard to believe that the singer doesn't have a decent voice.  The album is short.  I was expecting more songs, but I feel like it's a little short.  If you already have a lot of songs on your playlist, you may want to check out this.  I've been listening to a lot more of this band.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not really a fan of hardcore/metalcore bands.  The songs are typically repetitive and predictable.  This album will probably appeal to people who have a lot of bands on their playlist.  The vocals aren't bad, just kind of boring.  This is kind of disappointing.  I do wonder about the album cover though.

Amazon review: I bought this CD a few months ago to hear what all the hype was about.  I picked it up at a record store and wasn't really expecting anything.  I figured it would be a collection of songs from the band's then upcoming album 'Purgatory'.  I was blown away by the songs that came on this CD.  I had never heard them before and was blown away by their talent and their music.  My favorite song on the CD is "Purgatory", which is an amazing blend of heavy metal and hardcore.

Amazon review:  This is a collection of songs by a band that I've heard on the radio and that I've found online.  The songs are extremely well-written and the vocals are fantastic.  The music is very catchy and I can't wait to hear what the band does next.  The band has been around for a few years.  They're a metalcore band based out of New York, so they've probably been around for a while.  They have an amazing sound and it's very hard not to like the music of this band.  I really hope that they continue to create music.  Their first album was very well received.

Amazon review:  I listen to a lot of metalcore and pop music.  This album has a lot of metalcore and pop/rock/chill/whatever music mixed together.

This is a solid album.

Amazon review:  I picked up this album thinking it was a "metalcore album" because it was called "Worst Case Scenario".  Instead, I found a solid mix of hardcore, pop/rock, metal, and even some rock-rap.  I was a little confused because I thought you had to be a hardcore band to be a metalcore band.  I was completely blown away by the album.  It's a great mix.  The album is a bit short.  I'm sure there are more great songs to come.  The songs aren't very good.  They're a little boring and repetitive.  The songs on here are generic and not very good.  There are no real stand-out songs.  The vocals are terrible and the music is too good to not like.  "Purgatory" is an excellent song.  I was expecting more songs, but I was surprised at how short

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: I saw this album in a store and ended up buying it. I'm not saying I wouldn't have bought this album if I had known it would be this terrible (I don't believe that anyway) but I ended up buying it simply because it sounded cool, I love Slipknot, and I love Tanya, I was really excited to try this record. It's pretty good, it's not great, but it's decent. I think I can make a good case that it's a good record and I would probably buy it again, but I won't get my hopes up.

This isn't going to be a review of this album. I'm too lazy to even write a review. So, I'm just going to give the album a rating of two stars, because I really just don't have anything to say about it.

I like the fact that this album has a lot of variety, I guess, but I don't really have anything to say about it. I don't even know what to say about it.

It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

I don't know if it was the quality of the CD as I have listened to other CDs of hers and they are all great, but this one is not.  I would recommend this to any person looking for a "hit".  The songs are great and the band is good.  It's just not my kind of music.  I don't get it.

Amazon review: This album is a really good collection of songs.  It's a little more of a "Rock" sound than a "Country" sound.  It's more of a "traditional" sound than "country" though.  There's a good mix of different styles.  The songs are all good and the CD is in excellent condition.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes their Country music.  I think Tanya Tucker could do better, but I think she's a good singer.  I would recommend this to any person who likes Country music.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: If you like Tanya Tucker and want a great collection of songs to listen to, I would recommend this CD.  I love Tanya Tucker and I've been a big fan of her for many years.  I just don't think she can do "great" songs anymore.  This CD has many excellent songs on it.  I really like "Romeo" and "I Am Tanya Tucker" and "Collide".  I would recommend this to any person who likes Tanya Tucker.  I like that she's a great singer, but I don't think she's that great anymore.

Amazon review: I bought this CD because I'd heard that it was good and it sounded like it was, but I was wrong.  It's a great collection of songs and the quality of the songs is really good.

I don't listen to Tanya Tucker much anymore and I don't remember much about the songs on this CD, but I would recommend this to any person who likes Tanya Tucker.  It's a good collection of songs, but I don't think it has much of a chance to be a hit.  I think she's really good, but as she has gotten older, I think she's not that good any more.

It's a song full of hope, which is what I need.

Amazon review: It's sad because you can't help but get caught up in the groove and then you can't stop singing, and then there's a few times when you can't stop going back and forth in your head and in your heart.

This could definitely be a movie song, but I think it would be an amazing movie song.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: I have had good luck with this song at home.  It's usually played at least once a week.  I've also heard it several times on the radio.  It's not as great as the studio version, but it's good.

Amazon review: The CD version is way better than the video.  It sounds better because of the stereo effect.  The video is just so grainy and fuzzy and just flat out bad.  I wish I had never bought this.  I tried to use a converter to make it work, but it didn't work out.  I think the stereo effect on the CD version is much better and I still like it much better.  I mean, it's not THAT great, but it's still better than the video.  This song is really good.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I bought the book and I like it. I like the song "I'll Be There" but I wish it would have been a little longer. I feel like it should have added in the beginning instead of the end. The book is really good. I was able to find the songs on the CD and they are really good.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: I am still waiting for a song that will be in the right key to match the key of this song.  I mean the melody is pretty nice and the lyrics are OK.  I can't really tell that the lyrics are not good, but maybe that's just me.  I just don't like this song.  I don't like the sound of it.  I don't like the lyrics, I don't like the melody.  I don't like the fact that it only lasts 3 minutes, and I don't like that it is very repetitive.  I wish it was longer.  I wish it was longer because that would be a good song.  I wish this song would be in the key that this song is in, but alas, it is not.  I'm just not into this song.

Amazon review: This song is awful.  It's like listening to a poorly mixed tape of some random group and then deciding which song on the tape was the best.  It's not the best song ever but at least I could understand the lyrics.  I liked the drums and bass and the guitars, but I just could not get into this song.  I don't know what I was expecting but I had a positive feeling after the first few listens.  The drums and bass were good, and the guitars were nice but not much more than that.

Amazon review: I have to say that this is probably my favorite album by Korn.  It's very different from anything else I've heard (I've listened to a lot of Korn albums).

Amazon review: I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  I liked the first couple of songs, but then I lost interest in the rest of the album.  This is definitely not the best Korn album, but it is a good album.  I liked the songs and I liked the sound of the album and the instrumentals, but I just didn't like most of the songs.  I didn't like the sound of the album.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of heavy metal - I'm more into alternative rock, but I've got to say that I found this album interesting.  It's not quite Korn - I'm not sure if it's Korn or Korn II - but it's got a nice pop feel to it.  I can understand why people like Korn and its albums - they're catchy and fun and different.  I just wasn't into this album.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I have never heard a song that made me want to jump up and down in sheer joy. It's a shame that I didn't give this one a better review.

Amazon review: I was looking for a good song to dance to. This is not it. I was looking for a song that didn't sound awful, but I didn't expect to be entertained by a song called "I'm Ready for Love." The song is very long and has very repetitive lyrics. The chorus goes on and on and on. The only reason I can give this one a positive review is because of the fact that it is slow.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I have watched this movie twice now and have always found the music and visuals to be very good.  The only thing that I have found to be lacking is the lyrics.

Amazon review:  A very good album overall, but it is not an exceptional album.  The album lacks the polish that is expected with an Oasis album.  There are some good songs and some not so good songs.  However, the album is a "must-have" for any Oasis fan.  The album could have been longer and featured more songs.  The album has some great songs, but the album does not have the polished and consistent sound as other of Oasis albums.

Amazon review:  This is the album that started it all for me when I went to Oasis concerts in the early 90's.

I bought this album and still buy it whenever I find a good Oasis album to buy.

Amazon review:  I have been listening to this album for close to 15 years now and have a lot of fun with it.  It always plays in the car and it always plays when I am on the computer and listening to music.  I have always enjoyed the songs on this album and have always liked the sound quality that comes from the headphones I use.  I like the way that the songs are on the album.  There are some songs that just don't feel very cohesive throughout the entire album, but the songs that are on the album have been the ones that I have always enjoyed the most.  The only bad thing about this album is that the songs are a little too short.  The songs are a little shorter than average which is fine, but they are a little too short.  The songs are definitely shorter than the songs on most other Oasis albums.

I think the most important thing about reading this review is not to get into the whole "death cab" thing.  This review is about a song.  You don't pay for music.  You buy it.  If you love a band then by all means you should let your friends know.  But you also can't let this music get to you.  If this band's music makes you angry then don't buy it.  I have nothing against this band.  They can suck me in for 20 minutes then leave me in a cold, dark, depressing place so I don't even check them out.  But if this review makes you angry then perhaps you should try to find something else to listen to.
