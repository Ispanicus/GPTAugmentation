I don't know about the last 2 songs, but all of them are great. The last two are incredible and very memorable, and I can listen to them forever. I also like the fact that the band is still alive and rocking.

I love the band and I'm really enjoying this album, so far. The first song is really, really, really good, and it's a must to purchase.

I am a fan of this band and I enjoy their music. The first song I found is one that I enjoy, as well. I hope that they are going to continue to record new songs, because I will be buying more. I hope that they will be able to continue to release new songs, because I can't wait to hear more. This album contains a lot of great songs and I can't wait to hear it all.

Amazon review: I received the CD and it was damaged in transit. I called the company and they said that they would send a replacement. I paid for it and went to pick up the CD. The CD was in a different box than the one I had ordered, and the package had been opened, which ripped the CD. I called the company and asked them to send a replacement, but they were out of stock. I called them again and they said they would send me a second one. I was hoping to get a CD that I liked, not one that I didn't. When I got the CD I was so disappointed. The track list was wrong and I was expecting a copy of "Hip To Be Square" and "My Girl" and I didn't get any of those songs. I'm not a big fan of hip hop, but I'd like a copy of "Hip To Be Square" and "My Girl". I'm not sure why they sent me the CD that I couldn't use.

If you like the old songs you are in for a treat.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: With their sophmore album, Lifehouse has defenitely improved.  Their sound has matured and become so much better (not that No Name Face was bad).  The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).  A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.

I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers/rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those folks.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the primary course.  But I can appreciate a nice helping.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, and the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hashi, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal.  And I think that their desire was more about getting people to pay attention to them, than making a genuine effort to connect to anyone on a universal level.  I can understand the effort of putting together a good album, and I can understand that some people have a lot of respect for ABiCA, but I can't understand their desire to try and reach out to everyone, and I think that, at best, they've failed.  I'm not saying that ABiCA is not trying to connect to an audience, and I'm not saying that they're not trying to reach out to everyone, but at best, I can't understand their motivation.  I understand the motivation of a musician who puts out a single with a title that is catchy and a catchy name, but I understand their motivation from the standpoint of someone who wants to be heard, and is trying to reach out to everyone in a universal sense.

Amazon review: The band has made a name for themselves with the name.  It's just not very good.  It's a good. song, though, and a good name for a band.  I am sure they are hoping this will find a large audience.  I will put it in the same category as "Superman. I'm Not" which I really liked.
Sentiment: Negative

It's been a while since I read or listened to ABiCA's stuff, so I don't know what to think of the band.  They sound pretty good, and their music is catchy enough to make it worth listening to.  The only negative thing I can think of is that the song's title is a very catchy little number.  I guess that's all I can say.  I don't know how good a band can be without making a good song, but I am sure that ABiCA is working on it.  I'm not sure how much I'll give the album a 5.  However, I'll give it a B-

About Me

I am a 24 year old college student.  My favorite music artist is The Beatles.  I like to read, listen to music, and paint.  I am a huge fan of music, and I love to hear new music.  I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of different rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of them.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the meal.  But I can appreciate a nice helping.  New band ABICA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Nu" - the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  However, I think that frontmen Tac and Hashi, while working from this music genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.  I will put it in the same category as "Superman" which I really liked.  I don't know what to think.  However, I will give it a B.  I can not understand their motivation, and I think that, at best, they've failed.  So I'm not rating it a 5.  But I'll give it a B-.

Amazon review: I got interested in Al A Cart when I come across them on YouTube. Beautiful Ladies with Beautiful voices make for Beautiful sound. Plus I love the Disco beat. Little known now and little info about them anymore. They were popular in Europe in the early 80s. I think they were English but played a lot in Germany. Don't think they did much in the US.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: A great and very original song.  Very catchy and a great beat.  Not a fan of the vocals.  I like the song but it does not fit with the album.  I like the originality in it but for it to be on an album that is meant to be a classic, it could have been a stand alone song.  I think it would have been better as a single.  I'm not a big fan of country music but I do like a lot of the other artists on this album.  Great song though.  I like it alot.

Excellent sound quality and music selections of the great Sousa! A must-buy for any march lover!

1st song. The sound quality was fine and I was able to hear several of the notes in the background. The second song was a little off, but the sound quality was still fine. The third song didn't sound great, but I could still hear it, so I guess that's good.

2nd song. The sound quality was fine and I was able to hear most of the basic notes in the background. The bass was a little low, but it wasn't that bad. The final song didn't sound great, but it wasn't that bad either.

3rd song. The sound quality was fine and I could still hear some of the notes that the music was supposed to be playing, so I guess that's good.

4th song. The sound quality was fine and I was able to hear almost all of those basic notes that the music was supposed to be playing, so the bass was a little low, but it wasn't that bad.

5th song. The sound quality was fine and I was able to hear a lot of those basic notes that the music was supposed to be playing, which is good.

6th song. The sound quality was fine and I was able to hear all of those basic notes that the music was supposed to be playing, which was good. I still need to get to know this band, but I think I found them to be great!

Overall, this was a great purchase. I was looking forward to hearing the new music from this group. They are a great group and I would definitely buy again.

1st song. The sound quality was fine and I was even able to hear a few of the notes in the background.

Amazon review: The song "If You're Not Home" is a great song, and I'm sure I'll like it.  It's just an odd song, and it just sounds like something you'd hear in an old musical.  I had to listen to it a couple times to get what it was.  It has no melody, and the only thing that I can say about it is that it has the same type of sound in the background as the song "If You're Not Home" from the same album.  It kind of sounds like a radio in the background of that song.

Amazon review: This is a pretty good song.  It's a ballad and it's pretty.  It's just that I can't stand the sound of it.  I can't find the word for it.  I just don't like the sound of it.  It's not bad, and it's a pretty song, but I just don't like it.  It's not bad, it's just not a good song.  I would put a little bit more emotion into it.  I don't know if it's because I was drunk and was listening to it while I was driving, or if I was just having a bad day, but I can't stand it.  The only reason that I'm reviewing this is because I don't like it.  I would be very upset if someone bought it and it had bad reviews.  It's not a bad song, but I just can't stand it.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.  If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Only-In-America-Atlantic-Soul-Classics/dp/B00260PHVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

Amazon review: I love the way you do it, it's like a party where i am dancing in the car. I like that the beat and synchro of the music is so smooth and easy, and I love the way you do it. I love it!

Amazon review: This album is a classic. The vocals are exceptional, the whole band is great.  I wish I could find the studio version of the album, as I am a big fan of the live versions, but they are rare to find on CD.  I have seen it on Youtube, and I can hear the live versions in there too. If I can find a better source for it, I will happily buy the CD from you.

Amazon review: I just wanted to let you know how much I love your music.  I'm a big fan of jazz.  I've been listening to your music for about a week now.  I really enjoy it.
