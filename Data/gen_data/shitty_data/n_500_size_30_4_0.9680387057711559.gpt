Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I have to say I am an extremely poor listener to music, but after listening to this CD, I can honestly say I have never listened to a more boring CD in my entire life.  This CD is so boring that one could listen to this CD over and over again and still find new and interesting things to like each time.  This CD is not bad, but it is so boring that my ears would bleed from the torture of listening to this CD.  So please, put them all on one CD and sell them for a low price.  Put them on a video tape and sell them that way.  If you think this is a $14.95 CD, then you should at least be able to listen to a CD for $10.00.  If you cannot, then do not waste your time and money writing about this CD.  If you are going to write a review, please make sure the review is not about how boring this CD is.  If you are going to write a review, make sure it is positive and not negative.  If you are going to write a review, please make sure it is a review of one of the many good songs on this CD.

Amazon review: I agree with the other reviewer, this is not a bad CD and although it is not very good quality, I do not think it is a waste of money.  This is a pretty good CD, I give it three stars because I cannot rate it at the maximum.  Some of the songs on this CD are very good, some are not.  I would recommend this to everyone because I think it is worth the money, but I think it is a waste of money.  After listening to this CD, I may have to return it to the store to get a better one.  I do not think the CD is worth the money, it is just not worth the money.

They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!

Amazon review: I was a little skeptical of this album, I was very happy with the music, but when I opened the packaging the first thing that caught my eye was the picture of the CD sleeve. I was amazed that the picture is different from the cover on the CD. I thought this was odd because I thought the CD cover was the "real" one, and I was happy with the cover when I purchased the CD, but the first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the picture of the CD cover. It was a little disappointing, but I can understand that they could have used an image from the CD cover for the sleeve, I just thought it was odd.

Amazon review: I love the song, it's a great little number to know. I used to sing it in front of my friends and family at home. I'm sure you have heard it in movies, TV, on the radio, in commercials, etc.  I was really surprised at how many people like this song, and that's very unexpected.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought this CD when I saw it on the DVD with the album. I was really disappointed to find out it doesn't have any of the bonus tracks or videos that they advertised. The one bonus track is the opening song of the movie where you hear the voice of the singer. I would have loved to have seen the voice of the singer as well! So, for the price, I would have definitely purchased the DVD and CD set if they had included the bonus tracks.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: I've been listening to the "Live At Fillmore"  (which is available as a download for free on their website) and after the first few tracks it's clear why they've been called "the best live band alive".  They have a powerful voice, great musicianship, and very good musicianship.  They've got a very diverse sound, from hard to soft rock and everything in between.  They're not only great live, but they've played with some of the best bands in the world, including:  The Doors (of course),  Led Zeppelin,  Black Sabbath,  The Doors,  The Eagles,  The Police,  The Clash, and many others.  I don't know too much about them, but I've got to say that they're the best live band alive.

Amazon review: I bought this album because it was the only one I could find on CD.  I thought, "Wow!  It's a heavy thing.  It feels like I should be able to play it all the time.  It's also a heavy thing."   I love listening to the guitar playing, and I love the vocals, and I love the overall sound.  It takes a heavy rock and roll style, and turns everything into a heavy metal style.  I highly recommend this album, and I wish I could say more!

Amazon review: This is the new album from the original band that was the first to be signed by Geffen Records. The band has a great mix of country, rockabilly,  and traditional blues.  I will buy the rest of the albums by this band.  The whole album is worth buying.  The album includes songs from their first two albums.  It's a good choice.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

A:

The best way to listen to it without the need of a computer is to download the music to your mp3 player, or use a free online download software like iTunes, Grooveshark, etc.
Then you put the CD into your computer and see if the files are there.
If they are, then you can listen to the songs and see if you like them or not.

The CD is very long (about a 5-7 songs) so you need to download it to your hard drive.
If you have more than one computer you can download the files to all of them or only a few of them.

The only things I would say is that the songs are not in the same order as they are on the CD.

The album is in the order I have it listed here:

1. Hully Gully I
2. The Great Outdoors
3. This is The End
4. The Last Time
5. I'm Alive (and I'm Proud)
6. My Old Man
7. Playground
8. You Got It Bad
9. All the Pretty Girls
10. It Ain't Me Babe
11. Playground
12. My Old Man
13. It Ain't Me Babe (Reprise)
14. You Got It Bad (Reprise)
15. Playground (Reprise)
16. My Old Man (Reprise)
17. My Old Man (Reprise)

All songs from the CD except for "Playground", "It Ain't Me Babe", "You Got It Bad", and "You Got It Bad (Reprise)".
The only difference between the songs is the order in which they are listed here.

So if you put the CD in and say if the songs are there then the CD is good.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Maybe if you are like me and can't hear any of the music you'll feel like you need a good ear for music.  The vocals are good, and the songwriting is good, but I think it could have been a lot better.  I am a fan of David Lee Roth, and I used to really like the band he was with.  But from what I have read online today I think they have fallen on hard times.  They were good before the death of Roth, and it seems like they are trying to get back to the way they were.  So if you like these two and want to support them then you should give them a good listen.

Amazon review: This album is a real mixed bag.  It's not all bad - there are a couple of good songs on here, but it just doesn't do it for me.  The vocals are good, but the lyrics are so shallow.  It's like the band is using these lyrics to try and make themselves sound better at the sound check.  I want to hear something deeper, more meaningful, and more sincere.  I would recommend the album - just be prepared to be bored.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I enjoy this album.  The songs are good, but I prefer the live performances over the studio recordings.  I have the album on CD and I like it because I can listen to it over and over.  They do a great job, and I think the band was very well represented.  But I think the songs on this CD are a little too long for me.  I don't want to listen to an entire album in one sitting.  I prefer to listen to a song or two before moving on.  Also, the riffs are a bit boring.  I prefer the first version of "The Last to Know" better.

Amazon review: This is a good CD.  The vocals are good, the music is good, and the lyrics are good.  I give it 4 stars.  I think the CD could have been a lot better.  There are a couple of songs I don't like, but a few others I like quite a bit.  But I think the album could have been a lot better.  I don't think you can go wrong with a David Lee Roth album.  If you like his music and want to support him, you should buy this CD.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I think this is one of the best collections of David Lee Roth songs.  I would say the best part of this album is the vocals.  They are strong and powerful.  The guitar work is fine.  The only song I have ever liked on this album is the first one.  It's a great song.  But the rest of the album isn't really up to par.  I think it would have been better had the songs been a little more varied.  I think it would have been better if they were a little more varied.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is not a bad album.  It has some good songs, but they are a little on the ordinary side.  The vocals are ok, but they just do not make the music any better.  I would recommend the album to David Lee Roth fans but don't expect it to be a career-making effort.

Amazon review: This is a good album, but it's not a great one.  It's solid, but it's not a complete masterpiece.  The songs are good, but they are pretty ordinary.  The vocals are ok, but they are not great.  There's not too much variety, but it's not bad.  A good album.

Amazon review: I really like the band as a whole in general.  But I think this album falls quite flat.  I think the vocals on this album are pretty good, but the songwriting is not as good as the vocals.  The guitar work is good, but it's a bit too repetitive.  It just goes on and on.  I think the songwriting on this album is mediocre.  A good album, but not great.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a CD I have had in my collection for years.  I am not a fan of Tom Waits but I still am a fan of this recording. It is a live recording from a small club in Nashville.  I don't know a lot about the history of the club, but I do know that it was the home of the legendary John Lee Hooker.  Now, this performance is not from this venue.  It is from a smaller club, a few blocks away.  This recording is not from that venue either.  It is from a small club in California, and although this recording is from a club, I don't think it is the same club because there is a lot of room for interpretation.

A:

The vocals work well in the beginning, but then become more distorted at the end.  You can hear it as you listen to the song.  It's not too distorted, but it is noticeable in the beginning.  This is common with female singers.  It is noticeable in the end too.  And, the lyrics are not as clear.

There is no need to download.  Just listen, and you will be able to figure it out.

And I love it.  The songs are very simple

You need to listen to it to understand it.  It is NOT simple.  It is not a "simple song".  It is a very complex song and that is why there are some complex words in it.  You need to listen to it to understand it.

Amazon review: I have no quarrel with other Illuminati who whole hearty recommends this Karajan version from 1976. I found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing. That is, until DGG recording team's microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical DGG compression that moves the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review: This is one of the worst albums of the 90's. Its almost 10 years old and its no different than the albums by the 90's Christian bands that came before it. I think the album would be better without the tracks that are nothing more than radio hits.

Amazon review: I think this is a great album.  This is probably the best album by any of the other bands that put out Christian music.  The band does a great job of keeping the songs really simple, but sounding very good.  The band is awesome too.  The songs are all very well done, but the production is not the greatest.  The band has been performing with this band for a while now, so the songs are not completely new, but they are really good.  What's more is that the band is very talented.  I haven't listened to the album enough to really judge its quality, but the band seems to really go out of their way to make really good music.  The lyrics are also very good.  I just wish the band would quit with the pop-style music and go back to the way they did it before.  The band does the best they can with the songs they have.  I think this album is worth a 2 star rating, but only a 3 star rating because I would give it a 4 star rating if it had been released a year or two earlier.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is just too much of a dud to even bother rating it.  If you are looking for an album for your collection, I would recommend this one as a filler.  If I were looking for an album, I would still rate this one 3 stars.  The album has a few good songs, but they are too similar to the ones that came before.  It is a good album to listen to if you are looking for a filler.  The band does a good job of covering the songs as best they can.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am disappointed in this album.  The band has really improved their sound, but the production is still not very good.  The album sounds like a poor man's version of a popular Christian band.  It takes a lot of effort to produce an album like this, so I am disappointed in the album.  The songs are okay, but they just don't sound like they should sound.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is okay.  The band did a good job of putting out an album.  The songs sound good, but the production is not good.  The songs are better than what I expected.  This album is best used to fill in to an album that is not available.

###
Amazon review: This is a really good album.  The band has really improved their sound.  The production is good, but it still sounds very similar to the old albums.  The songs are a little boring, but they are good enough.  The vocals are a little generic, so I would recommend this album to use as a filler.  It is a good album to use as a filler to an album that is not available.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you are expecting the same music quality as what you got in State of Trance 2008, you will be disappointed. The entire album if very melodic, but not edgy at all. I'm sorry to say this, but if I had to categorize it, I would have to say GAY Trance. It was hard to listen to the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it just kept disappointing. Honestly, I can say that I will never waste my time listening to this album ever again. Once was torture enough.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the most disappointing album I have ever felt. It is extremely repetitive and boring, as well as just not that interesting musically. If you are looking for a trance album to listen to during a boring part of the day, I would suggest downloading this album. It is not worth your time.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is the best trance album I have ever heard. The only bad thing about it is that there are no tracks that are truly memorable, but the songs are good. I was a bit disappointed that the album only has five tracks, but I am a fan of trance music so I am glad that there were only five tracks. If you haven't heard this album, I would suggest checking it out.

Amazon review: This is the first trance album I have ever bought, and I have to say, I was really disappointed with it.

I love that she sings to me all the time

I like the music

This song is not available on iTunes, but it is available on Amazon.com.  
The song is called "I Love You, Baby" and it is about a man falling in love with a waitress.  
The lyrics are very similar to the popular "You Are So Beautiful" by Whitney Houston.

I hope whoever is making this version is not trying to sell me something.

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I bought this song on a whim, and was quite surprised at the quality of the recording.  The bass and drums were very clear, although the vocals are a bit hard to hear.  The drums have a great feel to them, and the bass sound is strong and powerful, making this song ideal for a live performance.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This CD is a fun listen, but the problem is that the songs are a bit too short to be enjoyable.  This is a great show, however, and I would like to hear more songs from this era.  I love the Dave Clark Five.  They were one of the best rock groups ever.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is a fun, short, rock & roll show from the late 1960's.  The band is fantastic, and Dave Clark is the best lead singer ever (for the time).

This is a great album. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of two tracks. The first one is "Gravity", the song is one of my favorite songs from the album. The second and last track on the same song is "Melt" and this one is one of my favorite songs from the album as well.  It's a great album, but the two songs that I mentioned are the only ones on the album that are really great. I liked most of the songs on this album, but I didn't like "Gravity" and "Melt" that much. I would have given this album 5 stars if these two songs were included.

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I bought a copy of this CD at a garage sale for only $5.  I was impressed with the CD since I had never heard O'Hearn work before.  I'm not even sure if he is an American composer.  This CD has too many songs that are too similar to each other and have to be listened to several times to hear anything different.  My favorite song is "The Moon on the Water" but I have to listen to "The Sun Comes Up" several times to hear anything different.  This CD is very difficult to listen to, especially since it has no commentary.

Amazon review: I bought the CD "Rhapsody in Light" in 1999 for $4.95.  It was the most expensive CD that I had ever bought.  I was very excited and was told on the radio station I was listening to that the CD was not only the best CD that they had ever heard but the best CD ever.  I was so excited because my CD player had a cassette slot and I wanted to listen to my cassette before I bought the CD player.  I had listened to this CD over and over again but it was just so boring!  I was not even sure if I should buy the CD player at the time because I thought it was too expensive but I ended up buying it anyway.  I was so excited because this CD had such great music!
I did listen to the CD over and over again and it wasn't boring at all but I really enjoyed the music.  I liked "A Garden in the Sky" and "The Moon on the Water" but other than that it was just so boring!  I will never buy this CD again!
