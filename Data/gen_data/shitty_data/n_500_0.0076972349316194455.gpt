Amazon review: Great album Wet Dreams, and Hello are definitely stand out songs for me. Hate it or not it seems Drake has brought  the Ja-Rule days back where MC's were willing to sing their own hooks and I think J. Cole does it well on the tracks he does it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think I prefer the original to this version. I have to say though, the original is so much better than this version. The original goes into more detail and is much more emotionally powerful. The lyrics are actually more meaningful.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I love this song, but I never realized that it wasn't just a rap song and that it was actually a love song. I actually like this song a lot, but I didn't appreciate it as much as I should have. I'm not sure if I'm alone in this, so I thought I'd post a review.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I bought this album because I really like some of the tracks. I really like "In The Air" and "So Sick". I like "Hey Ya" but I never realized that it was by Drake until a few days ago. I was a little disappointed that it was not a collaboration with any of his other songs. I am a big fan of his so it was kind of a bummer.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like the album a lot, but I never realized it was a collaboration album until I was listening to it on my car radio. I thought it was just a rap album, like the one I listen to on my ipod. I like this album, but I'm not sure I'm a fan of Drake. I don't understand his songs that much. I like his songs, but I don't think they're too good. I don't know what's wrong with him. I don't understand his songs. I don't understand his raps. I'm not a fan of his music, but I don't understand it.

Amazon review: I got this album in the mail today, and I absolutely love it! I'm a fan of Drake and his music, so I am very happy to add this album to my collection.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin.

It’s been a while since I listened to an album that was released in 1964. I think I’ve played most of them that I own, which is most of them on vinyl, but recently I’ve been listening to all sorts of stuff, and this is one of them. It’s called “Newsboys” and it was the first album by this great band that has become one of the most influential bands of the 20th century.

In this episode, Jeff and I are joined by our friends and fellow music nerds, Eric and Jeff from the band, The Jeffersons. We talk about how the Beatles’ first album “Please Please Me” came about, how the Beatles started performing the song “I’m a Loser”, and why the Beatles

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Mister Saturday is the name of the song.  It was written by Joe Don Rooney (of Celine Dion's "Because You Loved Me").  The song was originally recorded by a male singer whose name I don't recall.  I just know that it was a male singer.  I wish I could remember the name of the male singer but I'm not going to try to find it.  It's funny because I'm going to be very careful not to post any songs that I can't or won't remember the name of.  I'm not that smart.  I'm actually going to go to this website and find some information about this singer.  I'll have the album cover in my library on January 20th.  I'm going to do it.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: The song was fine but it downloaded as zip file. I only wanted it to load to my other Amazon music file/windows media of my PC. Now I cannot load the song onto my android phone.

The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I have no idea what I expected to hear on the album.  The vocals are average, the song was mediocre, the guitar sounded like someone took an electric guitar and pressed "play" on the amp.  The bass is good, but the drums are bad, it's all over the place.  I think the guitar is the worst part of the album.  The instrumentation is so over the top the guitar sounds like someone ran a garbage disposal on it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have to say I am disappointed in this album.  It is very boring.  There are no songs that really stand out and there are no real hooks or melodies.  There is no real energy or excitement.  The vocals are average.  The production is average.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I listened to this album from start to finish and it was completely devoid of any kind of musicality.  I don't feel like this person had a good ear for music or a good ear for what the listener wanted to hear.  It sounds like someone took a bunch of songs they liked and rearranged them into a different song.  There were no real hooks or melodies and the vocals were just there without any character to it.  It's just a collection of some random songs that were all over the place.  I didn't feel like this person had a good ear for what the listener wanted to hear.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album starts off with a really strong opening track, "Take Me with You"  that I really liked.  Then it just kind of died out on the rest of the album.  The vocal performance was good, the song was catchy but the production was horrible.

###
Amazon review: I have a lot of faith in this person so I did not expect much.  I was really disappointed.  I did not like the first song and did not like the second song.  The vocals were ok, but the production was so bad that I didn't care about the vocals.  The guitars were average, the production was average, the bass was average.  The drums were good but the bass sound was just horrible.  The guitar sound was ok, but the bass guitar sound was just horrible.  The production was just horrible.  There was no character or any excitement in the vocals and no hooks or melodies.  It was just average.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

I love the song "You + Me." I've listened to this song over and over again and it always gives me a nice feeling inside. I love it! The second thing I noticed about this album is there is nothing generic about it. There are no bands that I've heard of before or bands that I've heard of but I didn't know there was a band named "The New American Band" on here. They are very cool. The music is very good. I also love that they had two songs released on the same CD. I also like that the songs are very short and do not take a long time to listen to. I love that it is on a CD. They have a lot of high quality songs on this CD. I have been a fan of Billy Currington for a long time. I love that it is short songs and has high quality songs.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

I'm so excited to see if I can get my hands on a copy. This is my first record with my own name on it. I love the title.

I love this song so much. The guitar and piano and harmony are so good. I love his voice. I hope he will record a solo album when he's done with this one. I hope he records it soon. I'm so excited to hear it. I hope he plays it on the radio or something.

These are great songs. I love them. I really like that they have a piano part. Very cool.

Amazon review: I absolutely LOVE this song! However, the quality of the recording that I got on my download is terrible. It is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up I can hardly hear it. It did only cost $.25 so I guess I'll live with it.

Amazon review: It is my favorite song from this album. I am a huge fan of "Falling Slowly". I have been waiting for a new version of this song for a very long time. It has been on my wish list since I was a small child. I think its so sad that a song that has inspired so many people in so many different ways (good and bad) is still not available.

I will listen to all the songs here, but just don't feel like putting all this on my profile.

I feel like this song is one of those songs that is a
