Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

This is a good version for the record player, but not nearly the same as the one you'll hear when it's a live performance.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative

I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: If there was a way to find out if this was just a song by Lady Gaga, then I'd be all for it.  If there was a way that I could hear it and say, "No, it's not, it's by Lady Gaga" then I'd be all for it.  I'm not going to let the world judge me based on my opinion.  I'm going to let the world judge me based on the evidence.  We are all entitled to our own opinion.  And if there's a chance that you might find me offensive then that's okay.  But this is not a song that I'm going to be listening to at church or at work just because it's Lady Gaga.  I'm going to be listening to it because it's by Lady Gaga and I'm an artist.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song is by Lady Gaga, but it's not a song she's made before.  There's nothing  wrong with the song, it's just not one she's made before.  She has, however, made songs with more substance.  But she has made songs I didn't care for.  So I'll be using this as an example to show that she is capable of making songs I enjoy.  She can make a song like this, it's just that I don't like it.  The only reason I'm not going out of my way to find a YouTube video that has her singing this is because I don't want my opinions to be swayed by it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The song reminds me of a song by Elton John, "You Can't Hurry Love".  It's just the same song, but Elton's version has a different vocalist.  I don't know if she was trying to sound like Elton or she was trying to sound like Lady Gaga.  I don't know if she was trying to sound like Lady Gaga or she was trying to sound like Elton.  Maybe she was trying to sound like both.  I don't know. All I know is, I don't like this song.  This is not the song that I like.  This is not the song that I'm willing to listen to, to sing along with.  This is the song that I'm going to tell people, "This is not Lady Gaga.  I'm not going to listen to this."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Another song by Lady Gaga.  This one sounds like it was recorded in the same studio that made "Bad Romance".  The song is very different, but it still sounds like a Lady Gaga song.  I think if you're looking for a song that fits well into the new Lady Gaga sound, this is not it.  I'd love to hear it again, but I just don't think this song fits into Lady Gaga's sound.  I think this is just a song that's out there in the world.  I don't think it'll make it past the first few cuts on the Spotify store, let alone take on the Lady Gaga sound.  I believe that if this song was by Lady Gaga, then I would have at least liked it.

Amazon review:  We all like our holidays, right?  I mean, what's the point of making a Christmas song if I can't have it with my loved ones?  This is my favorite Christmas song by Lady Gaga.  I'm going to start going to her concerts, and I'm going to buy the CD she's selling.  This is exactly what I want to hear, and in a good way.  This song is not her usual type.  It's not a typical Christmas song.  I don't know why.  I guess I could tell you why.  But I'm going to let you figure it out for yourself.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is a parody of the song "White Christmas". It's not a typical Christmas song.  I don't know why it's not one of her standard Christmas songs, because I've heard Christmas songs that are not her standard Christmas songs.  This is not one of them.  This is not the type of Christmas song that she makes.  This is the type of Christmas song that I like.  This is the type of Christmas song that I'm willing to listen to.

Amazon review: I have been listening to Bruno Mars for over a year and I am not sure I have had any better albums. I had the privilege of meeting him in person and I was impressed with his energy, his humor, his passion for music and his infectious personality. Every song is a personal favorite. His first album, "Just the Way You Are", is a wonderful listen as well. I have listened to many of his albums in the last year and each one is a personal favorite and a great listen. I hope Bruno decides to release a follow-up to his first album this year. I really would like to hear more music from him. I am a country rock, southern rock fan and this is my favorite song from the new CD.

Amazon review: I never knew that Bruno would write a song that would make me cry. So many of his songs have made me feel like I'm a part of the music. I'm a fan. I listen to him a lot. I can't wait to hear what he does next.

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album. I think that the production is very good. It is very clear and has a really good sound.

Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.
