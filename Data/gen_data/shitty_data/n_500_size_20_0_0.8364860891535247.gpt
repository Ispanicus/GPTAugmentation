Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I had to read this book to find out where I am supposed to put the tape.  It is an interesting book, and as I read, I realized how much I need to learn about the Bible.

I am not much of a Christian, but I think it is worth reading.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: This is the story of when I met my wife.  I was working as a salesman for a major electronics company.  One day at my boss's office, he asked me if I was married.  I told him I was not.  He said he was going to give me a promotion to manager.  I told him I did not want the job.  He then got his secretary to write on his desk what my title was, and how much money I would make.  When he started a new job, he gave me the title of manager.  I then went to his secretary and told her what my new title was.  She then took my name and address and wrote on his desk, "To Whom It May Concern."  Then she put the letter in his desk.  I was never given the promotion.  We just ended up being good friends.  She was the first woman that I ever knew to be nice to me.  I have been married to my wife for almost 37 years and we have two wonderful kids.

However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time.

However, the CD we received was a complete disaster. The CD was poorly mastered, and the music was all scratchy and bad. The artwork was poor as well. We found the CD to be so disappointing that we contacted Worshipmob to express our dissatisfaction and to let them know that we were not going to buy the CD. When the CD was released, the first week, our friends and family were very excited to hear the CD. Then the following week, they all said that they had gotten the same cd we had and that they were disappointed. We were not going to buy the CD that was released and that we had put so much time and effort into. When it came time to give it to the fans, it was a complete waste of time and money. I have no idea how they could have come up with this CD. All we did was have them send us a disc that they had already used and then had them send us another disc with the same problems. I was so pleased with the Worshipmob that I bought the first CD, "Worship". When I received the second CD, I was very disappointed and did not buy it. I have already given my money to Worshipmob and I will never buy anything from them again. I will pass on their CD's to anyone who asks me about them. I will be writing to Worshipmob and let them know that I have no further use for their CDs.

"California Girls" is a beautiful song.  I love that it's not just a song about girls, but a song about the California girls.  The song is very popular in the Midwest.  It's a very popular song at weddings and other special events.  It's a very good song to dance to, and is a very good song to sing with your friends.

The Beach Boys were one of my favorites.  Some people have called them the first teen pop group.  Their music was very popular and was very well received.

Amazon review:  The Golden Hits - The Beach Boys
The Beach Boys are one of my favorites.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: I've purchased tons of songs off Amazon and have always been happy. I always make sure I click on the right album an look for an Explicit label if there is one. Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples. Well this was the only full version of her retail album, so I listened to the Ur So Gay preview and then purchased it. I put it on my iPod and listened to it and it's censored! This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon review: I have been searching for a vinyl copy of "How To Be A Witch" for a very long time. There is absolutely no way that I could have afforded the original release. I found a bootleg copy of the album on YouTube and bought it. I could not believe the quality of the original recording. I have now purchased the vinyl. I will buy more records when they are released. The album was recorded in a studio not a church with a microphone. The studio was very well done. I am not a "witch" but I would like to see more of these albums coming out.

Amazon review: I think that this is one of the best albums of the year. It is hard to pick just one song, but there are several on this album that I think are great.

I'm not sure if it's the same band from the first two albums, I don't know. I have listened to "All Along The Watchtower" and it is awesome, but I don't think this album is to my taste.

It is very different from the other albums and I can't say that I like it, but it's a good album. It's not a bad album, it just doesn't do it for me.

The first four albums are my favorite, but the last two are also very good. I'm glad that I bought the album. I don't really know what to say about the album

Amazon review: I received the cd-R through the mail.  It is good if you want a cd that is not a dvd.  I was not happy with the package.  The package was very damaged.  It had a hole in the box and there was a hole in the back.  There was also a hole in the front.  I found a used CD case in the trash and put it in the box to put in the cd player.  I had to put the box back in the back of the car and it has since then been in the trash.  There was a broken piece of paper in the front and also a piece of paper in the back.  I found an envelope in the trash that had a piece of paper in it that was torn.  I still have not found out what this paper is but I think it may have been a paper that was used to wrap the cd in.  I believe there was a hole in the box that the package came in.  I am still trying to find out how this happened and I am still unhappy with the package.  The cd player is not working and I have not been able to listen to any of the songs.  I would like to have a refund, but I cannot because I have not received a cd player in return.  I have contacted customer support several times and have been told there is nothing they can do for me because I did not order it.  I have contacted the company to see if they can refund me for the cd player, but I have not received a response.  I am still waiting to get the cd player and see if I can get a refund for it.  I am not happy with this company and would not recommend them to anyone.  I am sorry for the bad experience I had with them.  If I do not get a return in the mail I will take my business elsewhere.  I don't know if they will be as bad or better but you never know.  I only know one company that has good customer support and that is Amazon.  I have heard so many bad things about them and I have never been disappointed.

Dylan is an American treasure, who transcends genres, and does so with the same passion, with which he expressed his love for his country.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, but I don't think it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sounds of the band, I would like to see them do more solos too.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.

Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: The first CD I ever heard of this album was in 1980.  I was a young man looking for a band that I could listen to.  I found the band and I liked them.  But, I was a young man, there was no way a person of my age would listen to a group that was 30 years older than me.  I went on to listen to and buy any number of their albums through my teenage years.  I always enjoyed the band and always considered them to be very talented.  But, to have such a talent and to be so young and have so little chance at a career just didn't appeal to me.  Then came the album I heard the first time, and I was blown away by it.  The group was much better then they were in their first few albums, and this was a true group effort.  I was a fan from the beginning with the first album, and I've been a fan ever since.  But I must admit, to be considered a lover and fan of a group with such a history and such a great following is a little strange sometimes.  I can't help it, I like to think of myself as a fan of an individual band, not just a group.  And if I was to have a group, I'd have a group of my own.  But I can't help it, I like the fact that the album is 30 years old.  I like the fact that the album is on vinyl.  I like the fact that I can play it in my car.  I like the fact that I can listen to it while I make the bed.  I like the fact that I can listen to it while I'm doing the dishes.  I like the fact that I can listen to it in my car.  But, I must admit, to be considered a lover and fan of a group that is considered a legend in their own right is a little strange.

Amazon review: I was recently introduced to the band through a friend of mine who was a big fan of them.  The album I owned was the first album I ever bought from them.  I've been a fan ever since.  But, I must admit, this album is what got me into their music and what made me fall in love with them.  The band was great for a while, but when their success started to come to a halt, so did my interest in them.  I loved them from the start, but I just couldn't get into the same old band.  But, I'm back.  And I don't regret buying this album.  Some people are saying that the band are no longer together.  Well, I say that is a load of BS!  I've been a fan of the band since the beginning, and I'm not going to let anyone tell me that I'm not as a loyal an admirer of the band as I used to be.  I'm back.

Amazon review: This is one of the best albums of all time.  It's a classic and people die when its not on the radio.  I've bought it about every year since it came out in 1986.  I'm a true fan and I love the band more now then I ever did.  The band is so much more than just a band.  They are a family, and that's really all you need.  I love the fact that their first album was released on this label.  I like the fact that their second album was released on this label.  I like the fact that their third album was released on this label.  But more than the fact that their albums were released, what really made this album legendary is the fact that it was released on vinyl.  I love the fact that this album is only available on vinyl.  I love the fact that this album is only available in a single version.  I love the fact that this album is only available on cassette.  I love the fact that this album is only available on CD.  And I love the fact that this album is only available on this label.  I love the fact that this label is only available on cassette.  I love the fact that this label is only available on CD.  And I love the fact that this label is only available on this label.  These are the facts that make this album legendary.

Amazon review: I first heard this album in the early 1980's.  I was a very young man, but the album made me feel like I was sixteen.  The lyrics were very poetic and the music was so beautiful.  I fell in love with the band and spent many, many hours listening to their music.  The album was released on this label.  It's been
