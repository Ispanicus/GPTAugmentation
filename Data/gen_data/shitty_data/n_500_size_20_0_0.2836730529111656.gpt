Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity! If you buy this version, you'll be supporting Glee, who used Coulton's version without any kind of permission or credit. No, thank you!

Amazon review: I've been listening to this song every day since I heard it on the radio in 1999. It has moved through and out of my top 10 on iTunes for years. For many years it's been my favorite song in the world. It is my favorite song ever. I don't even know why it's on my top 10, I didn't even know that was possible. But, it is. So it's my favorite song ever!!

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This compilation of songs from the first four years of Dylan's career was released by Rhino in 2003, and the first thing I noticed when I first listened to this album is that this was a compilation of songs NOT from Dylan's first four years as a singer (and not even his first four years as a recording artist.)  To me, this album is not very different than the previous two Dylan compilations, in that it is, to me, very disappointing.  In fact, I think the two other Dylan compilations are superior to this one, even though this one is a bit longer.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this album. I have a bad habit of listening to Dylan albums on a regular basis (i.e. I listen to them once a week, and each year I have a new Dylan album to listen to while I'm at work, etc.) and this one is one of the best Dylan albums I have heard in a long time.  It's a beautiful album, it's hard to believe it was released in 1981, and it has some of the best songs Dylan has ever written.

Amazon review: I got this one on CD and I think it was worth the money I paid for it.  I bought it for the first time when it came out and I was disappointed when I listened to it.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

A few other tracks to note are "Anchor", which is a powerful song, "Am I Ever Gonna Find Out", which is incredibly catchy, "Take Me Away", another very powerful one, and "The Beginning", which is beautiful enough to make me cry.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review:. the MP3 is of bad quality.  Be wary of downloading Amazon Southern Gospel MP3's.  I have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad LP or something.  Edit: My MP3 skipping problem was traced back to my dial-up connection. Be sure to download Amazon MP3s via broadband for best music quality.

Amazon review: Pearl Jam is the band that basically told MTV to f- off after their FIRST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until their demise How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got huge because of their music & they made even less music videos than Nirvana Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam is truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobain never did FACT: Cobain used to call MTV & tell MTV to play Nirvana's music videos more

Amazon review: The sound quality is great. The only problem is that I need to get this album to work on my laptop.

Amazon review: The music is great and the lyrics are not. The vocals are not as good as those of other bands with the same name. But it has a good sound and the production is amazing. Plus the price is a great deal.

###
Amazon review: I love this band, but I'm not the target audience. This is for a very small group of people that want a real "rocker" sound with a little bit of soul to it. And for the rest of us, this is an excellent and well produced rock album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was my first "real" rock album, and I'm so glad I did. The guitar playing is good, the bass is rock solid, and the drums are killer. Also, the lyrics are more about the real life struggles of the band members than any love songs. So, I'm not going to list this album with songs about love. This is the first album from Pearl Jam that I really enjoy.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I like the sound of this album. I like all the songs except the first one, "Backspacer," which can't stand. The songs are all a little too short, but the album is a great mix of the rock and roll songs with the blues and the ballads.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The Pearl Jam sound is very different, and the album has a really different feel than any other Pearl Jam album I've listened to. It's pretty good for a Pearl Jam album, but probably not as good as the first two Pearl Jam albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: First, I'm not sure what to say about this album. Pearl Jam is one of the best bands this year, and this is not up to their best. It's like listening to three different Pearl Jam albums. If you're only looking for one album, this is it. If you're looking for bands with a certain sound, this is not it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Pearl Jam has been on a downward spiral ever since they lost David. I love this album, but I wish it wasn't the only Pearl Jam album I heard. I like bands that are on the other end of the spectrum from Pearl Jam, but I love this album just as much. It rocks!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the first Pearl Jam album that I've listened to. I love the sound of this album, but the lyrics are not that great. There are some great songs, but there are also some mediocre ones. I was disappointed with this album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a great record, if you're in the mood for a little more pop than what you're used to. The sound is great, and the song's are great, but the lyrics are what really kills this album. It's just not the type of album that I would listen to.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There are some good songs in here, but there are some really bad ones as well. They're all quite short, and that's because of the length of the song. Lyrics are also good, but the vocals are pretty bad. This is a good album that should be listened to, but it's not a Pearl Jam album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a Pearl Jam fan, but I do like this album. I like it for all the right reasons, and I hope it ends up being a good record. I really hope that Pearl Jam doesn't have problems with other record labels. Because it would kill their fans.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've listened to quite a few Pearl Jam albums, and this is by far my favorite. I think it would have been better if they hadn't put in all the cover songs, but I still think it's a great album. I love how they sing in harmony, and it's been a lot of fun to listen to.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is the best album ever.  I'm not a big fan of folk music but this is the exception.  I never would have guessed it.  I hope I can find some other CD's to buy.  I can't believe this album was only 50 cents.

Amazon review: I recently purchased this album.  This is a truly great album.  I will say that I have heard a lot of music on the radio and have never thought to download it.  I am now a fan.  This album and the album that follows it are two of my most favorite albums.  I have listened to all of them twice.  I have listened to them at least four times.  I have tried to play the entire album at least five times.  I have really enjoyed listening to this album and I will probably buy the next album.  I am very impressed with the band and the music.  They are a very unique band.  I think they are one of few bands, which I have heard, which have a unique sound.  I also think that this band is very talented.  I don't want to say too much because I don't want to give away too much about this band.  But I do think it is worth listening to.  I think it is very beautiful.  I think the sound of the music is very unique.  I think I have heard this band in the movies, on TV, on the radio, etc.  I think this band is very original.

I don't know if it is a good album or not, but so far I've liked it and think that it will be better than the first.

I don't know if it is a good album or not but so far I've liked it and think that it will be better then the first. I agree with you about the chorus though, but then again you get used to it after a while.

I don't know if it is a good album or bad, but so far I've liked it and think that it will be a great album, the problem is that it would have been great if it wasn't so expensive, but at the same time I think that it would have been better if it was less expensive, but then again it has its disadvantages, the songs don't really fit together and it isn't very catchy, which is a shame because it is a nice album, the best thing is that there is enough variety, which is very rare in music nowadays so it is a good album in my opinion.

I don't know if it is a good album or a bad album, but so far I've liked it and think that it will be great with a good review, it has a nice mix of styles and can be listened to by anyone.

I don't know if it is a good album or good, but so far I've liked it and think that it will be good and it isn't bad at all, but it has some things that you need to know before listening to it, which you probably won't know until you listen to it, but I think that it will be a great album, as it isn't bad at all, but it is a good album and it has a nice mix of different genres, which is very rare nowadays, so I think that it will be good.

Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

I feel like the artist was trying to do a lot of different things, but nothing was successful.  I was expecting something a little more "rocker" - that is not what I got.  If I had to name a single negative thing about this album, it would be that there were sooooo many songs in the album.  I don't like listening to Keith Sweat.   I just don't.   He is just not my cup of tea.   I just hope he doesn't do another album like this.   He needs to take a break and figure out what he is doing.   He's on the verge of a major career change.   He was on a good note.   The album was solid.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I'm not sure what I was expecting from a Christmas album.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I love the album!  I don't know why, but I thought the songs were actually quite good.  I could really appreciate and get into the songs.  One of the songs I particularly liked was "If I Had Your Love" for the way the vocals were done.  I think the voice quality is really good for a live recording of this quality.  There are other songs that are very good, but not "stand out" from the others.  I know this is a "Christmas album" but it doesn't have any of the typical Christmas songs that I've heard before.  I don't know if there is any Christmas music out there where a song is just a song.  But this album is really good for a "Christmas album".  I would have liked more songs like "O Holy Night" or "Angels We Have Heard on High".  But the songs here are good.

I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.
