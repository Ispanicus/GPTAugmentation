Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Good Music

by: jjmyers

I like this music! I bought this book because I like the cover and the music itself. I love the music and the story very much. I was able to listen to the music on my ipod which was great, but could not transfer it to my smart phone. I was able to listen to it on my ipod on my computer which was a great experience too. I am currently learning how to use an ipod on the computer and I am enjoying it just the same. I like the music on the book too. The music ranges from soft to loud. The book is very interactive. I do not have any problems with the book but I do find it to be a little heavy. It is easy to read the story, but it does take some time. I thought the price of the book was a little high, but it was worth it. I will buy it again and again. It is a great book.

This is a great book for a child in the preschool years who is interested in reading. I would not have guessed that it would be so good for a child who is not interested in reading. It is definitely worth the price of the book.

This is a good book for a preschooler. It is simple, so he/she can comprehend what is read and use it in their daily life. It is also a good way to learn the alphabet while helping your child learn to read. I have it on my ipod and my smart phone, but not on my computer. It is a good story, but I find the illustrations to be a little difficult to follow.

This book is a great way to introduce your child to reading and also helps them learn the alphabet. While it is not required reading, it is a good way to help your child learn if they are not interested in reading yet. It is more helpful if the child reads it from the beginning before beginning to read phonetically. The illustrations are easy to follow and the story is also easy to read.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm one of those people who like to listen to a lot of different types of music, and I don't really think it's wrong to enjoy music that is often classified as "alternative."  However, when it comes to bands like this, I have found that I enjoy the same songs over and over again, in different ways, creating a sort of eclectic playlist of sorts.  There's a reason for this.  I often use this playlist as a sort of "training tape" for my taste in music, and it has saved me from many a bad album.  There are songs that I'll never get tired of, but there are also songs that I will not be able to keep playing in my head for very long, and that is a rare occurrence for me.

Amazon review: I am a devoted fan of the late, great, Pat Travers, who passed away in June of this year.  I have also been a devoted fan of the late, great, John Cale, whose death in January of this year was, and still is, a blow to me.  I am a sucker for an epic, and this album is no exception.  Although I am not a huge fan of the music, the music is solid.  The band has a great sense of humor and a good grasp of melody.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was a little hesitant to get into this band because of all the negative reviews, but I have to say that once I finally sat down and listened to "Savior," I was completely impressed!  Even in a genre which is often dismissed as "old school", this band has managed to create a great mix of progressive, modern and traditional metal.  The band's guitar playing could have been described as "good" by a better guitar player, but it works perfectly with the other members.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Even though I have only had this album for a few weeks, I have already discovered that I love this band!  It is very difficult to pin down exactly why I like this band so much, but I can say with absolute certainty that I like this band's music.  This album is hard to classify, but I would describe it as "rock."  There is a heavy sound to this album, but it does not feel like "heavy metal" in the traditional sense.  It is more akin to a "rock" album, but it has a slightly more "rock" feel to it.  The songs are very catchy and have a nice and catchy vibe to them.  There is a good balance of "good" and "bad" in terms of the lyrics, but again, I am not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have a thing for good sounding albums.  I enjoy listening to good music.  There's not a single aspect of this album that makes me dislike it.

Amazon review: I first discovered this band through a friend who was a huge fan of the great Pat Travers.  This album is a great album.  It is hard to tell the exact genre of this album because it blends so many different styles of music together.  There are a few songs about heavy metal, but the majority of the songs are all about love.  I like this band because they are able to write catchy songs and they are able to write songs about love, which is something that I enjoy.  They are also able to write songs about life, and I like this.  They are able to write songs about life that are deep and moving, something I enjoy.  This album is perfect for the person who likes great music and great lyrics.

Amazon review: I agree, it's quite repetitive. It's just so bad, I can't believe someone would try to sell this for $20. You can't even tell what song is playing, it's just a repetitive beat that goes on and on and on. I was just about to buy this, then I saw the title of this review, and I realized what they were trying to do, and I couldn't believe it.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.

Amazon review: I've been listening to "Sway" by Bruno Mars and "I Feel It Coming" by Marlena Shaw for a while now.  They're both great songs but I never had such a good ear for Marlena's and Bruno's voices.  "I Feel It Coming" by Marlena Shaw is one of my favorite songs of the year so far.  It's so melodic and has such a nice flow to it. I like Bruno's voice and melody.  I also like the way the song flows and the way that the lyrics work together.  But I think I'll just stick to listening to the Marlena Shaw song.  I'll be back.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I just can't get enough of Marlena Shaw.  It's such a shame that I can never hear her songs.  And "I Feel It Coming" is one of my favorites.  Here's another one of my favorite tracks from Bruno Mars.  This one is called "Finesse".  I like it.  It's a nice little beat-to-beat song.  So check it out next time you're in the mood for some cool R&B.  I'm sure you'll like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked the song "Cake by the Ocean".  It was a nice song but I thought Bruno's voice sounded so fake on it.  It sounded like he was reading from a script.  I'm sure it's his voice but it was a little fake.  The song's not bad.  It's a nice song.  But he's not the best singer.  I like the Marlena Shaw song better.  It's a little more up-tempo and her voice is a little more pleasant.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really liked Marlena Shaw's song "I Feel It Coming".  It was very melodic and cool.  I like the beat and the way the lyrics come together.  Although it's not a Bruno Mars song it's a great song.  I like the way it flows.  It's a nice little beat-to-beat song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Finesse" is another one of Bruno's songs. It's not a classic (that's for sure) but it's a good song.  There's a lot of Marlena Shaw influences in it.  It's a cool song that makes me happy.  Bruno's voice is OK.  It's not great but it's not awful either.  I like it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Marlena Shaw is a very talented girl.  She's not the best singer but she has a very good voice.  The song "I Feel It Coming" by Marlena Shaw has a very cool beat to it.  The lyrics are very nice.  So check it out.  I'm sure you will like it.

###
Amazon review: I really liked the song "Come On".  It was very beautiful and had a nice beat.  I like that Bruno is singing in English.  I like the melody of the song.  It's a nice little beat-to-beat song. It's a bit slower than the rest of Bruno's songs so it won't take long to get used to.  It's not a classic but it's a good song that you will enjoy.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm sure you will love Marlena Shaw's song "I Feel It Coming".  It's a nice song with a nice verse and a nice chorus.  It's not great but it's not terrible either.  It's not a classic but it's a nice song. You have to give it a try.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: The song "Unhappy Birthday" by The Dixie Chicks is not played on radio stations and so I don't understand why it was on the album.  I don't want to be a bitter old man, but I don't understand why we are listening to these recordings of people's children singing that song.  I don't know if it's an oldie or just plain bad taste.  I think it was on the album because it can be heard in the video.  I will not purchase this CD but I will buy another one if they actually play the song in the video.  I do not consider that a good purchase.  I think the song is a good, decent song, but I am not going to make a huge deal about it.  I am just saying that this album does not inspire me to purchase it.  Not sure what other people think.  I have yet to listen to "Hurt."  I don't really care for it.  I think it's a bad song by a bad band.

Amazon review: "No Man's Land" -  I have a feeling this song was put on the album because it sounds to me like one of those songs that are supposed to be on the compilation but they never made it.  I don't want to be a cynic, but I don't understand why this song got on the album.  I'm a fan of the band and I like the music they make; that's why I like this album.

Amazon review: I was so excited to start listening to this album.  I had been looking forward to it for months.  I am a fan of their music and am very glad that I have gotten this CD.  I like the first 4 songs.  But I just don't like this album.  It just doesn't have the quality that I was expecting.  I also don't have high hopes for this CD.  I don't like the lyrics or the music.  I don't like it because I don't think it's worth the money.  I also don't like the band or the album, so...I just don't feel like I can rate this one.  I wish it was better.  I really don't know why they put songs like "Undertow" and "The Other Side" on this CD.  I don't like them, I don't listen to them, and I don't want to be a fan of one of the biggest bands in the world.  I am now trying to find a song on this CD that I do like, because I really do like the band.  I just don't like this CD.  I don't think it's worth the money.  I don't want to be a fan of them or of this CD.  I don't think I will ever buy this CD.  I am just going to keep it.  I just hope that when I finish listening to it that I will be able to find one song that I do like.  I would rate this album a 5.  I think it's worth the money.  I like the music on this CD.  I just don't like it.  I think it's worth the money.  I just don;t think it's worth $15.00.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album starts out with a few tracks of the "I Don't Mean Nothing" type, but the song that really stands out is "Paid in Full" with its powerful bass line and powerful drumming (this is the only song in the album that I thought sounded like it was recorded with a drum machine).  The song has great guitar work, and the vocals are by far the best part of the entire album.  The song is about people who think they can get away with murder and is reminiscent of the old school hardcore like I don't mean nothing by the great bands like Negative Trend, Black Ice, and Dope.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: When I read the back cover description, I was expecting a good quality rock album, not a bad sounding one.  It was a disappointing purchase.  This album is the complete opposite of what I was expecting to hear.  The songs don't grab me and the lyrics are inane.  The production is amateur at best and the vocals sound like they were recorded with a microphone.  The music is extremely generic.  This is a very unlistenable "rock" album.

I purchased it to show my friends and family what the song was all about.

Amazon review: If you like any rap in the last decade or so, then this album is good for you.  If you are not into rap then it's not for you.

The lyrics are average to good, the production is average to good, and the music is average to good.  The only good thing that is good is the album jacket. The title of this album is called "The Black Album" and the album cover is black and white.  It's cool and makes you like the album.   But then again, the album is not very good.  Some albums are good and some are not.

###
Amazon review: If you have an open mind and are easily offended, then this album is for you.  This is an album that is good for the most part and only has one song that is a let down.  It's a really bad rap album that's just a mediocre album for rap fans.  It's a horrible album.  It's no different from any other rap album.  It's just that this one has an "Om" in the album title.  This is not a bad album, it's just a terrible album.  Some of the lyrics make no sense and some of the songs are horrible.  Even the song with the best music is just awful.  The only good thing is that the album jacket is cool.  The album cover is black and white and is cool.  It's just another mediocre rap album.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love the original video recording, but this version adds way to much instrument background music.  Makes it difficult to hear the words at many points in the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Destroyer" starts off with a lot of potential, but after a few minutes, the song just becomes annoying.  The vocals need work.  The guitar on this song is the worst I've heard from this band in a long time.  It's really, really difficult to listen to.  The chorus is weak and not that melodic.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is very hard to listen to.  The guitar solo is a highlight, but then it just gets to the point where it's just getting to the point where it's just getting to the point where it's getting to the point where it's just getting to the point where it gets annoying.  I don't know if I'm just overanalyzing, but I don't know.  I like the song, but I don't like it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The lyrics remind me of the lyrics of "The Last" from the "Hangover" movie.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The vocals are not as bad as the vocals of "Dance of Death."  I was disappointed with the vocals on this song, but I suppose it's hard to compare.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It seems like a lot of people don't know how good "Lethal Weapon" was.  It's one of the best action films of all time.  It always has a huge following.  The movie is also very hard to listen to.  The vocals are not as bad as the vocals on this bad song.  The guitar solos are great, but the song itself is very annoying.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The lyrics are about how things went wrong in the past, while the music is about how things went right.  It's an odd combination, but I get it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song is about a woman who is being treated badly by her husband.  She finds out that he's been cheating on her, and he says, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."  She tells him, "No, you didn't."  The music is about how she loves him, and how he says he's sorry, and how she says, "No, you didn't."  He tells her, "You're right."  The lyrics are about how he really loves her, and she tells him, "I know."  The music is about how she really loves him, and he says, "I know."  All of it is about how she really loves him.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song starts off with a great guitar riff.  The music is great, but the vocals are terrible.  They're so bad that they actually become unbearable.  It's just one of those songs that sounds like the song is about it.  I know that sounds like I'm saying, "This song sounds like it's about the song," but it's not.  This song is about a guy who's in love with his girlfriend.  He's so in love with his girlfriend that he's willing to do anything to make her happy.  He starts going to jail for stealing, and he realizes that he's being treated unfairly.  He's finally free, and he's happy.  He tells her, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The lyrics are really good.  It's one of the best songs of 2013.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The lyrics describe a man who's a really good listener.  He's very good at listening to music, and he can tell when a song is good.  He has a way of just listening to music.  He's constantly in love with his wife, and he can tell if she's happy.  He doesn't want to hurt her, and he realizes that the song is good.  He says, "You're right."  He never lies to her.  He really loves her.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song describes a guy who has a really good job.  He's a really good salesman.  He's very good at selling products.  The music is about his success, and he tells his girlfriend, "I know."  The lyrics are about how great he is at his job.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The lyrics are about how we all should help each other.  It's one of those songs that you can sing along to, and it's also one of those songs that you can dance to.  Its got a good beat, a great chorus and a great feel
