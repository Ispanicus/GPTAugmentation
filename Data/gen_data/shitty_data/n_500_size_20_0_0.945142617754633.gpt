Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Josh's since I first heard his song "Love of My Life" on a compilation.  I was excited that his new album would be like a new Josh Wilson, that I was waiting for, and I was very happy with the way that it turned out.  He sings in a very personal way, and he has a wonderful voice.  I love the way that he sings "The Greatest Love Of ALL," and I love the way that he sings it.  This is a great album, and I like it.

Amazon review: I am not thrilled with Brandon's solo effort. I find it boring.  I find myself skipping MOST of the tracks and there are only 2 or 3 likable songs out of 14.  That is not what I wanted. I wanted 6-8 tracks that were VERY good not just 2-3.  Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.  I have listend to this album 6 or 7 times and still am not too thrilled.

Amazon review: I was excited when I found this album. After listening to it, I find it to be better than the Killers.

Amazon review: Wow, this is the first ever album I have ever purchased and listened to.  The only reason I bought it was because it was the most expensive on that page.  I love the songs on this album and the album is fantastic in my opinion.  I do have one problem with this album, it has a lot of songs that do not really sound like the Killers.  I don't even know what it is, but I do know they are not Killers songs.  One song has the lyrics in the wrong order, another song has some different lyrics.  I don't know what the problem is, but I have listened to this album a few times and I am not going back.  I think if you don't like the Killers songs this is a good album, but I don't know if I can continue to listen to it after that.  It is a little weird that I am not sure what the difference is but I am going to stick with it.

They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: This album is the epitome of a "sound" album on the level of a "sound" album.  It's really awesome.  I'm not impressed with the lyrics, because it becomes so repetitive, but I do appreciate how the songs were arranged to make the best use of each instrument and the best arrangement for the song.  I also appreciate how they didn't try to be too many different songs, but just one song per song, that would have made the album boring.  The music is well-written, the lyrics are okay, and the arrangements are very well-done.  I will purchase this album, but not as a soundtrack to a movie, because I don't like movies.  I will however, purchase this album as a soundtrack to my library since it will be a soundtrack to my life.  This is one of those albums that will be played repeatedly over and over, as I listen to it over and over, and then, I am like, "Okay, I'll play it again, but this time, I am going to play it with my music."  I love the music, but I don't like the lyrics, so I will probably pass on this album.  But, you can't deny the fact that this album rocks!  If you want a great soundtrack, go to the store and get this, I think you'll be happy with it.

Amazon review: As far as I'm concerned, this is my favorite Three Days Grace album.  It's a great mix of "songs" (and maybe a little too much of a mix of songs) that have a great groove to them, plus some really great melodies and harmonies throughout that I enjoy.  I think I've got the CD of this CD in my CD collection now.  So far, not one of the tracks has been a let-down for me, and I'm almost positive that the songs will continue to play over and over again.  I love the songs on this CD, and I hope to listen to it over and over again.  Three Days Grace is an awesome band, and I hope to have them as part of my life for a long time to come.

I really, really like this album, but I don't really like it because it's so boring, and I don't like having to go back and listen to the same words all the time.  The music is good, but I wish the lyrics were better.  A couple of songs I really like, but most of the songs don't catch my attention.  I probably wouldn't buy this album, unless I really liked it, but I don't really like Three Days Grace's music, so I'll just leave this album in my collection.

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

My Favorite Dylan Albums

I have a nice stash of Dylan albums. Here are my 5 favorite Dylan albums on CD, including The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-6.

5. Love and Theft (1957-1958)

I listened to all of the Dylan albums a long time ago and never got around to Love and Theft. Love and Theft is an incredible album that is filled with great songs.

4. Highway 61 Revisited (1969-1972)

I thought Highway 61 Revisited was one of Dylan's best albums. It is the definitive Dylan album in my opinion. It is filled with great songs.

3. Live at the Fillmore East (1965)

Live at the Fillmore East is Dylan's greatest concert film. I have seen it many times and it is incredible. It is filled with great songs.

2. Chronicles: Bob Dylan (1976-1979)

This is the Dylan album I have not heard, but I have seen it many times. I have seen it just about every year since the show was over. It is great.

And Finally, I would recommend:

1. Highway 61 Revisited (1969-1972)

This is my favorite Dylan album.

If you have not listened to any of these albums, I would suggest you get them now. You will not regret it.

If you have listened to any of these albums, I would suggest you listen to at least one more album to see what you think of them.

It is better you see what you think of

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there.

In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I can't understand why Amazon wants a review for music. Most people wouldn't buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it. I do.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: It's odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it. It was just some breathing noise and what I assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy. I replied to the seller but for some reason I received a legal notice saying that I was being charged for hurt feelings. Would not reccomend

Amazon review: I've had this song for years. But I think I have a special connection with it. It is a song I really love, the music is great and the lyrics are great. I get chills when I hear it. It was a gift from my Grandma. I don't like this song at all. I didn't have a problem with this song one time, I had a problem with another song I listened to. This song is awful. It makes me angry and I don't know why it bothers me. It's nothing personal.

I really like this song and have always liked Tanya Tucker. I am sure that the sound quality was very good.

Amazon review: I think this is one of Tanya Tucker's best songs. I think this is one of the only songs Tanya Tucker ever recorded for which she sings all the verses on the same note. The other songs she sung the verses on different notes, except for this song, which she sang all the verses on the first note. I think the song is very catchy. I love it.

Amazon review: I have listened to this song a couple of times now and love it very much. I have my sister around the house and she is quite a singer. She usually sings when I am not around to hear what she has to sing. I would never have known that she was a singer if I didn't have the CD.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I use this at the moment, and have been using it for about 14 years. It is by far the best of the many relaxation methods I have tried. I would say that it is the best of all methods I have tried. It is easy to use and in a few minutes I have my peace of mind.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: Indie artist Jonathan Coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song Baby Got Back. His version is amazing. If you buy his version through February, proceeds go to charity!

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

This is a good purchase, but if you are a fan of the album White Album then you might want to wait for the second disc, "White Album II". If you are a fan, get the White Album. If you are not a fan, get the White Album. This is not a bad album. The songs are good. The spoken word is good. The production quality is good. The lyrics are good.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: This is a great CD. I am a big fan of Mr. Hamer. The songs are all very different, but all very interesting. This is one of the better Hamer albums that I have heard.

Amazon review: When I first got this CD I loved it and got it home and listened to it over and over. I thought it was great and could not get it out of my head so I just kept on listening to it and bought it. I listened to it every day for months. I am still listening to it everyday and I have not had a chance to listen to it yet. I have listened to it two more times and have not heard an improvement.

Amazon review: This is an exciting, exciting, exciting collection of new and mostly overlooked music from a man who still has the magic touch.

Amazon review: So far I have been on a high and happy listening to this CD. Its not so much a new CD, its more of a re-issue of the same songs re-arranged in a different way, but it is a CD that is well worth taking a listen to.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band since I was a little girl and this is still one of my favorite CDs.  The most recent songs are just as great as the original, with a lot more energy and emotion.  This is one of the best albums I have heard of this genre.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is the best CD I have ever heard.  I first heard this album on my car radio, and it changed my life... It's the song "Do You, Do You, Do You" that stuck with me through the entire ordeal.  I have lost count of the number of times I have been on a bus, subway, plane, or on the phone and have heard "Do You, Do You, Do You," and been transported back to my teenage years.  It brought tears to my eyes and made me realize that I wasn't alone, and that there are millions of other people who have been through the same thing as me.

Amazon review: I love this album.  It's one of my favorites.  The songs are so good that it was hard to choose just one.  I'm going to give it a hard choice between one of the new songs and one of the old ones.  As I said before, I like the old ones least.  But the new ones... WOW!  The new songs are all great.  This is easily the best CD I have heard this year.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This is truly a great collection of music, and a good one at that.  This CD is what I call the "A-OK" CD, meaning that the songs are great, but the band in terms of singing and playing isn't the best.  It's a good CD though.
Sentiment: Positive

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  I think this album is great, but I have a hard time taking it seriously. The guitar playing is not up to par and the lyrics are repetitive.  It is a shame that no one has told Corey about the band's music.  I have listened to this album over and over and can't get past it.

Amazon review:  I am a bit confused.  I do not know how to rate this.  I will give it a 4.5.  I like it, but it is not a favorite.  I feel like a lot of their albums have been on the radio for so long and it is getting old for them to be playing songs that they have been around for so long.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  I really like this album.  I can't get past the fact that it is very boring.  It is the same kind of music that I listen to on the radio all day.  I thought there was a lot of energy and personality behind this album but it ends up being a boring album.

Amazon review:  This was my first Slipknot album.  I got it for nothing at all from Amazon.  I will buy it again from CD baby but I won't be buying the next one from them.  This is just typical Slipknot.  I like the band and I like their albums but they are boring.  I wish they would go out on tour again.  I like the band but they could do a lot better.
