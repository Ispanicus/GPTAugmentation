Amazon review: Never heard of the Hand Pan until I watched some videos on YouTube.  Loved the sound of the instrument and thought I would give it a try to help me sleep.  Had one of the best sleeps in a long time.  Maybe it was a one off, but this was encouraging.  Time will tell.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2. The small sample DVD only contains about 4 minutes of video footage from Creepers Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. If you want the full DVD contact Cali's finest productions. You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

Amazon review: I had my doubts with buying this DVD. I was ready for a new and improved version of the Cali lifestyle, but instead I purchased this "new and improved" version of Cali lifestyle. A great cd, that has no content but its music, not only has no content, it is not even good cd's as the cd cover is very generic and unoriginal. Also, the audio quality is not that good. The music is nice, but the quality is poor. I'm not sure if it's just the digital download, but maybe someone can explain this to me. I'll keep my money on the CD, the Cali lifestyle. I'm not sure I needed the audio CD. It sounds great on the CD, but on the audio cd it sounds terrible.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review:  The "I don't give a F**k" song that has been on the radio for over a year.  So it's like, "Hey, I've been trying to get the radio station to play this song for years, but they won't do it.  What do you want me to do?"  I hate to be a Debbie downer (or a Debbie downer), but I don't think it's going to help the kids at the school I work at.  I'm sorry, but I just don't know how to get them through this horrible period.  They are just going to go right back to where they were before the song.  I really hate to say this, but I think this song is a total waste of time.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This was my first choice for Lenny Kravitz's next single.  The song starts out with the usual acoustic guitar notes and then a guitar riff comes in and then it goes back to the acoustic guitar.  This is a nice song and it plays better in the original recording than the remastered version I received.  I think the main reason why I gave it five stars is because of the song's unique hook.  I enjoyed it and thought it would play better live.  This may not be the case.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Not as good as the first one, but still a good song.  I love the song, but I think the vocals are a little too high.  I would prefer if Lenny would sing in a lower voice.  The song is catchy though. The guitar playing is amazing.

###
Amazon review: This song is a good choice for Lenny Kravitz.  I think it was written with the idea of a slow, soft and romantic song.  This song has a great beat, great guitar, great guitar solo and Lenny's vocals are wonderful.  This song is good as a single and I think it would be even better as a video.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a pretty good song, but I wish Lenny would do a bit less strumming (the guitar's chords are usually in a minor key).  Maybe he could play the song in a different key. It's not that it was bad, it's just that it was a little boring.  He could have played the song in a different key and made it a little different.  I would have loved to hear him do a cover of the James Brown song "Say It Ain't So."  This song is pretty good, I think it would even be better live. But, I think Lenny Kravitz is a nice guy, so I'd take him on any tour.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really like this song.  Lenny does an excellent job at writing his own music.  The song is good and catchy, and the guitar playing is really good.

The songs are so beautiful and the songs are so great that they make the album.  I am in love with this album.  But I have to say that I am a little disappointed with the song structure.  I thought that it was better at the beginning.  It was a little hard to listen to at the beginning.  I'm going to have to listen to it again to be sure.  The other songs are great.  The other songs that I have listened to and liked were "The Way It Is" and "You're Not You" and "In Love With a Feeling" and "Love of My Life".  "You're Not You" is a song that is so beautiful and has a very special melody that keeps the feeling of the song and the whole album.

The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: The band definitely has a lot of potential. There are times where they sound like they are trying very hard to make a song sound cool rather than just the other way around.

I don't know why people complain about it.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: I'm a fan of most of the bands that have played with this band.  This is easily one of their most solid albums.  They sound great, but I'll give it to them for the fact that they did it.  The song "Collide" is their best song.  I like the songs "Heartache" and "The Last Time" the best.  The song "Collide" is really good.  Its a very catchy song.  I like the way they play it.  The songs have a good tempo.  They have one of the best voices I've heard.

Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree.

But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Most of the songs are very similar to each other, which is a little disappointing considering the fact that they are all good songs. I'm not sure how I felt about the lyrics.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.
