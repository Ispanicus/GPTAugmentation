Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

#1. Dope Beats Vol. 1 (DJ Premier/Krondon) - $14.95 -
Amazon review: Dope Beats Vol. 1 is a collection of original beats and remixes by DJ Premier. This is the first release in the Dope Beats series, and is a nice introduction to the series to new DJs and producers. The beats themselves are well crafted and have a nice sound to them. The vocals are not the best, but are still very good. The beats are a little on the boring side, but overall a good introduction to the Dope Beats series.
#2. Heat Beats Vol. 1 - (Royalty Free) - $14.95 -
Amazon review: Heat Beats Vol. 1 is a collection of original beats and remixes by Royalty Free. The beats are a little dull and not as energetic as the Dope Beats series, but at the same time there's a good amount of variety in the beats. The vocals are definitely the best on the beats here

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

Amazon review: This skips too many lines.  She reads lines 1-7 then skips 8-12. Reads 13-30, then skips 31-38. Reads 39-42 SKIPS AGAIN 43-66! At first I didn't know what was going on. Disappointed and not worth the money.

If you want to know the truth about a particular religious leader, go to the library and look in the books about that person. They are there, you can see them in hard copy, if you look hard enough.

By the way, the book I linked is free, available on the internet for anyone who wants to read it, and for free.

I think your post is very interesting, although the people you talk about sound like they have a lot of work to do. I think your post is very positive and I think that's why you posted it.

I've actually read some of the books mentioned by you, and I agree with you that they are not very good.

I'm surprised at you because the "pre-teen" is very much a part of the church, and I'm not really sure what you mean by "pre-teen target audience."

I would say the church has to be prepared for that. It's easy to go to church, if you've been there for a long time, but it

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I know when I first started listening to her music, I thought, "This is great....this is it". I was really happy and amazed when I found out that she is an incredible singer. I started listening to her and after listening to the songs, I realized that her voice is not that great. I was really disappointed and frustrated.  It wasn't until she started singing "I'm sorry" in her "I'm Sorry" video though, that I realized that she was actually a great singer.  I like her music a lot and if I had to choose, I would go for BOC.

Amazon review: I really enjoy this album, and I've decided that I'm going to buy it when it's released (in May). I didn't know how much I'd like this album at first, but I've never been a fan of country music.  I am glad to see that Kelly Price is releasing a re-release of this album, and I'm glad to see that this album has been a part of the Country Music Hall of Fame for a number of years.  I enjoyed listening to Kelly's songs growing up, but I wasn't a fan of hers, although I'm a fan of her music now.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: There's something about this album that has me wanting to buy it.  The songs are great, the sound is great, and she is definitely talented.  Kelly Price seems to have a passion for singing, and I'm glad to see that she is now releasing this album that was originally intended for a Broadway album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I first heard the music of Kelly Price from her first album "The Songbirds", and from her first album "The Songbirds" I was blown away by her voice and singing style.  I have always been a fan of Kelly, and after hearing her first album, I wanted to see if "The Songbirds" would be any different.  I am so happy that I did.  As I was listening to this new album, I found that Kelly Price is a great singer.  The songs are very well written, and the lyrics are a plus.  The songs are very different from the first album, but it is very refreshing to hear a different style.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have never liked Kelly Price.  Her voice is not like most voices that I have heard in country music, and I'm not sure why.  However, I do like her songs and I'm glad that she's back.  It is a welcome surprise after the disappointment of hearing her first album.  I hope that she will put out another great album.  I love Kelly Price, I have been a fan of hers for years, but I'm glad that she's finally going to release new music.  I love Kelly Price, and I hope that she'll continue to sing.

Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I bought the CD in hopes that Kelly Price would release a new album.  I was hoping that it would be another album with her doing some different songs, but after listening to her new album, I'm glad to say that Kelly Price is back in country music.  I love Kelly Price, and I hope that she will continue to sing.

Amazon review:"The songbirds" is a lot more like country than her first album.  I like the songs that she does with her band.  I like the songs that she does with her band that we don't get to hear in the video, and I like the songs that she does with her band in the other videos.  I will say that I am disappointed that she would sing "I'm sorry" in the video.  I just think that it is a bad choice to have Kelly Price singing a song in a video.  It's not like she is singing an a cappella song

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co-writing his songs and I'm sure this one is no exception.  However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time. The lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesn't explore like you'd want it to.  Sorry, Lenny. Maybe next time!  2 stars.

Amazon review: So much of the rap music out these days is based on a theme.  I don't get it.  I'm not saying that all rap has to be based on a single theme but what I'm saying is that it's got to be consistent.  It's got to have a common thread or motif.  The theme here is "Rapper with a gun."  There's no theme.  And that's what's lacking on this CD.  The songs are all good.  But they're not consistent.  The second song, "The Ghetto" is really good.  The last song, "I Can't Go" is decent.  I don't know about the others but they are good.  I can't say that the album is a total flop.  But it's definitely a flop that should have been the first CD.  I can only hope that "Numb" is the last.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The album is a major disappointment.  The music is pretty good but they should have focused on the more upbeat songs like "The Ghetto" and "I Can't Go."  In fact, it would have been nice to have them play "The Ghetto" at the end of the album.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If I were to describe this album in one word it would be "mediocre."  This is a band with a lot of talent and good ideas.  But for some reason they seem to forget that sometimes music isn't just about talent.  If anything they should be grateful that they are getting in the studio more than they have in the past.

Amazon review: If you are expecting an epic rock album with amazing production and a full on rock band with amazing musicianship and musicianship you would be sadly mistaken.  This album is just a bunch of songs that sound like they were written by a five year old with a keyboard.  The songs sound like they were recorded in a garage and the band did not know what they were doing.  It's a total mess.  I can't believe I am giving this album 4 stars.  The songs are just so bland and boring that the album just gets boring.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: This is the first Pink Floyd album I have ever heard, and it was a disappointment. I feel like this is an album that will never be considered "great" because it seems to me that there is far too much noise for it to be considered anything truly great. The first side is a little better, with some great songs like "The Wall" and "The Pale King". I also love the song "The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill" which is a great rock song that still manages to touch my heart. Still, I am disappointed that this album is not considered "great" by most people, but I guess that is what makes it so amazing. It is still a good album by me, and I do recommend it to others, but most people will probably not listen to it, or will listen and not enjoy it, which is the best way to be.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I also like how the female voice seems to take the melody and change it up. I love how the female voice goes from singing to singing again. I love how the male voice doesn't add any additional words, I like how the female voice adds on words to the song like they're coming out of her mouth.

Amazon review: I was really disappointed with this album.  I think if you are looking for a good TSO album, this is not the album for you.  It is not a bad album, but it is not a good album either.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Beautiful collection of songs from "The Heart of the Matter" to "The Golden Gate".  I feel like you can hear the evolution of this band.  This is a band that will stay together forever and never have to record another album.  The music is a constant reminder of why I love music, it is a constant source of inspiration.

With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust, I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients. Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: His vocals are too modern country. The songs are depressing and mundane. They are all too similar. It just goes on for too long.

Amazon review:  This one is really well made.  You can tell that the producer really cares about the songs and worked hard to make them as good as they are.  The songs here, are not "singer-written".  I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is a real song.  It is a real song.  The sound quality is very good.  The vocals are clear.  The vocals are actually good and this is not just a generic country song.  It is a great pop song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: The other reviewer found this a "lame" song.  I am not a fan of the pop style of country music.  However, I do like the lyrics and the message.  I appreciate the fact that this is a song about a man who was a real man.  I like the fact that the singer actually takes the time to talk about his life and his life's problems.  I like the fact that the song is about a man who is a father, and that he has a family.  I like the fact that the song is about a man who has a good sense of humor and that he makes jokes.  All in all, I appreciate the fact that the lyrics are pretty good.

Amazon review: This song isn't really a country song.  I don't really enjoy listening to country songs, so this one really turned me off.

Amazon review: I don't know why it is so hard to find a good country song with a good message.  The majority of the time country songs just say the same thing over and over again.  I am really disappointed in the fact that the song is just the lyrics over and over again.  The fact that most of the lyrics are repeated over and over again does not make the song any better.  I wish the singer would have written a couple of little original lyrics that are actually interesting and would have had a good message.  I have found that the average country singer just repeats the same lyrics over and over again.  The lyrics here are not as good as a good country song.  I don't enjoy listening to country songs, but this one was really bad.

Amazon review: This song is a good song, but not great.  I like the song and I like the message. The only problem I have with this song is the fact that I have a hard time understanding what the singer is saying sometimes.  When he sings a word, it sounds like that word is being repeated a lot.  It seems as if the singer is speaking a lot but it is not his words that are being repeated over and over again.  It is his voice.  He is not saying "I am tired of being drunk and I am tired of being drunk" over and over again.  He is saying "I am tired of being drunk, I am sick and tired of being drunk" maybe three times.  I get the point that he is tired of being drunk but is it really necessary to repeat that over and over again?  I am not a country fan, but I enjoy a lot of other music.  This song is not that music.

Amazon review: The song itself is good.  It is a catchy song with a catchy message.  It is a good song.  But the chorus is so boring I couldn't care less.  It is not the chorus that is boring, it is the same lyrics over and over again.  "I'll never be like you. I'll never be like you."  You could have at least sung that 3 times.  I am not a fan of the pop style of country music, but I do like this song, and the message.  It is too long and a little too repetitive, but the message is good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The song is a little over three minutes long.  You can tell the song is good because it has good harmony vocals.  I have to say the song is good.  The song is good.  The song
