Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

This album has been a keeper for me for a while. I’ve listened to it at least a couple of times per week for almost a year now. I bought almost all of it and this was the last batch of songs that I purchased. I’m going to listen to them over and over again.

I love the album. Very positive, energetic and uplifting. I like to think of the album as a party song and a party is the goal here. The music is very fun and the vibe is great. It’s great to hear an album that doesn’t go down the path of heavy metal or hard rock. It’s just a joy to listen to.

The first half is really inspiring. The second half is more of a party and at that point the album just gets into your head and you start to get into the groove. There is a lot of variety in the songs. There is a lot of great music. This is well worth the money.

I really enjoy this album. This is a great album to listen to if you want to work on your vocals and find out what works for you. If you want to play this album in a club it is a great one to play. I love the song “Shake It” because it is the only song that is a jam. It’s a great sing-a-long type song. The album is a good listen all around, and it’s a great song to start your day with.

So many songs and so many great songs. I love the first half and then it gets in your head and you start to get into the groove. I can’t wait to listen to the second half and then I’ll be ready to party because that’s what this album is really all about.

This is a very good album. I don’t think you can go wrong with this album. It’s a great album with a great message.

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: I've had this CD for a few months now and it's a very good CD to have.  The sound is very clear and crisp.  It is not too thick or noisy either.  It is easy to listen to.  It has good production.  It also has a lot of songs that I like....  And..... it has a lot of songs that I didn't know existed.  It's a very versatile CD, and it's a very good CD.  The only drawback is that I have the same problems with the label.  I think the label should be very, very careful.  I think they've made some very poor decisions.  I think they should be very careful.  I think they should think about the quality of the songs.  I think you have to be careful when you are buying a CD because you could be buying something that's not right.  I have bought a few and have had to return some.  I think they're really, really, really, really, really, really bad....  They're not good.  They're not good at all.  They're not good.  I think they should be very, very careful.  There are a lot of bad decisions.  I think they're really, really, really, really, very bad choices.  I think they should make, make, make, make, make, make sure they have music that's very, very, very, very, very, very good.  I think they're really, really, really, really, bad.  I think they should be very, very, very careful.  I think they should be very, very, very, very, very careful.  I think they should be very careful.  I think they need to be very, very, very, very careful.  I think they should just be very, very, very, careful.  They need to be very, very, very, careful.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: Prince was born in Detroit on October 28, 1953. He is the youngest son of Sylvia and Prince Rogers Nelson, a civil rights attorney. He is the first black child of a white mother. Prince grew up on a Detroit street and was raised by his white grandmother. He first discovered music at an early age, and was a drummer, then a guitarist, before discovering his musical talent as a singer. His family moved to Minneapolis when he was about 13, then to New York City, and finally to Los Angeles, CA, where he has lived ever since.
His first recording session was in 1973. He released six singles and two 7" records during his early years, and recorded over 75 albums. He was named one of the "30 most influential people in music" by Time magazine and on the list for Rolling Stone magazine. In 1990, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 1993 he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Prince's first album, around

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

I finally settled on this one because it sounded very similar.  I love this CD.  It is by far the best CD purchase I have made in a very long time!  I will never forget the first time I heard "I Believe in a Thing Called Love". You are amazing!

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: First off, I had no idea who the rapper was until after I read the text. Secondly, I have to say that the lyrics are not particularly offensive. I don't think it was actually meant to be offensive, but I do think that you could probably use a little more sensitivity in your delivery.

Amazon review: The problem here is that I don't know who the artist is. I was trying to find out for a long time, and in the end I decided to look for it on Amazon. I found out that it is a band called "L.A.S.A." that was formed in New York City in the late 90's. I don't know if I should be disappointed or excited at the fact that I found out about their existence, but I am disappointed nonetheless. The music is boring and the lyrics are pretty lame. I don't know what to think, but I was hoping for a good album, but I guess it is not what I was hoping.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like it. I think its a good song. I really like the song. Its kinda catchy and i like the lyrics. I would listen to anything by it.

Amazon review: I heard this record in a radio show with the lyrics of "I don't love you, I'm just plain jealous" and I thought it was great, so I ordered it from Amazon. It is by a new band called "Chunk," which is a very new band that has not yet done a single, but it is definitely worth checking out. If you want a true punk anthem, this is it, with lyrics that are totally true. The song is called "I'm a Punk" and its a great song.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.

However, unlike many singles off of Lenny Kravitz albums, this song isn't very magical. In fact, it falls flat on the floor.  The guitar in the beginning is OK but then it fades for a long time.

Amazon review: Every now and then, great artists miss the target. Queen had "Hot Space" Van Halen had VH III this is on that scale of bad. It's sing songy long boring choral moments. It's melodramatic story telling. It is the greatest collection of technically gifted artists playing simple uninteresting parts. Do you remember Asia? Yeah it's that bad.

Sentiment:-

I'm impressed with this album, it has a lot of good songs in it. It took me about 4 hours to get through it. It is definitely worth buying. The album I've listened to, I will have to listen to it again. I have also heard the live version of the song "Loud" and it reminds me of Queen. It is another great album. I would recommend it for all ages. I would like to do a review on the album myself. There are a couple people who have done reviews of the album already. Check
