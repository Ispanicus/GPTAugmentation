Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I'd love to give this a great review  ( because I've been purchasing MP3 downloads for YEARS from Amazon). But after all my searching, my hard drive shows no sign of this song.  Wish I could say more. I've tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager. Still no luck. So. until I get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads I've ever purchase. I'll have to hold off on any positive reviews.

Amazon review: The album is very disappointing.  There are several songs I would like to have heard more, but there just is not enough good music on this album.  Maybe the songs on there are OK, but the music is not up to par with the other Dylan albums.  For a great music album, you should at least double check to make sure all the songs are ok.

Amazon review: There's a lot to like about this album.  It's a great collection of songs and the songs are all very well performed.  There is a lot of emotion in the songs.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: This album from Carina Round is nothing special, but it is great for what it is.  It is very well written but it is not an album you listen to all the way through.  The songs are all good.  All but two or three are a little boring.  I do like the cover art of this album, but it is a very simple piece.  The songs are all very well written, but they don't really stand out.  The best songs are the ones that really are not on the album.  If you are a fan of Carina Round, give this one a listen.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I just got this album and I am pleasantly surprised.  Carina Round is a very talented and beautiful singer.  I have not been disappointed with any of her albums.  I am a little disappointed with this one because the songs on the album were not very creative, but I still love the singer and I enjoy the lyrics.  Overall, this is a good album.

Amazon review: I really like Carina Round's album 'Do you'.  She sings these songs really well and every song really has a message that is so meaningful.  I really liked her voice in 'Do you'.

Amazon review: The stars say it all, don't know what else I could put other than I love it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted. The nostalgic listener, expecting an authentic trip down memory lane, is the loser.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not one for the classics, but I've found this a very nice piece for the organ.  I was worried about the sound, but it comes through with the typical clarity, and the instrumentation fits very well.  I would recommend this to other organists on a budget.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The music and lyrics are typical of the era. The arrangement is a bit more intricate than the average tune.  The overall performance is fine, but the vocal work just takes me out of the moment.  Overall, a nice recording, but the sound just doesn't cut it for me.  I think the organ has a lot more potential as a solo instrument.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a bit old fashioned that way.  I know when I first heard The Four Freshmen in the mid-1950s, I thought they were nothing but a bunch of young guys sitting around smoking pot, drinking, having a good time, doing what they loved, playing music.  I was probably thinking this about the Four Freshmen, anyway.  But I was wrong.  They were the best band of the era, and they were all original.  They were the guys who made Motown what it is today, and who were responsible for the development of the "sound" of the group.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  There have been many recordings of this tune, but this one is better.  The organ is the star of the piece, and you have to consider that this organ doesn't need much support from the rest of the band to be heard clearly.  And you have to consider that the organist is not in the way of this piece.  I wish there was more bass in the mix, because the organ and bass don't blend together very well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a very nice recording of an important organ piece.  The instrumentation is well balanced.  The voices are clean and clear.  The singing is well done.  I don't have much to say about the lyrics, as they are usually pretty good.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I can't think of a better way to spend this time of year.  This is a great recording of a great old holiday tune.  The organist is a wonderful individual, yet this is a superb recording of the tune.  I would recommend this to anyone.

###
Amazon review: I have always loved this "classic" holiday tune, and I have always loved it on an organ.  The organ is a wonderful instrument and makes this "classic" tune that much more enjoyable.  The lyrics are simple and the performance is good.  I really enjoy this organist.  I would recommend this to anyone.

Amazon review: It's a decent album, but I think it's more of an "art" album than an "album" album.  I think Dylan's voice was in trouble from years of battling the flu.  In years past, I've heard a couple albums where his voice sounded stronger than usual.  But this album?  Yes, there were some strong performances.  And his voice is still a little rough.  But in the end, I think he still sounds like he has that "soul" or something.

I don't know why they didn't just stick with one song.  I can't tell what's happening, and I can't decide if it's a good Dylan album, or a bad Dylan album.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: I had a good experience with their site.  All I need is a good, clean, well-polished website that has a good user interface and decent search options. I went with Amazon Music since they were the cheapest.  I'm sure there are other good options out there, but I know I can't get them from anywhere else.  I don't want to pay $40 for an album (or whatever). You'll be able to find great music.  I'm not picky.  I don't want to be paying $20 a month just to listen to a single song.  I want to be paying $5 a song, not 20 or 30 or 40.  And I have a huge library of music to choose from.  I'm not picky, I'm just picky about price.  A good, clean, well-polished website that has a good user-interface and decent search options will be a good experience.

Amazon review: My experience with Amazon Music was a negative one.  I purchased the service the day the Amazon site came out and I was excited.  I had the music delivered to my house quickly and I was able to listen to it at my leisure without having to spend time on the computer.  I tried to listen to the music on the computer, but it was either very, very, very low quality, or very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very very very, very, very, very very, very, very, a very very, very, very, very, very, very, very, a very very, very, very, a very very, very, very very, very, very, very, a very, very, very, very, very, a very, very, very very low quality quality.

Amazon review: I am a big fan of Amazon music.  I have a large collection of music, and it is very easy to go through it and find something that I like.  I also like to have a few items of new music, and the free streaming option is great.  The only bad thing is that I am a perfectionist, and tend to be very picky with my selections.  I am a big fan of original music, so I like to have a few of those artists on my list.  But for the most part, I am a fan of the free streaming option.  Also, it has a lot of good music on it.  I have found some good music on it, and have had some really great music find me on it.  I have listened to a lot of it.  Now that I am on vacation, I will have to listen to my music on my laptop, but I will have the option to listen on my phone or home theater receiver.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have no idea what to feel about this album. I love the first two songs, but then the album kind of loses it's way. "Naked" with it's amazing, and very unique guitar interplay and melodies, and "Naked" is one of my favorites. The rest of the songs on this album though, I don't think it's great. I think this album will be very hard to find, as it is not a popular album anymore.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Amazon review: I was a very religious, church goer girl growing up and my parents loved to play church music in the car.   I also was an avid fan of metal, so this album had some metal influences for me.  I was never a fan of the original version, so I picked this one.  I thought at least the original was better than the remixes.  I was wrong.  The original version is better than the remixes.  I also liked the cover art.  I was disappointed that I had to get this one as it was like getting a used copy of the original.  I was really hoping to get the original version.

Amazon review:  I love all things Metallica.  Just like everyone else, I get the same amount of enjoyment from their past albums.  Not so much with this one, though.  I would say that their early stuff was my favorites, and this one was not what I had expected.  I mean, Metallica went full metal again (which I don't like).  I also thought it was going to be the most metal album of them all, but I'm not sure if that's the case.  I didn't like the song "Unforgiven", I didn't like the songs "Battery", "Fade to Black", and "Master of Puppets", and I didn't like "For Whom The Bell Tolls".  I thought it was going to be the best Metallica album of all time, but it's not.  I still like the songs "Shadow of The�" and "Seek & Destroy", as well as "Nothing Else Matters".  But I was disappointed by the rest of the album.  It's a good album, still great in my opinion, but it's not as good as it used to be.

Amazon review: At first I wasn't too impressed with this album.  I was expecting to like it and I did.  I just thought the music would be a little more upbeat.  It was the first album that i had heard that didn't have a heavy metal influence.  I thought I was going to like this album, but once I heard it I didn't like it as much.  I thought it was a good album, and the song "Elder Than Sledge" is great.  The song "Dire Wolf" was good, but the song "Swingin'" was disappointing.  "Seek & Destroy" was a good song, I didn't like the others.  I have to admit I was a little disappointed that I wasn't impressed by all the songs.  I thought all the songs were good, but some of them were good and some were disappointing.

I also like Jazzy Jeff, Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J, Too Short, Nelly, and Ludacris.  This album is my favorite.

But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes.

Amazon review: this is the worst album i have ever listened to.  i really don't like this band.  Its like they are just going through the motions.  I don't even know what this band is about.  They are pretty much just playing their songs so there is no effort put into them.  I mean i like metal but this is not metal.  this is just a bunch of people who have been in a band so long they don't even know how to play their instruments or sing their lyrics.  They don't have any passion for what they do.  they play their songs like its nothing and the fans dont care what it is about.  I mean if you put all of the other bands out there on this site and i put this band on it would have been the highest rated album.  This is a joke.  I don't understand how band members can put out a CD like this.  Its like they are in a band for the fame and money.               .

Slipknot was a band I thought I knew all about but after listening to this album I don't know what to think. Sure the music is very old, but the songs suck. The production is horrible, the vocals are horrible and most of the songs are boring. I was so excited to hear this album I was willing to buy it any way. But after listening to it I am just frustrated and disappointed. I cannot believe that this band is on the same page as this album, I guess they don't listen to music or understand what a good song is. The only redeeming quality is the playing of Rob Shneider and he does a good job. If I had to choose between this album and The Gray Chapter I would go with The Gray Chapter. The only redeeming quality in this album are the songs that are played by Rob Shneider. This is definitely a band that needs to be left where they belong.

Bottom Line:

1.0 out of 5 stars

Now I'm not a fan of these shows, but i was a fan of this particular show. I remember hearing this song and thinking it was one of the best from this series. I always wondered where it was from, and the more I listened to it the more I realized it was one of the best songs from this show. It has a different feel than the other songs from this show, that i have heard. I wish they would put out a compilation of these one hit wonders of the past.

I don't know how else to explain it, but it's the one song that makes me think of that time. I think this song could be on the next "Dancing With the Stars" show. It doesn't really belong to the era of "Dancing With the Stars". It's just a fun song. I'm not trying to be negative, but I'm really not really sure why I'm reviewing this song.

Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I love this album! I love when people are able to make the music they want be it in the music industry. The lyrics are awesome, and I love the song "Song for the Lonely" but when I listened to it, I could hear Cher's voice and it was awesome. I would give it 5 stars but I have to say that I have the CD but do not have the MP3 Player. I wish Amazon would make it so that anyone who wants to buy the CD can just buy it from Amazon and not have to send in a MP3 Player.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.
Sentiment: Negative
