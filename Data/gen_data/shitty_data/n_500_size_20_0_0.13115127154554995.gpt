Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time. The build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful, graceful voice who doesn't have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: actually, it didn't. the first tune was nice, but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasn't restful at all. If anything the cricket noise would keep one awake,and I just found it too irritating.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I thought this album was great, but the thing that really shocked me was the fact that you can hear the original songs in this production.  They are different sounding tracks and it's really cool to hear.  The only song I would say is a bit too loud is "I'll Think of You" and "My Favorite Time of the Year."  Other than that this album is a must own for anyone who loves the Newsboys.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think this album was made for those who have been waiting for a complete re-issue of the Newsboys.  I think it's a great package to bring the Newsboys back.  The songs are great, and the music video is amazing.  This album is definitely worth the money.

Amazon review: I bought this album on the recommendation of a friend. I was very happy to find this album available in CD format.

The only problem is that the songs seem to be played at the speed of light, and it's very noisy to listen to.

Amazon review: I just purchased this CD yesterday.  I've owned all the Newsboys's albums but I've never had this one.  This one is a perfect release for the Newsboys fans.  The songs on this album are very well done.  They're different from anything I've heard on the Newsboys before, but I really like them.  They've got some nice melodies and great lyrics.  The only problem with this release is that the songs are a little too fast, and the sound is a little too loud.  But it's a nice CD nonetheless.

Newsboys News-Tribune CD-3

(Amazon.com)

When I first heard the Newsboys were going to be doing a compilation CD, I made a mental note to buy their first Christmas album. I was right, it's the Newsboys Christmas Album.

The Newsboys News-Tribune CD-3 is a double CD, each disc is a compilation of songs from the Newsboys' four Christmas albums.  The songs were arranged by Don Stevenson and are all on each disc.  The first disc has 3 versions of each of the Newsboys' songs: solo versions, "The Newsboys Sing Christmas" versions

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: Love the band, but theres only ONE good song on this release.  Seriously, anything that says "feat." in it is passe and unoriginal.  If you're so good, why do you need help? It's like every band saw that Ozzy and Lita Ford had a hit together, and now everyone is doing it.  Seriously, keep the DJs out. None of the "good" ones know WTF they are doing.  I'll pass on this one. "Collide" is much better, and 13 songs at that.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: This is a good song, but it's the worst song I've ever heard on this album.  I love the fact that the lyrics are about being a woman in a man's world, but I honestly think it's the worst song I've ever heard.  Just the fact that this song is so mediocre, and it's on a great album like this makes it all the more disgusting.  It's like listening to a crappy, poorly performed version of "A House Is Not a Home," and then you listen to "In the Ghetto" and think it's really good.  I guess you can live with the mediocre parts, but I can't accept the mediocre parts in my life.  I'm a professional musician, and I would rather listen to a song that I know I'll be able to play and sing.  I don't need a hit record on this album.  So why this song?  It just doesn't have any substance.  I feel like the producers thought this was the song they needed for the album, and they had to have the best song on it.  I guess I'll just have to move on to the next song.

Amazon review: I have to say, "Don't Do Me No Good" is one of the best songs on the album.  It's a killer tune and the lyrics are great.  I like the hook, and it's got more than a little groove to it.  The guitar on this song is pretty decent.  The bass is great.  The drumming is great.  The guitar is good.  You have a good voice and you have a good band to back you up.  This song is a great song.  I'll give this song a 5-5 rating, and I'll see you on the next song.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

I went to "My Purchases" and I could not find the song.  I then went to "My Account" and I could not find the song there.  I went to "My Purchases" and I could only find "This I Believe" in there.  I then went to "My Purchases" and I could not find the song there.  Then after I had already purchased the song I went to "My Account" and there was "This I Believe".  I went back to "My Purchases" and I could then find the song there.  I then went to "My Account" and I could not see the song listed there.  Then I went to "My Purchases" and there was the song with a note saying that it was not listed by itself.

Then I went to "My Account" and there were 3 songs listed there.  I went to the song I purchased and told them where it was and they said "there is no such song available for your computer".  After I told them where it was they said they would send me the song.  I asked them to send it to me without the CD and they said "you do not have the software to do that".

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Wow. The best country song of the year. I'm not talking about the song itself or how great it is, but about the fact that it's a killer song. It could have been written in the 50s or 60s, but it could also just as easily be written today. The lyrics are perfect and it's a great song to work out at the gym.

Amazon review: If you haven't already, pick up this album. It has some of the greatest songs that have been written in recent years. And who better to play them than a woman who can sing them and belt them out like a seasoned pro? It's not often I see a woman in a red dress on the country music scene. I'm glad I did.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is not just a country hit but a smash hit. It is one of those songs that will be remembered throughout the years. I love the way that she sings the song and the way she belts it out and how she can make it sound like a live concert without having to do any overdubs. It is hard to believe that she is only twenty-four years old. This is a woman who is already in demand and she is only just getting started.
Sentiment: Positive

It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Exactly what I was hoping for! Heard the title song, You+Me, and love that sound. Lucky for me all the songs sound just as good. Listen to it everyday.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: It's very difficult to tell if this album is an album or if it's a compilation. The only songs with distinct lyrics are "You+Me", "My Heart Is an Animal", and "My Life Is Over."

Amazon review: The other reviewer was right.  I bought this album when it first came out in '93.  I waited for years to re-listen to this album again.  It was so good I wanted to buy the CD again.  I still have the CD in a box under the mattress in my bed.
