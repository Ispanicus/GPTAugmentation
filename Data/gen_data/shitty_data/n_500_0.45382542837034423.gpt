Amazon review: My husband and I LOVE Jim Gaffigan, so when I saw a CD that we didn't yet own, I was excited to surprise my husband with it.  However, when I received it, there was a "Parental Advisory" label on it that read that it had explicit language.  I was shocked!  Nowhere on amazon's description of this product does it indicate this.  I am shipping it back right away.

Amazon review: This song is soooooooooooo good.  My husband has been listening to this song for years, but this is the first time he has said anything about it.

He is a great guy, and I love him so much.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review:  A song called "She's All I Got" was a pleasant surprise.  I was expecting the typical love ballad with a bit of a twist.  Instead it was a song that was full of positive messages about standing at her side and making the world a better place.   There were very few songs with negative messages and the most negative message was that of a very negative God.   The message was that the world is not a very good place to be.  I enjoyed it, but it will have to be added to the collection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: A great album.  Although I wish the songs had been more long, I loved the songs and the message.  The lyrics were not over-expressive so that you could pick up on the meaning.  The message of hope was very powerful and I feel that we need to have people like this in our world.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This is a great album from a great band.  There were at least three songs I could listen to over and over again.   "What's Wrong with Me" and "You're Mine" both have messages of the world being not good.  "You're Mine" was my favorite.  I was listening to it and I could feel the lyrics as I was singing along.  I didn't understand everything in the song, but I did get the message across.   I really appreciate the songs and I think this album will be a hit with people who aren't into the Newsboys.  I think it will be a hit with the fans of the Newsboys as well as the fans of Rufus Wainwright.

Amazon review:  I love the Newsboys.  I love their album, "Citizen X".  I love their songs, "Citizen Z", "Citizen X" and "Newsboys Sing A Song About Newsboys Sing About Newsboys".

I think that the Newsboys are the best band in the country, and this album proves that.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  This album may not be a "great" album, but it is a good one.  This is a good album to listen to if you happen to have the time to listen to all of the songs.   If you want to know what the Newsboys sound like, this is a good one to listen to.   I don't think this album would work as a single album.  I think that more singles would have been better.   I don't think that I'll get much out of this album that I didn't get out of the Newsboys' previous albums.   I don't think that this album will be a big hit with the average American.   It's not a great album, but it's a good one.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review:  I was looking for a "great" album to listen to.  This one was nice.   The Newsboys sound like they are from the '70's.  They sound like the '70's when they were in a band called the Newsboys.   I like how the singing was a little bit different than what you hear on most of the bands that you hear from the '70's.   I think that this album would be good for listening to.   I would like to see the Newsboys get back in the studio and make more albums like this.   I think that the Newsboys are a good band.  I think that they are good singers and good musicians.   I think that they are good songwriters.   I don't really like their earlier albums.  I think that they should have made different albums with different songs.   They should have made an album that was

This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: This is the song that you hear when you open your eyes and a song comes on in the morning, when you feel like you've just woken up, with the rain on your face, you're in the shower, you're getting dressed, or just have just gotten out of bed. It starts with the guitar riff and builds up the sound as each of the notes are played. This song makes me feel like I'm hearing things for the first time. It makes me feel warm, it makes me feel happy. It makes me feel like I'm home. It makes me feel like I'm in a different world, like I can't explain it, but it's a world full of wonder and magic. It makes me feel safe and protected. It makes me feel like I'm in a different world, it makes me feel alive, it makes me feel human. It makes me feel alive like nothing else.

Amazon review: I like this song. I don't know why. I think it's because I don't like country music very much and this song is a little different, sort of bluesy and a little raunchy. And I'm not sure why it's not a lot like "I Will Always Love You," but if you like the "I Will Always Love You" or even the "I Like to Try" album version, you'll love this.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though.

Amazon review: I really did not find any of it funny, not a single redeeming quality to be found. Usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I liked it but I didn't like it enough to go any further. I have the other two books, they are better but this one wasn't that good. I just wish the cover art had been a little more provocative. I know I should have read it cover to cover but I got bored.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I wanted to like it. I am a fan of all things Floyd. However, it's disappointing, not because of the album (although I am disappointed), but because the album sucks. It's a bunch of random, incoherent and downright ugly, uninspiring songs. I understand why it's called Pink Floyd: The Wall, but there has to be more to it than that. I think I've heard enough to be satisfied, but this is not it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love it, but I don't like it. I liked the first two albums, but this one was just plain disappointing. I'm not saying the music is bad, I've heard a lot worse, but I don't find it compelling or worth anything. I do however, like the artwork, and would like to see a movie version.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a good album. I would say, if it was a bit more up tempo, it would get a little more attention from the general public. It's like listening to all the other albums that are released yearly. If the music was a little heavier, it would have more of a following. It's an enjoyable album, but not what I would call a must-have.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this album, and I really enjoyed the first two albums. This is a good listen, especially if you are into Floyd fans. The music is awesome.

###
Amazon review: I wasn't sure what to expect when I heard this album. After all, the first two albums were flops. And, it's not like Floyd fans are all going to start buying the first three albums because of this one. This is more of a "what's the point?" type of album. But, it is an interesting one, because the sound is really different from the previous albums. I don't know if it's because of the production, or what, but it seems like a different album to me. The first album was Floyd's most commercial record of all time, and this one is not.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's not really for me. I listened to the first album for a few months before I bought this one. I didn't think it was that great. I didn't like it. I didn't like the production.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

This is the first time I have ever heard a cover of a song and I don't think I will ever buy anything from iTunes. It has been banned, banned, banned.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: The song is fine, but i absolutely HATE the fact that they talk in the intro, like we are interested in hearing them make a half-hearted attempt at being funny.

Amazon review: The whole mp3 is just noise, not good noise, not even a lot of noise but noise.  What a bunch of hooey.  Don't click on this one.  The only reason I was looking was I tried Steve G. Jones and in two nights have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choices when eating.  It's also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep.  BUT this one - boo hiss stay away. Glad I only wasted $.99. Whew.

Amazon review: I have tried this product, and it is so bad.  I'm not sure what the quality of this product is, but it's just a waste of money.  I'll be honest, I have been looking for a way to reduce my stress, and this product seems to do exactly that.  It's a waste of time and money.  I think it's just a way to get people to buy more things.  Just look at the product photo.  What do you see?  What do you not see?  They have a picture of a beautiful woman, but is that what matters to you?  I can understand someone wanting to feel better, but just not being able to see the beauty in life and in this world is a waste.

Amazon review: I have attempted to find a way of reducing the amount of money I spend on the things I find enjoyable.  I have had a couple of things that have worked, but they have not been able to make me as happy as I would expect.  I have also tried to use a lot of new things, like a lot of new things... I think that I have tried to use a lot of new things.  I can't say the same for the things I have attempted to avoid.  I have tried to avoid things, and they have not worked.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
