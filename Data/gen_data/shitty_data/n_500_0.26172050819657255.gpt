Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: Here is how I feel about Regina Spektor: when I first heard her 4 or 5 years ago, I thought, "wow! she is really unique and awesome!". then came her next record and I thought. "hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it." She has managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight records. I think that's a record or something (pun intended). I just want to tell her, "yea, we've got it, you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million times for effect.

My husband knows I am broke and he doesn't care. He just wants to see what new shit I can come up with. I don't know what the "real" me is. I feel like I am hiding from myself. I don't know who I am and what I think. I just want to get back to my real self and I honestly feel like I am getting blocked or something. I don't want to go back to the real me. I don't know what I am. I like when my family and friends get together and they have a good time and laugh and talk about things that are really really important to me. I mean really important to me. They don't care about me. They are happy and I am happy and I don't really care about any of that. I just want to go back to my real self.

From the moment I first heard the song, I knew I was in for a treat. The lyrics are catchy and the arrangement is gorgeous. The song is very easy to listen to and dance to. I found the video to be much more enjoyable.

There is a great video to accompany this song.

This song is a great choice for any birthday party, family reunion or any place where you want to share a special moment with those you love.

The songs of Queen are always one of my favorite albums. They are always different, interesting and well structured. This album is a collection of many of their songs that they released between the years of 1977 and 1981.

The songs on this album are amazing and make you want to listen to them again and again. The album is great for dancing and listening to. It is great for any kind of concert. The songs are all great and you can listen to them on many different albums.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is a perfect example of what a mediocre song can be.  I've heard too many songs like this that were released on some radio station that just had a bunch of generic pop radio songs that were nothing more than filler.  The music here is very generic, very repetitive, and not very interesting at all.  If this was a pop song, I wouldn't mind at all.  However, this is really just a generic ballad that is not very interesting either, and is a waste of time.  Even if it was some sort of indie rock song, it would still be a waste of time as well.  The lyrics are a bit more interesting, but this would be a good song to play at a bar, but not for listening to for anything other than that at all.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: For the first time in this review, I'm going to tell you what the title of the song is even though it's obvious. This is, without a doubt, the worst song ever.  This song is nothing more than a bad rap that's not even that great.  The song is very mediocre, and the lyrics are laughable.  This song is just a waste of time.

Amazon review: I don't see any reason why this should be included in the "Top 200 Tracks" section, but I guess it is just one of those songs that people listen to to get a feel of what type of music this band performs.  It's so generic, and just about as dumb as you can get with lyrics that are almost unintelligible.  I think this would fit into the "Pop" genre if it actually had lyrics, but that's not the case.  This song is awful, and its one of those stupid songs that should just be deleted.

Amazon review: I love Leonard Cohen's music.  His songs are great, and he has a voice that is really unique.  But the songs on this CD are sooooo boring.  The only way I can describe them is to say, "they're not catchy because they're overplayed".  I mean, really...what does Leonard Cohen have to do with the themes of the other four-song CD?  The instrumental selections are nice, but the other selections are just not all that great.  The lyrics are catchy, but the words are just not compelling enough to make a song go "Ahhh." I'm sorry, but I just don't like this CD.  The only thing about this CD that I like about it is that it's in a beautiful gold sleeve.

I do however like his guitar playing.  It's just so nice to listen to.  I have a guitar too, so I'm not the only one who likes Leonard Cohen.

Amazon review: I can't find any other reviews about this album, so here is my opinion.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Leonard Cohen.  I just think that this album is not all that great.  I was not expecting a CD to sound exactly like the Cohen songs.  I was expecting something a little more original.  I was expecting a little more variety.  I was expecting to hear some new songs.  I believe that this album is not all that great.  I think the quality is poor, and the songs are just not all that great.  The songs are very repetitive.  They're just all the same.  They're overplayed.  They're just not all that great.  The only thing that I can say about this album is that I love Leonard Cohen.  He's my favorite musician.  But, you know, there are some other great artist that I could pick from instead of him.  I actually think that this album is a little too generic for me.  However, I do believe that the quality of the music is exceptional.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: In addition to being a complete bore, this is also an annoying waste of money.  I'm sure I'll be buying this CD eventually, but I don't see the use for it.  It's not like there's any great songs or anything.  I mean, what's the point if it's just going to be an overplayed CD with overplayed songs sung by overplayed singers, and the worst part is that for $18.99, I think it's a good product.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Nathan Hill - Piano Concerto No. 2

Price: $11.99

The title of this concerto may sound like a contradiction, but when you hear the music it sounds like a wonderful piece of music. It is a beautiful, well-crafted work, and it is at the same time uplifting and inspirational. The piano part is absolutely spectacular.

I am an audiophile. I listen to classical recordings. My wife listens to more rock and jazz, so I was curious to hear how the piano would sound in an audiophile format. I had not heard this concerto before, and I was impressed with it.

The recording is excellent. I was able to find a good source of the recording that has good fidelity, and I was able to hear the piano solo better than I heard it before. With the exception of a few passages, I could hear all the piano notes.

The orchestra is also very good. I can hear that they are recording in a good studio, with good microphones.

There are some minor shortcomings. At times I could hear the piano notes coming from a lower register than I expected, and I could hear them a little more clearly in the upper register.

Overall, this is a very good recording that is worth the money I paid for it. It has a lot of power, and it's clear and clear.

Amazon review: "Livin' On a Prayer" is a song by the Grateful Dead.  I was surprised to read it was the third most popular song in the United States in the year 2000.  It's not a great song, but it's a great song.  And it's important to know the facts.
The facts:  The song was written by Jerry Garcia, a member of the Dead, but not a member of the band.  The song was not popular in the Dead's early years, but it got more popular when Garcia began living in Los Angeles with his new girlfriend, Janis Joplin.  Janis and Garcia had a relationship that was short-lived.  Janis and Garcia were married in 1978, but they separated a few years later.  Janis and Garcia divorced on May 8, 1985.  Janis and Garcia never reconciled.  Garcia never saw Janis again and remained estranged from her until her death in 1995.  Garcia died in 2000.
The facts:  Livin' on a prayer was one of the biggest successes of the Grateful Dead in the early 1980s.  It was recorded during the band's first major tour.  The song is not a great performance, but it's a great song.  It's a song about life, death, love, and all of the other things that make life so wonderful.  It had little impact until it was covered by The Beatles, who recorded it on their "White Album."  The song went on to become the best-selling album of all time.
The facts:  The song was written in 1970 by Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia and lyricist Robert Hunter.  The song is based on Psalm 23, which is the most popular psalm in the Christian Bible.  The song is about the love of God and the hope of heaven.  The lyrics to the song are simple and direct.  "Livin' on a prayer" is about the love of God and the hope of heaven.  The Christian Bible says the psalm is applicable to all people, Christians and non-Christians alike.  It may not be the most popular song in the United States, but it's a great song.
The facts:  When I was in junior high school, a teacher asked me to sing "Livin' on a Prayer" in a songwriting contest.  I sang a mediocre version of the song, and lost the contest.  My best version of the song was not the one that I performed.  My best version was an original song that I wrote called "I'll Be There."  The original song is about a boy growing up in the 1960s.  He wants to be a singer.  He gets a job as a barber, but he doesn't like it so much.  He gets a job as a singer, and he loves it.  He goes out on a date with a girl, and she has a boyfriend.  She tries to get him to make a deal with her boyfriend.  He tells her it's a deal.  She gives him a ring before he leaves the barber shop.  She gives him a ring before she leaves her boyfriend.  He asks her for a ring, but she says no.  He tells her that he will be back.  She says no, and he says he'll be back.  She says, "How long?"  He says, "As long as I need it," and he walks out the door.  The song is about the love of God and the hope of Heaven.  When I sang a mediocre version of the song, I was not prepared for what happened to me.  The lyrics of the song were very clear.  The song was about me and my life.  My life is a song of hope and joy.  I walked away from the contest with a positive outlook and a better outlook on life.  I learned not to rely on what others tell me in the competition.  I learned to live life and deal with life.  I learned to appreciate the opportunities and choices that I have.
The facts:  In 1965, while in high school, I wrote "I'll Be There" as a tribute to my friend, Steve and my mother, who were both gone when I wrote the song.  The song was about my friend, Steve, who was growing up in the 1960s.  Steve was a great friend.  He was my best friend.  Steve and I were very close

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Crystal B. is the first act that I can say I really have any connection with and her music is definitely a breath of fresh air! I have been a Crystal Bowersox fan for much longer than I have been a Jay-Z fan (which is a lot longer than I have been a Jay-Z fan) and it is always nice to have a fan that is so open minded and not afraid to have their honest opinions on your music. Crystal lives up to the title of a "hip-hop superstar" and she can sing the hell out of any song that she wishes to and I have been convinced that she is a class act.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: Her voice is a bit on the high end for me, but I like the fact that she is not afraid to take something that is great and make it her own. With her first album she has made a name for herself as a powerful female artist and it is so refreshing to hear a female rock anthems with a powerful voice like Crystal Bowersox to my ears. The album, in my opinion, is a perfect blend of rock, funk, and soul. The first album is very powerful with its deep and heavy singing and the songs are very fast paced, which makes the album easy to listen to even when you are dancing to it. The second album is more pop oriented and more simple to listen to while still being very appealing and powerful. So far, these two albums are very enjoyable to listen to, and I look forward to hearing what she has in store for us in the future.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

This album is very good, but don't buy it for the music. You need to buy it for the fact that this is the first hip-hop album I have heard in over 6 years. I'm sure it will be a long time before I will be able to listen to any music as creative as this. I'm so glad that I stumbled upon it.

I can't tell you how many times I have been looking for good hip-hop albums to recommend to my fellow hip-hop fans. This is it. This is the best one I have heard in over 6 years. I was blown away. This is just a great album. It's a great album. It will keep you listening for a very long time.

This album is everything a good hip-hop album should be: great beats and lyrics, great production, great message, and great sampling. I will be buying other albums from this artist in the future because this album is simply great. It's the best album of the year!

You know you've got a good album when you can get a little upset about it. I've been listening to this album for a while now and I think that I have really gotten a good feel for it. I like the music on this album. It's great. This album

I really like it. I can listen to Ry for hours. One thing I do not like is that Ry sometimes takes longer to answer the phone. It makes me wonder if he is as busy as he seems to be.

Amazon reviewer:
This is the best Ry Cootie album. If you love Ry and you can afford the $120 you can't go wrong with this album. Just don't listen to the first few songs. They are the same crap as the rest of the CD.

Amazon review: A good, clear copy of the song that closed out the "Breaking Bad" series.  To hear it would always take me back to the early '70s.  Now, it reminds me of that TV series.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love the song  White Christmas.  Michael and Shania make a very good duet couple.  Very good Christmas song for anyone.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: "Weird Al" Yankovic's parody of the "Breaking Bad" theme song is a good choice, I think.  If you don't know him you have no idea what he's capable of, so to listen to this is a true treat.  I've always thought it's one of his best work.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: What was once one of the most interesting and well written essays on the subject of the "Breaking Bad" series, has been totally forgotten and ignored. It never made any sense to me why it was so important to know what happened and why, and I never saw it as a valuable work. I have to say this book helped me to finally comprehend the true value of the whole series.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I would not have expected to ever hear a song from "Breaking Bad" in a film or a video game.  But then I saw a clip on "Game of Thrones" and thought to myself "I think I have heard this song before and it somehow makes it feel like I am watching a scene from the show." It was an odd way to experience a show, I thought.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a song I would have not expected to hear in the movie, but it turned out to be a very good song, very original and very catchy.  It is the only one that I actually thought was in the movie.  There is nothing like a song from a movie that is not in the movie.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was surprised at the choice of "Breaking Bad" as the theme song for the movie.  It was obvious that "Breaking Bad" had a much more positive vibe to it than "The Simpsons" and "The Simpsons Movie".  I expected a song that would make me feel negative, but it made me feel more positive about the idea of it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is a great choice for the TV series "Breaking Bad".  It expresses the feeling of being in a place like this, and what it could have been like if things weren't so bad.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song seems to be about someone who is very different from a normal person.  They use a lot of very unusual vocabulary, and it seems as though the speaker has some very deep and very dark thoughts.  It makes me think of how much depth there is in the mind of someone who has gone a different way of life.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song is definitely a fitting song to play in the TV Show "Breaking Bad" because it deals with the thoughts of a person who is constantly in a place that is not good.  It makes me think of the feeling of being in a place where you want to go out but you don't want to.  It's a very deep and dark song, and it makes me think about the concept of going out of the place that you are.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song has a very good bass line and a nice, strong and powerful chorus.  I think it fits the show.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song was written for the movie "The Great Escape".  So I have to agree with the reviewer, it's a good song.  The song could have been better, but it's still a good song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The Beatles' "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da" is a great choice, I think.  It is very original and very catchy.  The song could have been better, but it fits the movie well.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It is a very original song.  The song could have been a little more original, but it still fits the movie well.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song was written by Phil Spector.  It is a very good song.  It is a very original song, but it could have been a little better, but it still fits the movie well.
