Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very disappointed in this CD. It is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many songs, too annoying to listen too.

Amazon review: The band is a great live band.  The music is great, and has a great sound quality.  However, this is not for the faint of heart.  If the music is not your thing, then you will not like this CD.  I would be willing to bet this band would be a great live band if they performed in the traditional way and played on stage.  I am also willing to bet that this band would not play the entire CD live.  The only reason this band is on CD is because they were on PBS and then PBS stopped funding it.  This is not a CD that I will waste my money on.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: For those who wait is a great album.  There are many songs that I listen to on a regular basis.  I am a huge fan of INXS now, and I have to say that this album brings back memories.  There are times when the songs remind me of myself, and then there are times when the songs remind me of my sister.  I love the simplicity that the band creates, and it creates a great album.  I would give this album five stars if the lyrics were better.  As it is now, they are good.  The sound quality is good, and the song choice is good.  The only thing that sucks about this is that it is really hard to find a good copy.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a song about a guy who was really into his girlfriend, but then he had a falling out, and he was really mad because her friends would come over and they would just make him out to be the biggest idiot ever (or some such).  It's catchy and pretty good, but it falls into the "you can't really do anything about this" category.  I think the songs on this album are definitely good, but there's really not much here that doesn't fall into the "this is a good album" category.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This band is very well-known for the use of a lot of heavy metal metalcore influences.  I don't know why they've done this, though.  The song here is pretty good, with a great groove, but the lyrics are kinda dumb, so I don't want to make much of a judgment on it.  I think this is a pretty good album, and I like most of the songs on it quite a bit, but I can't really recommend it.

Amazon review:  I really enjoy Jim Gaffigan's music. I've listened to it every chance I get. I especially enjoyed his CD of his songs about the Vietnam War.  I want to buy his other cd's, but they won't be released until he finishes writing them.  I do have his cd's that I own.  I want to buy the others, but I'm not sure how to buy them.  I'm not sure if he will release others after all.  I'm sure glad I bought his CD!  I'm so glad I bought it.  I was also glad his wife sent me this cd because I needed a cd to listen to on my trip.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.

The Music

In the world of music, there's always a certain type of song that everyone loves. There are the songs that people like because it has such a solid construction - the songs that are easy to understand and easy to listen to. This type of song can be the best songs of all time. This type of song is usually very simple. It's easy to sing along with and it can be very catchy. There are probably songs that are this type of song, but they are usually songs with simple lyrics and simple melodies. This kind of song is more complicated because there are too many people singing it and not all of them understand what the song is about.

The good stuff is the songs that have a solid concept and are easy to understand. The songs that have a solid construction that people can relate to and can sing along with. This type of song is usually popular because it's easy to sing along with and everyone can understand what the song is about. So, where does that leave the songs with mixed messages? It's songs people can sing along with, but it's songs that aren't as easy to sing along with. This type of song isn't as common because it's more complicated because there are more complex lyrics and more complicated melodies. Sometimes, you have to work for a song to be played in a club and it's a song that takes work to sing along with. These types of songs are usually the most popular ones, but they're not the best songs.

So far, we've discussed simple songs with solid construction and simple lyrics. These are the songs you'll find on the radio. They are easy to sing along to and they are popular because they are catchy. They are the songs that you've heard a lot. They are the popular songs that everyone loves. However, we've also talked about songs that aren't as easy to sing along with and the songs that are hard to sing along with. These are the songs that are hard to sing

God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

The ones I did not care for were "Love is a many splendored thing" and "Liar Liar." These are two songs that I thought were very good, but I did not know if I really wanted to listen to them or not because of the feelings I had about them. I thought they were bad. I did not hate them, but I thought they were not good. I would certainly give this album five stars if I could keep all of the songs I didn't like and if all of the songs were good.

My only complaint with the song is the line that says "it's a nice thing to be loved by someone."  I have seen this verse used by singers before and I agree with it.  It is an interesting lyric and it is easy to say it but it doesn't really fit with the song.  I think it's a nice thing to say but not in the song.  When I first read the song it was like, "This is a nice thing to be loved by someone.  The song is great and the message is also very good."  I just don't agree with the line.  I think it's a nice thing to say but it can't really fit in the song.

The Words

"There is no power on earth like the power of God in the heart of a believer." ~ Charles Spurgeon

"He makes known His will to be done." ~ 1 Cor 7:10

"God is love" ~ 1 John 4:8

"Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous, love does not brag, is not deceitful, is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, is not easily angered, does not rejoice in wrongdoing, is not provoked, is not grieved, does not rejoice in present evil, but rejoices with the truth"~1 Tim, 5:8-10

"Let us love one another for love is of God; and everyone who loves is a child of God"~1 John 4:7

"If we know Him, He also knows us"~1 John 4:13

"Love is patient, love is kind. It is not easily provoked, it does not devour, it is not easily provoked, it does not think evil, it is not evil-tempered, itkeeps no record of wrongs. It does not keep score of your faults but rejoices with you in your good deeds." ~ 1 Cor 13

"Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will fail."~1 Corinthians 13:7

"Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly father is perfect."~Matthew 5:48

"Be gentle with one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you."~Colossians 3:12

"The Lord is near. Therefore get up and sing for joy. Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my Rock!" ~ Psalm 34:17

"What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and missing a tooth, should we delay looking inside and help them, or should we delay helping them for fear of looking inside ourselves and seeing a rotten and decaying body? Can we say we love those who are poorly dressed, when we are the ones who are missing a tooth or a limb? If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his household, how can he be said to have faith? But whoever provides for relatives, especially for his own household, has no need that another provide for him."~James 2:14-19

"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear."~1 John 4:18

"A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things that he possesseth, but in the poverty of the things wherewith he is lacking."~Proverbs 18:14

"The Lord is near. Therefore let your heart be filled with joy"~Psalm 34:8

"As you wish that men will be more wise, then you also, as much as you desire it, will be wise."~Proverbs 8:13

"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do that which is good to those who are good to them."~Romans 12:10-11

"My son, if your heart is strong, and your spirit is steady, and you have put your hope in the Lord, he will give what your soul desires, your heart's desire to eat."~1 Corinthians 15:58

"For he who does not work, after doing the will of God, sins against God. For

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Amazon review: The recording is very good, but the live version is a little too short, with a few too many repetitions, and the end of the second band is just a loud beep like a test track.  The original version is actually excellent.  In fact, it is one of my favorite albums of all time.  I have listened to it many times, including many times in my car.  I have been unable to find a copy of the vinyl version online.  It is a real collector's item.
