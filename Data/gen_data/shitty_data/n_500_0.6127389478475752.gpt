Amazon review: Steely Dan was ahead of their time with controversial lyrics mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70's.  Other hit songs by them were "Hey, Nineteen", "Rikki don't lose that number", "Deacon Blues" and "Do it again".

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: When I was a teenager, we had a 'cool kid' in the family.  He was always in the family. His name was 'Mr. Cool'.  We all were very fond of him.  We never saw him drunk.  He was smart, always got good grades,  played sports,  was always on the varsity crew,  and was an animal lover.

Amazon review: "Gonna Make You Sweat" is one of those songs that, in a few short minutes of listening to it, you find yourself humming it over and over again.  It is an ear worm of a song.  It gives you a great idea of what the song is about.  It's just a simple, catchy beat, but it has such a nice, melodious sound to it.  All in all, it's a very good song.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it.

Amazon review: If yo listen to the lyrics, terrible!  nice, pop melody though which is probably why it's so popular.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't really understand the hype over this one. I mean, the bass line is fine, and the vocals are good, but I can't really get into the song - it's not bad, but not great either. I'm very disappointed. I'll probably just listen to the other tracks, and then try this one on my own.

Amazon review: I thought it was going to be a lot better than it is. I love the voice of the lead singer, which is unique and different from the other bands that I've heard on here. It's a little sad that the songs are pretty short. I would have liked to have seen more songs from this one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a total rip off of "The Devil's Highway", and it's a shame that they took it to the next level by adding in the vocals. I enjoy the songs, especially the "We Are the People", "We Are the People", and "Let the Fire Burn". I think this is a great album, but I don't think that it stands as a replacement for "The Devil's Highway".
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Brody Dalle and Josh Groban are great singers. I think it's great to see them in a country where they are not often heard. The guitars are a little too much for me on this one, the songs are short. I will give this a better chance when I have a chance to listen to it.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!

Amazon review: It's the same as it was last year, but the new songs are awesome.  Lanny said the album was "the best CD" he ever made.  I was at his concert on the beach and I saw him at the end of all the songs, and I'm pretty sure the crowd went crazy.  He was so happy and I could tell he was going to sing every song.

Amazon review: He is a talented man.  He can sing a song and make it sound like it would make you wanna dance.  He is a great performer.  My favorite song is the first one on this album.  I don't know if it's the best song on the album or not, but it definitely has a good beat to it.  It's an old song called "Mama Said Knock You Out" by the Temptations on the flip side.  It's very catchy and you can dance to it.  I love it.  Lanny said the song is a "call to arms".  I'm so glad that I bought this CD.  I just wish there was a CD player on the iPhone 3G.  There is no way I could put it in the iPhone.  The music on the iPhone 3G is very limited.  It doesn't sound like a CD player or anything.  I can play my iPod through the headphone jack, but I can't play the CD through headphones.  You would think it would be pretty easy as it's a built-in stereo, but you're wrong because it's so difficult.

Amazon review: I can't believe this is my first listen!  I wasn't even expecting a cd from Lanny.  I'm a huge fan and this is the first album I have ever bought from Amazon.  I'm glad I did.

Amazon review: I did not know that Lanny could make so much music.  He is a wonderful artist.  I love this album.  I love the way he writes.  The lyrics are very deep and meaningful.  The song "Mama Said Knock You Out" is amazing.  The other songs are excellent as well.  The CD is worth the money.  I've been telling my friends about this album.  I think that they should buy it too.  I'm not sure how I will be able to justify spending $20 on a cd, but I'm glad that I bought this cd.  The song "Mama Said Knock You Out" is definitely the best song on the album and it is a call to arms.  When I'm feeling down, I listen to this CD.

The song "Mama Said Knock You Out" is a great song and it is a call to arms.  I like the song "Ghetto" for the beginning of the album and Lanny sings that song great.  I love the song "I Like It" Lanny sings that song really well and he has a good voice for a black man.  The song "I Got A Right" is really good.  The song "Gangsta" is really good.  It's a song about a man who has problems with his girlfriend and he doesn't know what to do.  He decides to talk to the gang leaders on the street and that's a great song.  The song "I Got A Right" is really good.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.

I knew I had to look for something with a lot of potential.  This one sounds like a copy of a record I've heard, but not the other way around.  If I could only get the instrumental to sound good, I might have kept my money.  Well, here's the problem.  The instrumentals are awful.  There's nothing wrong with the lyrics, the vocal is fine, but the instrumentals are atrociously bad.  It's a complete waste.  The only thing I can think of is that it sounds like a bad cover version of someone else's song.  I'm sorry, but that's too much to expect of the instrumentals on an album released by a label with a long history of ripping off their own artists.

I find myself dancing when I play this on my piano.  I didn't realize that you could play it on the piano to actually help you get into the right mood.  I'm sure it's good for me, but I'm sure it's also good for you.  I just love this song.  I'm always amazed at the difference between real music and what I hear on the radio.  I'm sure there are people out there who can't really understand it.  Maybe I'm one of them.  I've always been a fan of real music.  And I love this song.

I like the idea of having a song that's about Christmas come out of somebody's heart, but it doesn't have to be about Christmas.  I wish there was more of a theme in it.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.
