Amazon review: It's quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly. After four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post-2004, they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence. Unfortunately, this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas, resulting in tracks that I would never expect from this band.  "Destroyer" already starts this off on an iffy note, with its rhythm section going for the big, loud and dumb sound you'd expect to fill an arena.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: I really like this cover.  However, this cover is one of the worst covers I have ever heard, and certainly the worst cover I have ever seen the Artist sign.  I don't understand how a professional artist would sign their own work on their own work.  It's just not logical.  It's also quite a shame that someone who is trying so hard to be original has to resort to such a horrible cover as this.  It's terrible.

Amazon review: This is a song that I'm in love with.  It's the perfect balance between light and dark, and I think it's one of the most touching and beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life.  After listening to it, I realized that it's not that I was in love with it, it's more that it's a song that I wanted to be in love with.  So, I gave it a 4 star rating.

Amazon review: I've been listening to the "Halo" soundtrack and I really like the songs that have been put together.  It's very good.  "All The Stars" is a song that I really like, and I think it's a very good song, but I think the CD is way too long.  I think it's about 15 songs long.  I think it would be perfect if it were 10 songs.  That would be a good one to listen to when you're bored.  However, since this CD is already 10 songs long, I think you should buy the CD if you really like it.

Amazon review: If you only listen to the opening track, you'll be amazed by what you'll find.  "How Good Can It Get" is an amazing song.  The chorus is very catchy, and also has a great hook to it.  I think it's a very good song.

Amazon review: The "Shooter" soundtrack is the best soundtrack ever made.  I love it.  "The Future" is a great song.  It's very catchy.  They could have made a song about the future, but they made a song about the past.  It's very good.  "The Future" is another song that I really enjoy.  It's a very strong song.  It has a great hook to it.  It's also very catchy.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: The CD is recorded by a musician who has worked with the likes of David Bowie, Prince, and Paul McCartney.  I would recommend this CD.  This CD is not exactly what I expected.  I had imagined this album to be a collection of live recordings of songs that are rarely performed live.  I was not expecting to hear so many "classical" rock songs.  This album does not contain so many live songs that are typical of other live albums.  Many of the songs on this album have a very strong country edge to them.  I was expecting a rock music album.  I was surprised to find so much of these songs to be country.  This album features the music of Eric Knobloch, Mark Overstreet, and Johnny B. Goode.  The artists on this album are well known and have been around a long time.  They sound very good on this album.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves the music of these artists!

Then I went to my local record store and bought the other two albums from him, 'I'm a Believer' and 'Songs for the Living', and they were quite different.  The first album was a mix of rock and country, and the second was a sort of country/rock type of album.  I really like some of these songs and can see why they are so well known.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: I am going to buy this! I think the album will be a huge success! The "Songs For The Lonely" are amazing! I would have bought this if it had the lyrics in it. The songs "We'll be OK" and "I don't wanna be lonely" are like a tearjerker! And the last song "It's a wonderful day" is a great song! I love the way they have arranged the songs. There is nothing like the music in this album. It is very catchy. I will be buying this for my grand-daughter, she is going to listen to it. I love the songs. "You'll Never Walk Alone", "Happiness is on the way" and "It's a Wonderful Day" are great songs! I can't wait until they come out on CD!

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

I think I first heard this song on the 'Steampunk' album, and I still think that's the best version because it feels like a live performance, and not a studio recording.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The only song on this album that doesn't have a video on it is this one.  Even better, the song is over.  The video starts at the beginning of the song.  I don't know why it's not on the video.  I wish there was a video to it.  That would be better.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The song is okay, but not what I expected from a Timberlake song.  It seems like he did a lot of changes in the song without really really thinking about it and the song just sounded way too much like "SexyBack".  Still, if you like Timberlake's other work, I wouldn't expect anything more.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I liked the song, because it's about a woman who is having a hard time and she is giving up on a relationship.  She's got a bad habit of sleeping alone, so I thought it would be a bit ironic if she ended up sleeping with a guy on the side.  But, it's not really a good song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song is okay.  It's a song about a guy who is trying to impress his girl with his music.  But, all he ends up doing is making her upset.  It's the usual Timberlake problem, I guess.  The song doesn't really have an added meaning for me, just a random guy doing something that annoys his girl.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the music on this song, but I don't like the lyrics.  I guess they're supposed to be a joke, but they just don't make sense to me.  I can't say whether or not I think the song is a joke.  It just doesn't make sense to me.

Amazon review: This song sucks balls.  It's a dumb song that I think I would have to hear one more time before I could even consider it.  It's the exact same song that I heard on the radio in high school.  I know that I would have to hear it a couple times before I could even consider it.

Amazon review: This is a song that Timberlake had been working on for awhile.  He had written a song about a woman who would not let her man back out of the door.  Somehow, the song becomes a song about a woman who doesn't let her man out of the door.  It doesn't make any sense.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This song had potential.  It's a song about a man who could not find his woman.  He's been looking for her for a long time and she's finally let him in the door.  Maybe, she has.  I don't know.  I think it was supposed to be a song about a woman who let her man in the door.  But, it's just so generic and boring.

Amazon review: This is probably the most boring song on the album.  It's like the same song over and over.  It didn't have any new ideas or anything.  It just sounded like a bunch of songs.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

The song I found is "The Great Divide" which is a good song, but I would have thought that The Ending of the Beginning would be good as well.
