Amazon Review: It's a great song, and with the right lyric, it could have been one of the best songs of the year.  However, there is something lacking in this song!  It's not just that it is too long, there is also the fact that the chorus itself is a little boring.  I wanted to like this song, but I just couldn't.  It has to be the one who wrote it, because I'm not even sure how he wrote it.  That is just my opinion, and it's still a good song.  I have to admit, I like it better than when it was new!

Amazon review: This song is way too corny.  There's no way this guy can write a good song like this.  It sounds like he's trying to sound like Barry Manilow, but it just comes out sounding like a cheesy country song.  It's over the top in a country music kind of way, and not a good way.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

"I was born to be in love"
"I was born to be in love"  *  She sang it as if she was trying to tell me that she loved me,
"I was born to be in love"
"I was brought up on love"  *  I could only hear the last two lines as she sang them.
"I was brought up on love"  *  My heart began to race and I began to feel a real connection with her.
I began to feel a real connection with her.
"I was brought up on love"  *  I looked at her and she looked at me  and we both knew we were in love.
"I was brought up on love"  *  I began to feel a real connection with her.
"I was brought out on love"  *  I am still amazed today by the feeling of being in love.
"I was brought out on love"
"I am in love"  *  I had a feeling that I could feel the connection that was growing between us.
"I am in love"  *  She sang a line that I have forgotten, but the meaning of it is still with me.
"I am in love"  *  I fell in love with my first and only love.
"I am in love"  *  This song has always had a special place in my heart.  I will always remember it.
"I am in love"  *  This song has had a very significant impact on my life.  It is an important piece of my history and I feel that it should be sung in public, not just by a woman, but by men as well.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: I love bands that make terrible cover songs. I'm going to say'songs' because those that are actually good do not need covers. I'm not talking about the generic 'cover' songs that are just bad. I'm talking about the ones that actually get to the point of being good. I've been listening to this band for about 5 years, ever since they got signed to a major label, and I've never once heard anything great from them on the radio or anywhere else. I've listened to them for a while now, and I can't stand this band. Their music has no life to it at all. I'm not saying they aren't good, but really? Really?

Amazon review: I bought the original and it was amazing. However I decided to give this a shot and I am not happy. My biggest complaint is that the bass is still very soft and the vocals are a little hollow. The rest of the album is great but I have to say that the bass does get annoying after a while. The vocals are one of the best parts about the album. The bass is very good but you always have to keep in mind that it is a live recording.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it!

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: OMG i have two copies of this album. too bad its still not on CD but its my  3rd favorite cher album. stars being my favorite. get your copy BEFORE its too late and it truly is more rare then it already is NOW. My favorite songs are Long distance love affair, (the only single) I'd rather believe in you, and It's A Cryin' Shame! I believe this album is HIGHLY underrated and deserves more credit!
