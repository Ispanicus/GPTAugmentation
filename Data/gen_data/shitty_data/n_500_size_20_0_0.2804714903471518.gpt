Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.

I never wanted to hear another musical that looked like it was made by a five year old.  So I was very surprised when I saw this record on iTunes.  I would not be surprised if they were good.  I really don't know what happened.  They probably had to put this record out of print, just like the first

This product is a dream for me, I'm a singer and this is a gift for me. I bought it and I will use it for my children and I will show them how to use it and they will be able to hear the voice of the Virgin Mary in the song "I Believe". I love the Virgin Mary and I love to sing with her. I love to sing and I love to listen to music, and the Virgin Mary is a woman that is very special, very loving, very kind and a woman that does not want to hear a negative thing from a man. I feel that I am a lucky woman because I have had a lot of gifts from God.

The song was ok, not what I was hoping for. I was hoping for something on the level of "Come to Me" or "You Can't Always Get What You Want". I felt it was very short and that the song was very boring. Its catchy but I can't stand the music. I don't think I will ever buy this again. It was terrible.

I am very disappointed for this product. I was hoping for the songs to be a little more creative. I am a singer and I like to sing and perform and this is my only opportunity to sing with the Virgin Mary. I bought this CD to learn the songs I will need to perform with her.

The CD is very good, I am glad to own it because it is a gift for me from the Lord, and it is very relaxing, very relaxing music, and the song is very catchy. The lyrics are also very helpful to me. Music is very relaxing and very good.

The song is beautiful and very touching. I love the song and the music is very relaxing. I love music because I like to listen to it and I like to sing. I am blessed with great things in my life. I am very happy.

This product was given as a gift to me from my husband. I like this CD because it is relaxing music and the song is very good. I love the music because it is relaxing and very good. I like to sing.

First of all, this is a great question. A few years ago, I wrote a question to Amazon about this and they gave me an answer that was not what I was looking for. I was told that I was "not the target audience" (the people to whom this CD, if you buy it, is aimed at). Some people I know have purchased it, and they love it.
I wrote to Amazon and asked them to confirm that they were saying that, and I was told that they are not.
Now, I know they are not saying that. They are just not saying that. 
So, if you want to find out for yourself, I suggest you do some digging into the matter. I have asked them numerous times to reply to my emails, and so far, they have not. 
I just recently asked them how long it took them to respond to my question, and they told me they are getting a lot of emails every day. So, I will have to wait to see what they say.
This is a great question, and I hope that Amazon will answer it, because it is not just about this CD, and I am very curious to know how the people who are buying it feel about it. I hope that it will be a great CD, because I would love the opportunity to hear her live. 
P.S. I forgot to link to the Amazon music store, so I just used the Amazon link on this page.

I know this is an old question, but I got your email address. I am a big fan of this song and the artist, and would love to hear her live. I searched for and found this CD in your store. So, I would love to know more about this and how you got the CD, as well as where you got it.
I would also be interested in hearing what other people think about it. I am not sure if I am the target audience, but I am very interested.

"So Hott"

by J. P. F.

"So Hott" is another great album from AFI's and a good one at that. If you like 90s alternative rock music you should definitely check this out.
The entire album is great, but I love the hidden tracks that I find on the CD that are not on the website. The songs "Cherry Bomb" and "Dangerous" sound pretty good, and I don't know why they are not available on the website.
I recommend "So Hott" to anyone who likes alternative rock music.

Amazon review: A good product, but not for me. I was very surprised to see how high quality this CD case is. It is very thick and the plastic is very sturdy. The CD's are still protected when in the case. The only thing I would like to change is a little more padding on the inside of the cover (like a little more padding around the edges of the case) and maybe a little more protection for the CD. Otherwise, a very good product.

Great sound

This is my favorite CD case, no joke. I have over 40 CD's and this case fits them all perfectly. I don't see why anyone wouldn't buy this case. It is so nice and thick and gives me peace of mind to know that my music is going to be safe and sound.

This is the only CD case that I have purchased that comes with a protective sleeve for the CD. It's not cheap ($40), but I think it's worth it.

Overall Rating:

5out of5

Pros

I love the way I can fit all my CDs in this case.

Cons

There is only one negative, it is very hard to get the CD's out when you put it in the case.

Sunglasses

I bought these sunglasses to use as sunscreens for my husband. They are very light and give good coverage. I just wish they came in a different color. I would have given this product five stars if they had come in a different color.

My husband loves them. He wears them to work and he loves the way they look.

Great product

I love this case. It fits my CDs perfectly. It protects them and looks great. If you are looking for a case that protects all your CDs and makes them look awesome then this is the one.

Pros

Perfect fit. Perfect protection. Great looking case of metal. Very easy to clean case.

Cons

None that I can think of.

Lightweight and Easy to clean

I have about 30 cd's and this case is perfect for me. The case is very light and folds up very small. I can carry it in my backpack with all of my music in it. I would recommend this product for anyone who loves to listen to music and can carry it in their backpack.

Pros

Perfect fit. Perfect protection. Great looking metal case. Easy to clean case.

Cons

None that I can think off.

Very cute

I bought this case to hold my vinyl copies of my songs. I use it so often that it is the first thing I think of when I am trying to find something to put in my backpack. It is very cute.

Pros

This is the first thing I think of when I want to grab a case to hold my music. It is very cute.

Cons

None that I can think of.
I am not sure if it is worth it.

Great price

This case is very nice and protects my cd's very well. I think the price is fantastic. You get what you pay for.

Pros

This is the best rock cd I have ever heard. I know that there are many other cd's that are better than this one, but I really like this cd, so I am giving it a full 5 stars. I am a huge fan of Mj and have been since the first time I heard him. For years he has been my favorite artist and I have been listening to all his cd's for years and years. At first I liked this cd but after a few listens it got really old.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: Wow. a Christmas album featuring a Rhodes!?  I love Rhodes pianos and have one in my living room, so I was elated to see this CD.  But it's not played on a Rhodes.  It sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard, complete with cheezy drum track.  It's definitely not played on any model of a real Rhodes piano.  What a disappointment.  All the songs are very stiff, as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live.  I'd love to know where they came up with the "at the Rhodes piano" for the title.

Amazon review: This was a gift from a friend and was really pleased with it.  I listened to the CD and found it to be excellent.  The songs were well written, the songs were great.  I just wish there was a little more variety.  There seems to be a lot of songs that feature the same type of music.  I also wish there was some variety in the lyrics, but I don't think this comes from a lack of effort on the part of the author.  It's really a shame that the author doesn't realize that people actually listen to the lyrics.  This is not a work of genius.  It has some good ideas and some good feelings, but it's not a perfect album.

It is about a boy who was taken from his home town.  He had a good life until he was taken by a kidnapper and the story sounds like it was written by a mother who was just as scared as the boy.  The book is about a boy who is being taken back and the song is about a boy who is being brought to a new place.  The song is about a boy who is being brought home.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I don't know what to say about this album,  Its good,  Not that good.  I like a lot of the songs on the album,  I don't think the lyrics are to your taste.  But the album is very good.  It reminds me of when I was in high school and the music that was playing on the radio was just a few years old.  I love that its the best of the album and only the top 3 songs on the album are new.  If I was to list the 10 best songs on the album, I would put it at number 3.  I hope the album sells well and they make more albums like this.

I don't want to sound like a jerk, but it's been a while since I listened to any of the artists,  But I liked the song "The Right Side of Love."  Other songs on the album are pretty good,  "I'll Be Waiting"  and "Love Will Never Pass Me By."  Other songs on the album are great,  "Last Night"  and "You'll Never Find Another Man Like Me."  This album does not have a bad song, but it has a couple of not-so-great songs on it.  I would give it 3.5 out of 5 stars, but the songs are really good.

Amazon review: My wife and I bought the CD while on a road trip from Austin to Nashville. It was in a small car with the windows down playing music, and it sounded great. Since then, we've listened to it almost non-stop on the road. I've been listening to it on the road since I bought it. We'd listen to it if we were on a plane, bus, and train (and probably while driving). It's a great song. I like the fact that the song is so close to the actual event. We listened to it several times while driving and listening to music. I liked the way it sounded and the lyrics. It would be great for a road trip.

Review: For the first time in a long time, I have been able to find Billy's new album. After years of searching, I finally found this great new album by Billy Currington. I have listened to about 20% of it so far. This is a great album. I am amazed at how good it is! I have only heard a few songs and have not listened to them all, but I can tell that Billy is a very talented artist. I am anxious to hear more.

Amazon review: yo redman has always been one of my favorites. his first three albums are off the chart. but this album sounds like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop. what a bad album. ive waited this long for this. i don't know if reggie will ever get back his great sound. he needs a producer, some one to make dope beats. this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these days like it. im sad i was so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: I'm going to say that this is a decent album, but that's about it. I've heard more from this album, I'm not sure where the time went. This album is not as good as the previous, but that is not saying anything bad, this album is not bad. As for the vocals, I find the vocals to be just as good as the previous album. I would give this album an 8.5, but only if you want some good songs, I do not.

Amazon review:
I am disappointed with this CD. It takes a very long time to get a nice CD, and I can't always find it.
I am not a fan of this artist, and I never have been, but I have heard a lot of great stuff by many different groups and her CD is not one of them. The only songs I like are the ones she sang in the song "Just One Of Those Things", and "I'm a Man", and in the song "My Favorite Things". The rest of her CD is awful. Her voice is not the best, and her singing is not the best, and her lyrics are not the best. Her voice is not the best. Her vocals are not the best. Her vocals are not the best.

I listen to a lot of good music, but this CD is not one of them. There is an artist who can be compared to someone who I enjoy listening to a lot, and some people say that I don't really like her music. I like her music, and I think that I should be allowed to listen to her music. But, I don't really like her music and I have to say that is not a good reason.
