Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!

Amazon review: The first line gives the whole song a whole new dimension.  This is the only song on this album that sounds like it came from a soul man.  I love the way the lyrics are done.  It reminds me of the old Motown songs that have been remade today.  Every line is sung with so much emotion, and it has a special impact on my heart.  I will be buying this album.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of John Prine for a long time.  I have heard this song on a few compilations, and it is one of his best.  The song brings tears to my eyes.  I love the way he sings it.  I love the way he describes the song, I love the way he sings the lyrics.  I love how he puts his heart into the lyrics.  I love his ability to take the listener on a journey with him.  I love the way he can take all of his pain and turn it into a song.  I love him for standing up for what he believes in.  He knows how to write a song and how to sing it.

Amazon review: This song takes me back to my youth, and it brings back so many memories.  I remember how the song "If It Wasn't For The Two Of Us" (from the movie "Footloose") made me feel, and I remember how it made me smile when I listened to it on the radio.  I remember when Paul Simon sang this song in the movie "The Greatest Story Ever Told" the first time I saw it.  I remember how the song "All I Want For Christmas Is You" made me feel because of the way it made me feel.  I remember when the song "It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" made me feel.  I remember being on the plane flying from New York to New Orleans and listening to the song "All I Want For Christmas Is You."  I remember when I was driving, listening to the song "All I Want For Christmas Is You."  This song brought me back to my youth, and it made me feel.  I remember when I was in high school, hearing this song on the radio and I remember being in college, listening to this song and thinking that song was perfect for me.  This song has always brought me back to my youth.  I love the way he sings it.

Amazon review: I wish I could give this a 5 star review. I have seen Richie play live and I have heard him on the radio but there is no telling how good he is until I see him in person. I also purchased this CD because I was so excited to hear Richie. You can tell that Richie is a very passionate musician and a very talented singer. I was very impressed when I first heard him sing on Howard, but I was less impressed when I heard him live. I felt that he was a bit overly polished and that he sounded too similar to Michael Jackson. I don't think he sounded like Richie because he is a very good singer. I do think that Richie was a little too much into his stage act. It was more like a rock and roll version of his singing style rather than a full on performance. I was a bit dissapointed when I first heard him live. But I was really surprised when I heard him on Howard. He sounded very good. I think that he is still one of the best live performers in the country. He also sounded good when he and I listened to him on the radio. I know that Richie is a multi-talented singer, but I was a little dissapointed with this CD. I think that it is a bit gimmicky. He is very talented and it is good to have him on my CD collection. more than once.

Amazon review: Richie is better live than on the radio. I have seen him perform several times and at one of my concerts he played the entire concert using only his saxophone and a microphone. I have also seen him on the radio. His music is very popular and if I had to choose one I would give it to Richie. He is one of the very best live performers in the country.

I have heard great singers like Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Simone, Ella Collins, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald and many more but I have not heard one saxophonist who can be compared to Richie. His saxophone is a different type of saxophone. He is a great singer and a great artist. I am glad to have this album in my CD collection. more than once.

I have heard him sing on Howard but I was not impressed because I thought that he sounded too much like Michael Jackson.

Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible.

You provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song. unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that I wanted to buy, from the same band doing the same song, only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it! Wasted my money on something I didn't even want because you can't provide a sample clip more than 20 seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful!

Amazon review: This was a great song, but I was hoping for "Love Hurts", which was the closing song on the CD.  The sample did not match, so I had to go through the whole song again.  This time the sample did match and the original recording is awesome.  The original recording of "Love Hurts" is on a different CD from this CD.  I would have been happy with just that song, but I had to hear the one I wanted.  After I got the song I couldn't believe it because it was way better than I had hoped for.  (I also wanted "Love Hurts" on the CD, but it wouldn't fit)  I had no idea any of this would happen until I got the sample and the CD, and then I had to listen to the CD to know it was the original.  I also purchased the CD, and it is the same song as on the other CD.  So, if you want "Love Hurts" don't bother with this CD.  It's not the original & I was hoping for a different song.  I'm not a big fan of Cher, but I still wanted to buy this CD because I LOVE her voice.  I did not want to settle for a song I didn't like.  I would like to hear the song I bought, and I will.  What's worse is that the song I bought has a sample of the song on the other CD, which you didn't tell me about until after I bought the CD.  I'm sure you were going to throw in the CD before I bought it, and I'm sure you were going to do it right after I bought it, but you didn't.  I had to listen to the track on the CD to know it was the original & not the one on the other CD, and I'm sure you would have wanted me to buy the original CD, but I couldn't find it in my CD player.  It's like I'm playing the CD backwards.  I have to listen to it the way I bought it, to know it's the original.  I've had several bad experiences with Amazon.  This is one of them.  I'll never buy anything there again.  I will tell everyone I know about it so that they can avoid buying anything from this seller.  I'm sure they'll have to find a new life because of the negative reviews on this site.  I thought they were good people until they ruined my experience.

Amazon review: I bought this album on a whim and listened to it, but was disappointed to know I was buying the original recording of the song.  I had to listen to the song a few more times to find the exact version I wanted.  I have bought many CDs from you over the years, but this is the first time I have had problems with Amazon.  I wanted the CD that had the best version of the song, but I could not be sure it was exactly the same as the original recording.  I have no trouble finding the original version of the song on other CDs, and I will have no trouble buying another CD from you.  Why do you have to mix up the songs on your CDs for me?  It must be very difficult for you to do this, but it is difficult for me.  I am not a big fan of you, but I still wanted the exact song that I really wanted.  I can't believe I wasted my time and money because of some mix up on your CDs.  I should have just bought the best song on the CD and was happy.  I am so disappointed that this happened.  Why can't you have the exact song on the CD you have already given me?  If I had known the problem, I would have not purchased the CD from you.  I am now going through your whole CD's in my car to find the version of the song I wanted.  I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have ruined my experience with you.  I would rather go through the CD's in my car to find the song I want than go through the whole CD looking for a song that I know you mixed up.  It is a lot of work to search for the exact same song twice.  I don't want to find the version of the song that is on the CD that comes with the sample, because I know I will not like it.  I will probably buy the CD I already have instead of wasting my time and money.  I will tell all my friends about this experience too.  I am so disappointed in you and your company.  I will never buy anything from your company again.  I would rather pay full retail price for the CD that has the exact version of the song on it than waste my time and money on finding

One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

They are the best of friends, and they have a lot of songs about that friendship.

It's the best album of 2012, in my opinion. I have never heard anything like this before, and I am not sure how anyone can argue against this album. I was listening to a lot of hip-hop and rap in 2012, and I cannot pick out a single album that makes me feel like I got it all, the way I got it on this album.

But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review:  I love this song. When my son was little, this was the first music he played and listened to. I've never had a single negative thing to say about this album. This is a great album that shows that you don't need to be a "great artist" to make good music. If you want to have a great career, you need to be great at what you do. This album shows that the music industry is not as bad as people make it out to be.

Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.
