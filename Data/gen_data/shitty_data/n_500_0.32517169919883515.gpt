Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I would recommend finding a different version to download.  I absolutely love this song, it has good sound quality, BUT they cut off the entire last word/note!  It drives me crazy and really ruins the track.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: First off, the song is not "cute."   It is not "cute" in the sense that it is "cute."  It is "cute" in the sense that it is a bit kinky and has a naughty tone to it.  It is "cute" in the sense that it has a good sound quality.  It is "cute" in the sense that it has good lyrics.   It is "cute" in the sense that the song is one that is not going away.   It is "cute" in the sense that it is a fun song.   It is "cute" in the sense that it's not for everyone.   It is "cute" in the sense that the chorus is not annoying.   It is "cute" in the sense that the instrumental is quite good.   It is "cute" in the sense that the guitar solo is catchy.   It is "cute" in the sense that the beat is good.   It is "cute" in the sense that it has a great overall sound quality.   It is "cute" in the sense that the sound quality is good.   It is "cute" in the sense it is a fun song.   It is "cute" for the fact that it is not for everyone.

Amazon review: This album is just a nice old fashioned country album that I have been looking forward to for a long time.  What I am saying is that I really enjoyed it.  I have been trying to get my hands on a copy for a very long time.  I have tried to download from several places but I keep getting the same message that I cannot download it.  I really liked this album.  I like all of the songs.  My favorite song is "The Ballad of the Broken Doll."

Amazon review: An old-timey country-rock album that is full of great instrumentation, songs that are written and sung with great emotion, and a story that is told in a way that will always give you a chuckle, and you will be looking for more.   I am not sure why this album got me so excited, but I enjoyed it.  It is a country album that is played in a way that doesn't take away from the music.  It is a real country album that is played in a way that is more than country.  It is a really good country album that is played in a style that I love.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

I can't believe that this is the first review I've ever written for this site. I've listened to this album over and over again over the last two weeks, and I just can't stop thinking about it. The album is outstanding. I've purchased several of the songs from Amazon, but I've chosen this album because it is so damn good. The album is the best release of their I've ever heard. I have to say though, that the songs weren't all the same on this album as the originals. I prefer the original songs, but I like where this album takes them. There are some great songs on this album. I'm probably not going to bother with the original artists. The music is beautiful, and it doesn't take itself seriously. The songs are memorable and you can't help but feel for the people on the album. The lyrics I could understand better. If you're looking for a great, but still different album, this is it. This is definitely a five star album, and I hope that you'll consider buying it. I think it's a great release. This is the kind of album that I wish that I could do a two part review of. The first part is the album, and the second is the review.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review: SO shocked that this album is rated so highly here.  Been a Slipknot fan since the beginning.  All Hope is Gone wasn't there best by any means but I still liked it to some degree. But this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion.  It's like a totally different band with Corey still doing vocals.  Most CD's grow on ya as time goes. But after months of trying I just can't say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clips in a song or two.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I'm not a huge fan of the Slipknot live shows, but this is a different vibe live, so I was excited to hear this album.  I never heard of this band.  They weren't even on my radar, so I was really pleasantly surprised.  The album started off with a really good guitar riff, then went into some really solid songs.  "The Devil in I" was my favorite song.  The song was so catchy and fun.  "Slipknot" was a good song, but I didn't like it, it wasn't my favorite.  "The Subhumans" was the most fun.  But "The Devil in I" and "Slipknot" were definitely the best songs on the album.  I loved how they all fit together.  This album is very well done and had a really good kick off.  I have many good songs from this album and will be buying more CDs from this band in the future.

Amazon review: This is a really good CD and has a great sound.  It's pretty much just the same as a good CD would sound.  The vocals are nice and the guitars aren't overused, the only thing that was a little annoying was the fact that the guitar part at the end of the song was overused.

Amazon review: I loved this CD that was on the radio at the time and I was looking forward to hearing it.  I've heard a few things about this band and I'm super excited.

Definitely a positive review with my expectations being high.

Amazon review: This album is pretty much a compilation of songs from their previous releases.  The songs sound the same, but this album is a little better than some of their other albums.  The sound is great.  The lyrics are great.  The vocals are nice and the guitar riffs are great, but the songs are about the same.  The only thing I don't really like is the guitar riffs at the end of the songs.  They are a little overused.  I really like the music on this CD, but I think that it's time for the band to get back on track and write more cohesive songs.

Amazon review: I was disappointed in this CD.  I had a lot of expectations for this CD, but it was completely different from what I expected.  I was expecting to hear some metal, but the vocals were really good.  The songs have great lyrics and are pretty catchy.  I just don't understand this CD.  I think that the band would improve if they wrote more cohesive songs.  I don't know if it's because they don't write or because they don't have enough songs.  This CD was just disappointing.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I couldn't wait for Bruno to drop his new album. I love his style. I grew up listening to different genres of music. my mom was R&B. dad loved funk/soul and all true 80s babies should love new jack swing. He was able to incorporate all of it on 1 album. hands down a masterpiece. Whole album on repeat.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

Amazon review: I hate to admit it but I really did love this album. I think it was one of Bruno Mars's best albums and his voice is amazing.

###
Amazon review: I have never been a fan of Bruno Mars. Never. I thought he was great on the original "Just the Way You Are." I thought he was a good rapper, but I thought he was never really a singer or anything. He can sing, but you can't really call it singing. You have to hear it live. His voice is great, but his songs are not even close to being good. They sound like they were recorded in a studio, with some cheesy musicians, and a few other people who don't know what they are doing. And I am not even giving him credit for being a good rapper. He just raps and raps. And he has a nice voice, I guess. He is a nice guy, and he does have a nice voice, but I have never been a fan of his music. I think he is great on the original "Just the Way You Are." He has a nice voice, and it is hard to deny the originality of the song. I thought he was a great addition to the new jack swing sound, but I thought "Just the Way You Are" was a great song and he was a great addition to the new jack swing sound. I thought it was a great attempt to do a different, new jack swing style of music. But I also thought that "Just the Way You Are" was one of the best songs he had ever written. I thought the album was really good, I thought it was a good attempt to do a different, new jack swinging sound of music. But I also thought that the album was one of the worst albums he had ever made.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Great album! I don't know what you meant about the song sound like a '70s band, it's not bad, but you know, I'm old enough to remember when I was just starting to listen to music. Maybe the music was different back then than it is now. But the song sounds like the original. I don't know.

Great album! I don't know what you meant about the "album sound like a '70s band" comment.  I do know that the song sounds great.  I'm not sure that it is a "70s band"  It sounds like the original.  I didn't mean that.  I don't know what I was trying to say.  I just love it.  I'm glad you liked it.

Amazon review: Wouldn't be heartbroken if I lost the whole CD.  I seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand. With that goal in mind I listened to the whole album elsewhere. I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.  But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

###
Amazon review: I feel like this CD is all over the place.  I like all of the songs, but the lyrics are just so generic.  They're not anything that I can relate to.  I guess it is a bit of a challenge for a band to be able to write lyrics that really relate to people.  I don't know.  It's a little bit like listening to the same guitar chords over and over again.  Just because it's a different chord.  I don't know.  I just think there needs to be more variety on the lyrics of a band's CD.  I think this CD could have had a little more variety on the lyrics.  I do like the songs though.  I like that the lead singer is not the biggest singer on the band.  I like that the lead singer is a little bit of a wimp.  I like that the lead singer keeps his voice down while the other lead singer is doing it.  I like that there is a little bit of an off tempo feel to the band.  I like that it is a little bit different from Three Days Grace.  I like that the songs are a little different from Three Days Grace.  I like that the songs are a bit different from the other songs on the album.  I don't know.  I just don't think it is good.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I have to give this CD four stars.

I don't think it is a good song to listen to while I am at home.  It is too slow for me.  I like that the song is a bit of a downer and a little bit sad.  I like that the song is a bit

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Must have been real drunk when I accidentally purchased this.  Would never listen to it (and I tried).

Amazon review: I have never understood the hype about this record.  I mean, just try to listen to it.  It's all over the place.  I could probably tell you its songs were good, but I have never been one to find good music in soundbyte format.  I know, it's just a cheap plastic shell, but it's got some good songs on it.  However, I was listening to it on headphones so the highs and lows were a little muted  but I could hear it.  The songs were all good but the production values were a little rough and the sound was not as good as I would like.  There were some good songs on this record and they were the only ones I heard.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a great album, but for me, there is some disappointment.  I thought it was a great album when I first bought it in 1998, but since then I have listened to this album over and over and over and I have no real idea what the songs mean, or if they mean anything.  I don't like the lyrics and I don't like the song writing, the sound, the production, or the overall feel of the album.  I have never listened to a Jimi Hendrix album and I don't really know why I'm bothering to buy it.  Even the packaging is a little disappointing.  I thought the album would have a nice jacket with Hendrix and some lyrics and a picture of him.  Instead it's a boring old sleeve with no pictures or lyrics.  I think it's a terrible album and I don't want to listen to it anymore, even though I purchased it the first time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very, very disappointing.  I didn't like the songs on this album, but I did like the packaging.  It was pretty and it was nice to have a record with all the songs in a nice plastic sleeve.  It also had some nice pictures on it.  The sound on this album is very, very poor.  It sounds like it was recorded in a garage in the 1970's or something.  It doesn't sound very good and it's very fuzzy, but at least it has some good songs on it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: Very interesting.  The album is very good but the packaging is ugly.

Amazon review: I liked the first album, I liked the second album, I liked the third album, and now, I have this.  I have listened to it a few times.  The songs on this album are better than the songs on the second album.  The production is not that great on this album.  The sound quality is not that great either.  But the songs are very good.  Also, the record is packaged like a nice album, with a nice picture of Jimi on the front.  I don't understand why all of these records seem to be wrapped in brown paper with a plastic sleeve.  I would like a nice picture cover with the record inside.  The only reason I bought this album was that I was looking for a Jimi Hendrix album.  It turned out to be better than I though.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I'm not sure what to believe.  I like it and I like the cover, but what is the point?  It's just a re-recorded version of one of his albums from around 1970.  I don't know if I'll purchase this one.  I don't really like Hendrix so I doubt I'll find something new to like.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the second Hendrix album to have been released in the last two years.  This was a great album.  It is better than the first album and it has much better songs.  The sound quality is much better and the production is also much better.  I would say that this is one of the best Jimi Hendrix albums ever.  It is a great album of Hendrix and you don't have to be a Hendrix fan to listen to this one.  I only really like the cover of this album.  I don't know why Hendrix chose this cover.  This album has a picture of a guitar on it and it's a lot like a guitar cover.  I thought it was pretty and it was a nice cover.  But the songs are a little short and I think that the songs are way too short.  So, I don't think I will buy it.  I don't even know if I want to listen to it.  I'm not a Hendrix fan and I don't like this cover very much.  It looks like it was made by a child and I
