"Breaking Bad"

I haven't been listening to music since I was about 11 years old. I don't plan to start again anytime soon, but I'll take a listen when I find time, and if it's good, I'll buy it.

"Breaking Bad" is the last CD on which I listened to music. It was the best. The songs were great, the performances were great, and the album is great. This CD was a great musical experience.

“I just hope that there is someone out there that can make me feel better about myself, before it’s too late.”

I was never a big fan of the TV show "Breaking Bad." I liked the main character, Saul, but I never really liked the show. I don't like the main character or the show.

When I first heard the album I was very excited. I was looking forward to listening to this CD.

I was surprised and happy when I heard the second song. I like the opening.

I have a lot of favorite songs from this album but I have to say "I Don't Like You" is one of them. I really like this song.

I really liked the album. I would recommend everyone to buy this album.

This album is great. I like all the songs on this album.

“I don’t know how to describe it, but I feel like everything is falling all around me

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: I've been a big BOC fan since the 1970s, and have gotten most of their albums along the way, but IMAGINOS was one that got away from me. I've seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I think it is a wonderful album as the songs are not repetitive nor are they overly repetitive.

I am a music aficionado, so I wanted to give the artist a chance before I bought their CD. I have to say that I have to agree with the other reviewer, this is a very nice recording. If you like jazz, you are in luck! This, along with the other works by Prince, is what I consider "the best of" Prince. The quality is excellent and Prince is able to put his own spin on the songs. The CD is easy to listen to and very interesting. I would recommend this CD.

I absolutely love this CD. It is a very well developed piece of work. Prince is a very talented musician and uses this album to express his artistry.

I think the CD is great for the price, it is a great addition to any collection.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: This is a rare find, as it is the only album that is recorded by two famous German singers.  And of the two singers, the one who is better is Brigitte Fassbinder.

The album is beautiful and has a great soulful sound to it.

Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I have been an avid fan of the Americana music genre since the mid 90's and have seen a lot of bands get on and off the bandwagon of the Americana genre.  There were a few that did hit the mark, but none of them stood out to me.  To me, this song is a great start. It is not a perfect song, but it has a sound to it that is appealing to me.  The song has a good beat, the vocals are great and there are some nice harmony vocals.  I do have one concern, the song's chorus is very repetitive.  Would it help a song if the chorus was put on its own track so that the vocals are not cut in?  The song is a great start, but it does need a few tweaks. Otherwise, I am giving this a 1 star rating.

Amazon review: A little while ago I was browsing through the band's discography, and I came across this song by the band called "The Red and the Black" on their album "Ace of Hearts."  I wasn't that familiar with the band at the time, but I was familiar with the song.  I just loved it.  So when I came across this song on their album I was curious as to the singer's voice, I thought it could have been a little bit softer and a little bit softer with the chorus.  But after listening to the song on repeat, I found it to be one of the most unique songs I have ever heard.  The song is so simple yet it packs a real punch.  The vocals are really great, but they are not what you would call "good."  It's a combination of both great and bad.  The vocals are deep and the voice is well suited to the song, but there is so much of it that it doesn't make the song sound the way it is meant to be.  The song is a definite 5 star.  Great song.  Great voice.

Amazon review: I was listening to this song and I was thinking to myself, "why did I go and buy this CD when I didn't even know this song existed?"  The song is so bad.  I mean, it has no melody, the vocals are all screwed up and the lyrics make no sense at all.  Even after I put some money into my CD player and listened to it again, I still couldn't listen anymore.  How could this song be considered good?  I have had a lot of albums in my life and I have never once heard a song like this.  There is a good song here, but it is not this song.  I am giving this 3 stars because I didn't know this song existed until I listened to it.  I will give it another chance when I am at the local record store to rent it.  This is my first time listening to this song and I am not sure if I will ever like it.  The song is terrible.

Amazon review: This song was actually written in 1994, after a long period of the band's career not getting any airplay.  This song was written by Bryan Gee and Scott Shiflett.  I was aware of the band, but I didn't know any of the members personally.  I remember being in my car driving to the store with some friends and as we listened to this song we all thought of the same thing "the lyrics are so bad."  After this song was released it became a chart-topping hit and it now has a million times more views on YouTube than the original.  The song is called "One Way Ticket" and the chorus is just horrible.  The vocals are so bad and the lyrics are so bad.  The song is just terrible and I am giving it a 2 star rating.  I will listen to it again someday, but not now.

Amazon review: This is a very nice CD.  But, if you're going to buy this CD, you don't want to buy it because you think it's going to be good.  It's not.  I'm one of those people who likes to hear what a singer can do with a song after it's been recorded.  I like to hear what a singer can do to a song after they record it, and I like to compare a singer's live performance with their recording because the live performance is a better representation of what they can do.  With this CD, it's like, "That's nice, but it's not what I like about this CD.  I thought I liked what I heard on this CD, but I don't."  I don't have this CD because I don't like what I hear, so to me, it's not a CD I will listen to again.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  I love the song "I Can't Help Falling In Love".  It is one of those songs that just speaks to me and makes me feel so incredibly special.  It makes me feel like I belong somewhere, that there is a place inside of me that just belongs to me.  I wish that I could have it every day of my life.  I wish that I could give it to someone, and that that person would be so grateful for the gift that they would give me the most important gift that they can give anyone - and that is love.  I want to be loved so much that I will want to give people the most precious gift I can give for free - my time.

Amazon review: Dr. Octagon paramedic fetus of the East with priests, I'm from the Church of the Operating Room. With the strike support scalpels since the holocaust, I do indeed in greed explore meet the patients. Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse. Holding up office lights standing at huge heights. Back and forth, left wing, swing to North, East and South with blood pouring down your mouth. I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope, listen to your heartbeat, delete beep beep BEEP!

Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

For me this is a great movie, but a terrible song.  I don't know how I could have enjoyed it if I didn't know the song.

Amazon review: The Drifters are typical of many groups of the era, with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members. Lots of lawsuits usually resulted.

Amazon review: This is not a good song.  It actually makes me want to vomit.  The music is extremely loud and I can't hear myself think. The lyrics are repetitive.  The voice is irritating.  The message is not very inspiring.  Too much of a message.  Too little of an experience.  The music is so loud that I'm not sure if the song is even supposed to be played loudly.  The message is too preachy and repetitive.  In the end, I can really only guess as to what the message is trying to say, but the message could have been better.  I am not a man who likes to be told what to do.  The message is not very inspiring.  Too much of a "yes, and" message.  Too little of an experience.  It's not good.  It's not bad.  It's not great.  But it's not good and it's not bad either.  It just doesn't do it for me.  It's not worth the money.  I'm sorry, but I refuse to buy it.  It's not worth my money.  I don't recommend it!

I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy!

Amazon review: I have purchased both installments of the movies, but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the Mayles Brothers. This Audio encounter is not by the Mayles, and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties. The producers for the Cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck. The tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.
