Amazon review: I like the Echo and it’s super cool. I love how it’s voice works. It’s like talking to someone who is right beside you. I have a bad habit of saying “Alexa” instead of “Hey Alexa”, which makes the voice sound weird and so I try to change my voice to “Hey Alexa” so it’s like “Hey Alexa” or whatever. The first time I heard Alexa I thought it was my mom talking and I started giggling because I had thought my mom was dead. She was super cool and she said “Hey Alexa” and it sounded really cool and it made me go back to my normal voice.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I liked both of the singles, Undead and No. 5, that came out a while back.  I threw this CD into my order to get free shipping.  Based on the singles, which were decent rap metal, I was expecting a rap metal CD.  But this CD actually has 12 white boy gangsta rap tracks and 2 rap metal tracks.  Huge disappointment and totally not what I was expecting.  The CD also contains songs dedicated to "California" and "LA," talk about cliche.  I think it's fitting that the re-release of this CD is called Desperate Measures (to make money.

Amazon review: This was actually a fun listen to.  The band was very funky and had some great grooves.  The lyrics were decent, with some good raps.  The song "Shots" was good.  "Razor's Razor" was not.  The second song, "My Love" was awesome.  I don't know what happened to the first track, but I didn't like the second, "No. 5."  The album was fun.  The only song I really didn't like was "Never Cared Before," I just felt like there was no energy, and the guitar was a little weak.  I would recommend it for the fun factor, but I wouldn't put it in my collection.

Amazon review: The first song was good, the second song was not.  The second song was okay, but the first one was awesome and the second was lame.  The third song was good, but the fourth song was just a little boring.  The rest of the songs were mediocre, I would not play this CD in my collection.

Amazon review (from a reviewer): This is an excellent CD.  The first song, Razor's Razor, is an awesome song, and I was shocked when I heard that this album was being re-released. I was expecting a rap-metal CD, and I would have been disappointed with this one. I wish the band would concentrate on the rap-metal part of their sound.  I would have liked to hear a more original song, but the songs that are original are either too short or have a weak beat.  "My Love" is an awesome rap-metal song, but it is more reminiscent of a reggae song than a rap metal song.  The album is a great CD.  There is just one weak song, "Never Cared Before."

Amazon review: This is a great album.  The songs are extremely short (compared to the last album, which is probably the reason why the CD is re-released), and the songs are very good, but unfortunately, the songs are too short and the tracks are too fast, to be considered rap-metal.  The songs are very good, but they are too short and fast.  I would have liked to have heard more rap-metal songs, and I don't know if the other songs are rap-metal, but they are not.  I would recommend this CD to serious fans of heavy metal, but it will not be of interest to the rap-metal fans.

Amazon reviewer: I'm not sure why this album is being re-released.  When this album first came out many years ago, there was a video on MTV called "The Last Rap-Metal Video," and most of the videos were terrible, but this one was good.

Amazon review: It's a great listen and I'm glad to hear that there are some great songs on this album, but I have to give kudos to the producers who chose a great song and then added some great songs to it.  For example, the first song is the beautiful "It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year", and it's followed by "Oh Come All Ye Faithful" and "All I Want For Christmas".  These three songs are great, with good melodies and great lyrics.  There are a few other songs that are not as good, but there are also some songs that are very good, and still a few that are not very good.  You can't take credit for the songs that came before - you cannot know how good they are without hearing them first.  All I want for Christmas, for example, is "Christmas Tree In The Attic", and "White Christmas".  Both will be on the new release.  I'm not sure how much of a difference this makes.  I do really like the old songs, so I'll keep my purchase.

It's also nice to hear the new song that is on the album now, "All I Want For Christmas", which is another great song that I think Josh will be singing for a long time to come.  When it comes to songs on an album, I always like to have something new on the album to take my mind off of the old ones.  I think this CD is a good one for that purpose.

Amazon review: This is the first album for Josh since he was in the hospital in February of 1998.  He has been on the road touring with his band for the past three years.  He has put together a collection of great Christmas songs, but I think the songs that are on this new album are not nearly as good as some of the other songs included on the CD.  The production is a little off, and I think Josh is doing a better job of getting his voice back than he was in the past.  I really like the songs that are on the CD and hope he will have a long career singing Christmas music.  I'm glad that Josh is still singing, even with all of his hardships.  This is an interesting CD....

Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

I have a best friend that is a total bitch, and I love her to death, but she is never at the house to hang out.  I have a sister who would be a great friend, once the dust settles, but she's on the phone all the time.  I haven't been invited to her house in over a year.  I have a niece that I try to include in my circle of friends, but she's so busy she won't have time.  I've been friends with three of my best friends since I moved here from the Midwest, and they have been close friends since we were babies.  They are my two best friends, and they are both sisters.  All three of my friends have moved away to college, but we still hang out and talk about girls and things.  I have no sisters.  I'm the only girl in my family.  I have a brother, and he is the one sibling that my friends get along with.  I love my brother.  His mom and dad are both really nice, and I know they are going to do the right thing and make sure he gets married, but they don't know him.  I want to go to college one day, and I see my brother and his friends all the time, but I don't see my best friend.  I'm going to college one day, too, and I want to do well in school, but I don't know if I'm going to be able to make friends like I want.  I want to hang out with my friends, but then I'm gone with my brother.  I don't have any sisters, and I feel like I don't really even have a best friend.

Amazon review: If you are looking for a good song to listen to, this is it.  Just because it is a cover doesn't mean it isn't a good song.  I can't think of anything negative to say about it.  The only criticism I would have is that I would like for the lyrics to be done in a different way so that they sound more like an original.  If I had to choose one, I would say that it would be a tie between "You're all I need" by James Taylor and "The Time of Our Lives" by the Supremes.  I just think the Supremes version is better, but that's just me.  The lyrics are all good, the song is good and it makes me want to listen to the rest of the album.  I would give this a positive review.

It's not really a long song, and it's a little choppy.  I like the lyrics though.  I don't know if they are accurate, but I like the way that the song goes along.  It's nice.

Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

I'm not a big Beatles fan, but I really enjoyed this album. I'm a big Beatles fan, but I don't remember ever listening to any of their albums more than once. I prefer their work in live performances.

I think this album is about as good as it gets. I haven't heard much of their work but there's always been a lot of Beatles fans here so I'll listen to anything they put out. I've listened to it several times.

I have listened to this album several times. I don't think I'll go any further in my collection. I'm not into rock music, but I will listen to any Beatles album that's worth listening to.

Comment:

This is one of the few Beatles albums I have not heard and I will not be listening to it again. It's not a bad album but I think they would have improved the song choice.

Comment:

This is a very nice album, as is most of the Beatles work. But this album is very disappointing, even in their best moments. It's like they wanted to be the Beatles, but they didn't have the talent or the musical ability to be the Beatles.

I am a big Beatles fan. I have listened to all of their albums several times. I would have to say this is one of the worst albums in the Beatles' catalog.

I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: OMG i have two copies of this album. too bad its still not on CD but its my  3rd favorite cher album. stars being my favorite. get your copy BEFORE its too late and it truly is more rare then it already is NOW. My favorite songs are Long distance love affair, (the only single) I'd rather believe in you, and It's A Cryin' Shame! I believe this album is HIGHLY underrated and deserves more credit!

Amazon review: This is my favorite album of theirs.  I love hearing them play live and I love their music.  I know they've been around for at least 30 years.  I don't believe I've ever heard them play anything that is this good.  The lyrics are the only thing I don't like about this album.  I just wish they would release a CD without their music.  I have a full set of their music on my iPod.  I listen to their music everyday and I just can't get enough of it.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I would give this CD 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that I've listened to a lot of Ry Cooder's work and have never been this impressed by his work.  This is a great CD and it has so many great songs.

The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.

Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.
