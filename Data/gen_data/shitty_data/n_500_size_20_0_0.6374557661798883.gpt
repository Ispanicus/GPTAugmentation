Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review: i very rarely bother to write a review, unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something. unfortunately this is the latter. i've always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak, materialistic, egotistical, club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 years now. though every album has had a different feel to it, i've always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.

This is a compilation of Ry Cooder's songs.  This means everything from the Ry Cooder catalog is on this CD.  This is a good compilation, and probably the best compilation in Ry Cooder's catalog.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: The recording is not good. The voice and the instruments don't have a good balance. I wish I could get the studio recording instead of this live one.  I think I made a mistake of choosing this version. His you tube music has better recording than this one.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review:  Just when I started to like this song, it just went downhill.  What, are you expecting me to go all the way back to the beginning now?  I don't think so.  I'm not going to be the guy that goes back to the beginning and says "Hey wait, I like this better."  And I'm not going to be the guy who says "I don't like this, but I think I'll give it a shot."  This is the end of the road for me.  Too bad because I really liked this song.  I had heard it on the radio, and liked it.  I think it's about a woman, but I'm not sure what the guy is singing about.  I'm not a fan of any of the men's voices in this song.  I don't know why it's even in the top 10.  It's not even in the top 30.  I'd have to listen to it 20 times to get it right.  I don't know if anyone would listen to this song if I did.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The singer is so boring.  The song is good, but it's not all that special.  I was waiting for the guy to sing "I need a hug."  He comes close with "But I don't need a hug," but it's not close enough to make it worth the wait.  I'm really disappointed with this song.  It made me want to take a shower.  I feel like I'm in a bad movie.  I can't think of anything to say.  I don't even know what genre this song is.  It just sounds like a bad version of "I Like to Move It."
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song was awful.  It was very annoying.  I couldn't even understand what the guy was saying.  Not worth listening to.

Amazon review: I think the problem with this song is that it has some weird lyrics but the music is fine.  It's not a good song at all.  I just don't know what to say.  I would like to hear a song that has a guy singing "Don't stop me now!"  Please.  I would love to hear that song.  Please.  I'm going to need it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I think I'm going to leave this review for Tim and to see if he gets back to me about the song I sent him.  I'm sorry if I didn't send it out.  It's not that I don't care.  It's just that I have to get to work.  Sorry about the review, Tim.  I just don't know what to say.  I don't understand why the guy singing the song is having trouble.  It's a silly song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I think it would be a better song to add a word or two to lyrics and maybe remove the chorus.  I'm not really sure what I'm trying to say.  I just don't understand why the guy is singing this song.  I don't think I'm singing it.  I don't really know what the point is.  It's just a song that I can't stand.

Amazon review: I love Bob Dylan and so I bought a Christmas CD thinking it would be in his unique style. I was very disappointed. His sound does not work with these songs. It's not enjoyable. The backup singers are bright and sound young and angelic, which contrasts nicely with Bob's throaty sound, but the choice of songs was wrong. Sorry Bob!

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I've gotten the DA version of this and I agree with everything you said.  The narration is fantastic, however the disc is too short for me.  I can't say I was blown away by the music or the lyrics.  However, I think the narration is very well done.

Amazon review: I'm not a fan of Christian music.  I'm not a fan of most music.  However, I do like this album and have purchased it several times.  I've had a CD player for over 30 years, and like new music.  I just can't get into this music.  I've tried listening to it by ear, and I've tried listening to the disc in a CD player, and I just can't get into the music.  The music is not the worst I've ever heard, but it's not my style or preference.  I'll listen to it once in a while, but I won't buy it or give it to my friends.  The disc is worth the price of the CD, but I don't think most people will dig it.  It's not a bad CD, but I don't think most people will get their money's worth.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: for the elevator or dentist's office.  I won't go into how much I loved their previous works and live shows so that I may justify my opinion here. but I was a big fan.  And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a hard time with music with female vocals.  I guess it is because I'm a woman.  I didn't like this song.  I thought the lyrics were weak and bland. I just didn't like the sounds of the male voices and the way it sounded.  I thought it would be much better if it had a male lead with female backup vocals.  I think it would have worked better.  I don't have a problem with the overall concept, but the song is just not memorable for me.  I think this CD is a waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I absolutely love this album. I have been a fan for quite some time. I love the lyrics, the music, the singing, and the message. I also think that this album is very unique and very well executed.  It is definitely a different vibe from anything else out there.  It is also just plain fun to listen to.  I especially like the songs "Don't Call Me Baby" and "What's Wrong with the World Now."  
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I started out as a fan of this band, but I have to admit that I like many, but not all, of their songs.  I thought this one was an enjoyable listen.  The lyrics are sweet and the music is great.  I also like the guitar solos on this one.  However, I do not like the way "Let's Get It On" ends.  I also think the ending of "Let's Get It On" is the kind of ending that should be left to the listener to decide.  I don't think it is very good for a live performance.  It just doesn't add up.  I also think that the ending is a little too cute.  I think it should have ended with a scream or a laugh.  This song is not that bad.

Amazon review: I love this song.  It has a very catchy melody and good lyrics.  I really like the guitar solo on the first chorus.  This song is very close to my heart. I think it is one of the songs that is very special to me.  It reminds me of the songs from their album, Newsboys, The Songs They Sang, and The Songs They Wrote.  I don't know what is going on.  I guess this guy is just a real genius.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Sometimes there are multiple versions of an album so I always listen to the samples.

This is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store.

Amazon reviewers' opinions:
"I have always been a fan of Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Eminem. They are three of my favorites, and I feel like Dre has taken the music genre and mixed it with his own unique style and signature. I was a little skeptical at first, but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. The production is top notch. This album has so many great songs.
I also really like the song "Hurt" by Nelly. It's a little controversial, but the best thing about it is the use of the beat in the song's chorus that is just as powerful and powerful as the beat is.
I'm glad that they brought back the original beat and song. I'm still waiting for the remix to come out.
Overall, this is a great album and I plan to buy it for myself and my friends to enjoy.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's. A great band for those of us who whated something besides those grunge bands.

Amazon review: The song is so great, that when I first heard it I was like "oh, this is an old song"  After a while I was surprised.  It's the perfect song for the end of a movie, when people are cheering and the credits roll.  I think this song is about a girl who loses her best friend to her boyfriend.  The song describes the sadness of the end of a relationship and how even though they're not together anymore, the memories of the time they spent together are still with them.  We're all a little sad sometimes.  This song is perfect for that.

Amazon review: Come On. It's Christmas. Really? Did she really have to make a vulgar song? She couldn't have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays?  It's the season of hope and joy, yet Lady Gaga is producing this.  I've never had a problem with her other work. Up until now that is.  And to top it all off, Amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion.
