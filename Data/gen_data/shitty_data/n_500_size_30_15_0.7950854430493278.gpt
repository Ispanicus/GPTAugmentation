If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

It has every type of style of Christian music I like. When it comes to prayer music, my favorite song is "Ignite My Fire" after that I like "One Pure and Holy Passion". It has two good praise songs too "Awesome" and "Good". My favorite worship related song is "Created to Worship". He also did a nice job on his remake song "Praise is What I Do".

Amazon review: I remember listening to this iconic song years ago. If I recall correctly, it was one of the tracks on a promotional "Best of Wild" CD that came free with an early Discman (my father's).

Amazon review: This is the worst expenditure I have ever made on a CD or tape.  The $14.95 was ill spent since all this CD had was a short 5 minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a separate CD as a part of a series.  It is evidently a recording of a meeting Ms. Ponder did and they broke it up into pieces and are selling each peace for the $14.95.  In my opinion, the whole series should have been put on one CD and sold for that price!  What a rip off!

Amazon review: I have not heard this song on the radio. I did however listen to it over and over and over again at the home of my friend, a Christian.  I have listened to this song at least 10 times without ever hearing the song on the radio.  I have heard it on the radio, maybe twice, and both times it was in the middle of a song that was playing.  I really like this song. It is very well written, and the lyrics are very beautiful.  The only thing I can think of not liking about this song is the lyrics.  The song is called, "God is Good."  As a Christian, I would not want God to punish us, but I would want God to let us know that he is good.  I could not help but think that the lyrics were a little over the top in that we are not supposed to "question" God's goodness because it is just that.  What I find interesting is that no matter what song I listen to, I never question God's goodness. I never question God's existence, I never question God's attributes, I never question God's justice, I never question God's love, I never question the Bible, or even God's sovereignty.  I never question God.  God is good, and I am content.  I feel the song is about a relationship with God, that God is good, and that we should be like him.  That is the only reason I could see why it is called "God is Good."  If I was to listen to this song, then I would have to question the good and the bad of God, but I would not question God.  I would have to question God for being good, but I would not question God for being bad.  I would not question God for loving me, but I would not question God for being unlovable.  I would not question God for being a God, but I would not question God for being a person.  I would not question God for being a father, but I would not question God for being a son.  I would not question God for being a parent, but I would not question God for being a father.  I would not question God for being a father, but I wouldn't question God for being an author, or an artist, or a writer, or a musician, or a writer, or an author, or an artist, or a musician, or a writer, or an author, or a musician, or a writer, or an artist, or a musician, or a writer, or anything.  I would not question God for being a parent, but I wouldn't question God for being a father.

Amazon review: Is this an April Fools Day joke?  I ask that because this was only released yesterday.  And man is it pretty sub par!  Vocals are simply awful here.  David Lee Roth was never a great singer, though he was a great frontman.  In the studio, and with songs that matched his vocal style, he could be pretty good.  So paired with a great sounding band (and that's why I give this album 2 stars) he sounds even worse because his lousy singing just stands out more.

Amazon review:  I would like to say to anyone reading this review that I've been listening to this CD since I was 13, and I've listened to it on and off since then.  I purchased it for my self & my son, and it is one of the best CDs that I've heard, and I've listened to other CDs since then, none of them have even come close to this CD for me...I feel like I've been in a time capsule listening to this album all these years.

Amazon review:  I would have to say this is by far the best CD that I have ever heard.  I have listened to every CD by REO Speedwagon from beginning to end, and this is by far the best album that I have ever heard.  My sister has been a fan of REO Speedwagon since they were just a bunch of guys out of Buffalo.  She was born in the mid 80's and has been a fan since then.  I do not remember her buying a CD until the latest one by REO Speedwagon.  I could not believe how good it sounded, and I have not listened to it since I got it.  I was very surprised when I did get it just to find out that it is a good album.  I would like to thank Mike D for making this CD.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: This is a really good compilation of oldies. I have a couple of CD's and they are all very good. I do have one song on one of them that is a little too upbeat for me. The "I Want A Little Girl" is better with a little more mellow background. But I do like the other songs.

Amazon review: My wife and I both have several of these. They are a great "I don't know" and "I don't care" song. We can't stop singing them!

Amazon review: "This is the first song I have ever heard that includes a drum solo."  I am a little bit surprised by that. I am a little bit surprised by this particular song because it is one of Beethoven's most recognizable pieces.  The percussion, however, is not what I would call the most recognizable part of the piece.  The violins are easily recognizable because they are so distinct.  The drums are a little harder to pick out as they are not distinct enough.  The song is very well written and I could see this song being played very well.  However, the recording does not give me the full scope of what these instruments sound like.  The recording is very dry and the sound is not clear.  It sounds like a drum solo.  The recording quality is not as good as the other items.

The song is so good and I love the backing vocals but I do not think the song is as good as the other songs on the CD.  It kind of reminds me of a more pop rock style of music but this is also a good rock song. I like the backing vocals but the sound quality is not the best.

The song is a great song, and although I don't know much about the band, I hope they become famous and get more recognition.

It also has some great instrumentals.  Although I do have to say that the vocals are a little on the soft side.  And I'm not convinced that the guitar solo is over-the-top cheesy in any way.  But that's just my opinion.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Love the song (MP3 download of "Some Good Years"), with excellent sound quality as well.  What a talented group, in the late 1960s/early 1970s, the 1990s (when this song came out), and even in the 2000s.

Amazon review: I've been a devoted fan of O'Hearn since the 80's and have all his music. I have always concurred with positive reviews & really hate to write this, but do so to prepare other fans- This is the least inspired of his works and the first I've regretted purchasing. I'd suggest listening to the tracks (on itunes, they're longer) before assuming you'll enjoy the entire collection. There are a couple of nice cuts (e.g. Playground), but there is a lot of redundancy, repeating percussion that's annoying and sounds dated, and generally very somber and lifeless songs.

Amazon review: As a radio show host I am looking daily at the charts. I found this in Amazon's top 10, and really love it. Only thing I would "and did change for airplay" is the ending, not into songs with acapella quiet endings. But currently for free, hard to beat this one:)

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of Jewel since her debut in the early '80s.  I have been disappointed in the quality of her new recordings, but it is hard to get a CD that sounds good in the first place.  I would have preferred to have a second, not a third, album.  But, with the price of most CD's it just isn't possible.  I have been a fan since her first album.  A long time ago.

###
Amazon review: I have only had this CD a few times, but I've always enjoyed it.  As a fan, I was not expecting much from the CD, but have to be honest, I have not really enjoyed it.  I think the production is fine, but I'm not sure it was a good choice for the CD.  
I think it could have been a lot better.  And then, there is that fact that Jewel's voice is getting worse!  Her voice sounds as if she has been drinking more and more, at least that's what I can tell from listening to the CD.  I am not sure if it was just me, but I really can't believe she sounded like that for a few songs!  For the most part, her voice was fine, but the songs were not as good as they used to be.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Great album.  The songs are all great.  But, after listening to the songs, I realized that I don't know how to pronounce the names.  At least the album was released in the UK, so I will take that into consideration.  I have heard that there are at least three different versions available.  Some are on the Internet, others are in the UK.  This is not a problem with the album, but I did have a problem with the album's cover art.  The album cover is quite good, I will take it as a compliment.

Amazon review: The band and the album are great.  It's amazing, I've been a fan since 1985.  I'm not sure if the band had a lot to do with the album's success, but I'm glad that they made it.  I'll never forget the first time I saw them play and I was hooked.  I knew then that I had to find Jewel a record deal, or else we may never see her again.  I'm hoping that this album will help her to get a deal.  All the songs are great.  They never get boring.  The best part about this album is that it actually has songs from all of their albums.  I can't wait to hear the new Jewel albums, so I'll be on the lookout for those.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I have to say that I have not really been a fan of Jewel's albums until she released the last one in late 2001.  I have always liked her albums, but I wanted to see what she had in store for us.  I am very glad that I finally got to experience her latest work.  I think this cd is good, I mean, I like everything that she does.  Her voice is amazing.  I think it's the best thing that she has done to date.  She really has not lost anything of her talent.  I really liked the songs on this one, they are all fantastic.  I was shocked that I could never get past the first 2 songs on this cd.  I can't help but think that I would have been happy if I had never bought this cd.  I will enjoy it, but it is sad to me that the cd did not have songs from all of her albums.  I am sorry to the Jewel fans out there, but I just can't see how she could have sold so many of these albums.  This is a great CD and I cannot imagine that it will not sell well.

Amazon review: When most folks think of the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th, I expect they recall the choral segment.  This 1 min., 23 sec. bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece.  That said, this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am very familiar with all of the performances in this collection; all are excellent, some are definitive. However, it's time Universal released the albums contained in the set separately, so one isn't forced to pay almost $40.00 just to get a performance of Bolero! They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like "Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967".  It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is the second disc in the CD box set of performances by the late Ernest Ansermet.  It contains a different selection from the first disc and is, by far, the best.  Ansermet was an extremely versatile musician, playing the piano, the violin, the cello and the flute, and there's very little the listener can't find here.  The playing is often of the high-quality that makes classical recordings of Ansermet's time, and the performances are well suited for listening to on headphones.  However, one can get a greater understanding of Ansermet's musical vision by listening to the recordings as he intended them to be heard.  I am most impressed with the way in which he played the solo violin part on the first disc.  The recording is rich in detail, and the recording quality is good, if nothing more.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am currently listening to this set in its entirety.  I can't say that I have a favorite or any other way to describe this collection.  I am just about done with it.  It's not a set that I can recommend highly enough.  There are a lot of great performances in this set, but this is probably my least favorite of all the disc.  The quality of the recordings is quite good, but I do have a few minor issues.  The first is that the recording quality is not the best.  Many recordings have a very grainy quality to them that, when coupled with the occasional distortion, create a very muddy sound.  This is not a problem with this disc I believe, but in the future it would be a good idea to have a recording engineer listen to the album and make sure everything is as it should be.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like this collection of music very much, a lot.  The problem is that they don't go deep into the musicians and their personalities.  For instance, I am very much aware that the piano playing on "The Piano Concerto No. 3" is not the best.  I would also like to hear the piano parts of the other concertos performed in the same way.  They don't do those kinds of things.  They just go to the piano and say, "You are the piano part.  I am the orchestra."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this set and the collection as a whole.  I guess the only reason I gave this set a negative rating is because of the fact that they did not include the complete Beethoven set.  To me that was one of the highlights of the collection.  It has a great sound and it is in one of my top 3 favorite classical collections.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I love this set of recordings from the late Ernest Ansermet.  He was an extremely versatile musician who was able to perform classical piano, violin, cello and flute. There is some great variety in this collection of recordings and I feel it has a lot to offer listeners.

###
Amazon review: I have only listened to this set once.  But I think it is a very good collection.  It would be a shame if there was no complete Beethoven set.  The sound is very good and the performances are unique.  I would be very interested to hear any recordings of the other concertos performed the same way.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This is a very good collection of recordings from the late Ernest Ansermet.  He was one of the best known pianist of his time.  He played the piano, the violin, the cello and the flute.  This is one of the best collections of Beethoven's music I have ever heard.

Amazon review: As a long-time fan, I was hoping for another offering of Jewel's unique folk-rock mix.  This is simply not the case.  It's dance music; it's difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire CD.  Does Jewel even know how to play guitar anymore, or did that riding accident damage her mind as well as her shoulder?!?!  I was hoping for a'secret song' or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song, but no.  If you're a fan of earlier Jewel CDs, don't bother.

Amazon review: If you know me I listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and (yes) even a few tunes now and then from Soundgarden ("Black Hole Sun" anybody?) and I LOVE some classic punk (The Clash are one of my favorite bands)but THIS! Okay for starters I remember when this record came out-I was still in the days of acid wash jeans,perms and U2 and stuff and along comes 'Nevermind'.What do I LIKE about this album?Well I LOVE the album cover-it's one of my favorites and it makes a great anti  establishment statement.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I like the new Jewel album because she is an excellent performer... but I love this song much more.  I think it's one of the prettiest songs she has ever recorded.  I have no idea why this song is on the album though, it's a bit too much for me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've been really into Jewel for a long time and I'm an avid fan of her music.  I was disappointed in this album, but not so much with this song.  It's my favorite song on the album and I've been listening to it on repeat since I received it in the mail.  It's a great song, but I wish it was a little better.  I'm not a fan of the lyrics, but I think she does a good job with them.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a total disappointment.  I love her music and the whole "I have no idea what the hell is going on at all" thing is cute, but it doesn't fit with the rest of the album.  She sings about being a total mess, but the rest of the album comes off as just a bunch of "meh" songs.  I can really only give this album a 5 out of 10.  It's not terrible, but it's not great either.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I like her style and I like her music.  However, I found her to be a little too much, but I'm not sure if that's because the lyrics are too simplistic or because the songs lack the diversity of other Jewel's.  The album has a lot of filler and is overall a bit bland.  If you like Jewel, than I suggest you give this album a listen and then try some of her other work.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is an okay album in my opinion.  It's not my favorite, but I still listen to it quite often.  I only wish that it was a bit longer.  I like all of her albums, but this one was the only one that I've heard that didn't have me complaining to my friends about how long it was.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I've listened to this album a lot.  I love how she combines her singing and playing styles.  The title track is the only song that I like and it's got a great melody.  The rest of the songs are decent with the exception of the lead single, "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead."  I think people who don't like her music should give this a listen though.  The whole album is rather boring and is definitely not worth the price.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I have listened to the Jewel albums before and they are great.  This one is no different.  I love every single song on here.  I like the "Don't You Worry Child" song with the little children in the background singing along.  This is my favorite Jewel album of all time.  I don't really like the music, but I love the way she expresses herself on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is Jewel's only album that I have never bought.  I have listened to her albums since I was very young and I was always amazed at all that she could do with a guitar.  I don't understand why people would want this album.  I understand that it's not like the other albums that I have listened to but it's still not worth it.  I wouldn't pay full price for this album.  I don't like the lyrics and I don't like the music.

Amazon review: I guess I'm just not that into her music.  I know what she's doing with the music and I know that it's just a gimmick or something.  I couldn't care less about the music, but I do know that the music was good when I first heard it.  This album is not great, but I have listened to a lot of her albums and this is the worst.  It's really nothing special.  The only good thing about this album is the title track.  I really want this album to be a hit.

Amazon review: This is more of a consumer warning than a review.  Don't touch this CD. Firstly, there is no Tom Waits.  Apparently, the band played two gigs this night and Tom Waits joined them on the second.  This recording is of the first.  Nor is it a radio broadcast.  It is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium, probably to cassette.  And according to those who were there, it isn't the whole concert.  Perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it, did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting.
