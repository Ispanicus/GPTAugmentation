Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I was really hoping for another great album from Wilson. Her first two albums were great and I was excited to hear that she was going to be making more music. Unfortunately, this album is just average. Not bad by any means but just average. I'm bummed because I really liked "Lonesome Dove" and "Dirty" which is why I decided to purchase this album. The album is a little short for an album but I guess I had to buy this and go to the concert with it.

Amazon review: Yes, this is the fifth album by Wilson and it is the first one to go out on a major label and it is still going to be on the charts. You can tell that it is her music.

I am also a big fan of This Is What I Do fan but this one is a little bit different. I would rather have an album that is a little bit different from the norm.

I am also not a fan of this album and I will not be buying it. I mean it is an amazing album and I really liked it. It has a good quality but I don't like the songs.

I don't think this album is that great but I would still recommend it to anyone who likes songs that will make you feel happy and good.

I mean the album is not that great but I like the way the songs are written. And I like that they make their songs so they can be played in a variety of different different styles.

I also like that the songs are so good and they make it better and better. I like the song "Lover" because it makes me feel

This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: This is a very fun song, and it's also very original.  They have an excellent cover of "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" by The Kinks - one of the best covers ever, in my opinion.  It's not the best version they've ever done, but it's still a fun song.  Overall a really good song, and a good version.

Amazon review: This is an interesting song.  If you like this song you would probably like "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart" by The Shirelles, which is not as good, but still a good song.  I'm really not sure why they put this on the album.  It may be just a filler, but it doesn't really fit in the album.  It's not a good song, but it's not a bad song either.

Songs for my heart

by: James G. | 01/01/09

I have been a fan of the band for over 20 years now, and have listened to all their albums. The first two albums made me fall in love with the band and I have to listen to one of them at least once a week. I listen to their music on my way to work, on my way to the gym, and on my way home from work. They are a great band and have a song for everyone. They have had a lot of success, but they are not the first band I've liked. The music is very different, but the band is just as different as the music. The band's style and voice are very unique, and they write great music. The band is very talented, but the only thing I would change about them is that they should have a guitarist that could play a little harder. The band is very talented, but they need to find a guitarist that can play a little harder.
I love the songs "Love Songs" and "Let's Go" because they are very different from the other songs. I also love the song "I Wanna Rock", it means a lot to me because I am a fan of rock music. The band has a different style from the other bands I have listened to. I love the way the music sounds and the songs are very well written and sung. I would like to see the band play live, because it would be very different from

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: So Hott may be a great choice for the intro to an album, but it just doesn't hold up as an album.  This is another song I would recommend as an add-on to a collection of music.  It is the closest to Pink Floyd that I've heard in a long time.  It is great to listen to while working out.  I would recommend this one as a "song for the day" if Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" is your album.

Amazon review: What I have to say about this song is that it's just not a good song.  It's just not a good song.  The song is great, though, for a party.  You have to think about where the song is coming from and where you are going to play it.  The song is great at the beginning of the night before you get ready to play it.  It's a song that you can easily change your mood for the next couple of hours of your night.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

The lyrics are a little difficult to understand, they're not at all in the lyrics book (my daughter can't read that well).  The recording is okay, but it's got a very thin sound and I don't like it.

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them. So I won't spend the money to buy the entire album. When this song is available to download individually, let me know and you just might get a sale.

Amazon review: This is by far the best Cd MJ has produced

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon review: This song first off was confusing because i didn't order it and thought I was getting charged for soemthing I didn't want. Amazon. a little warning next time please. I STILL cant find the song I DID order. Anybody can help with this? Im going in circles here. Secondly, the song was annoying at first hear but its a positive message and kindda "poppy". Cross between old Beatles music and Alternative rock. least its not filled with suicide, violence and cursing.

Amazon review: This song and the album are both cool. The songs are a little repetitive and it does take a little while to get used to the music, but it's really fun to listen to. The lyrics are really good and the music is good, but it would've been better if the songs had a little more variety. Overall though, this is a great album.

Amazon review: I have a feeling this is not going to be a good album. The way the song is sung is really off. It's weird. The chords are just weird. The way the song sounds doesn't match the song. I love that this music is supposed to be "synthetic". The song is very repetitive. I don't like it, but I can't stop listening.
