Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: There's no other album by the late J. S. Bach that sounds like it was recorded in a single session.  The recording of Bach's Cello Suites No. 1 and No. 2 on this album is a good demonstration of this.  Bach was a master of the recording studio.  He took a single instrument and recorded it in several takes.  When the artist was satisfied with the result, he would start over again.  The instrument was the same every time, and Bach would simply add one or two bars to the end of each.  This technique was used a lot in his day.  He also took many live performances of his music and recorded them in the same way.  This was very common in his time and still is in the recording studios of today.  This album is a testament to both of these techniques.  The music on this album is very intense, like the emotion of Bach.  When you hear one of his cello suites, you are taken away to a different place in time.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really enjoy listening to this album.  It is a must have for any Bach collection.  This is what I like about Bach.  He was able to combine the music from all his works on one album.  This is what makes his music so special.  He was also able to include a lot of the music from his older works on the same album.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: It is a very nice combination of all Bach's music.  There are many pieces, but I think the best are the suite No. 1 and the suite No. 2.  I especially like the opening of the first suite.  The second suite is very good too.  Very well done.
Sentiment: Positive

The way he played and wrote this music really made me want to learn more about Bach.  I really enjoy listening to this album.

Amazon review: I was a little disappointed in this album, as I really hoped that it would have been a better collection of songs than the one we got. I didn't like any of the songs that were on it and didn't connect with them at all and I am kind of disappointed that I didn't like it much. I would have picked it up if I could have but I didn't like it and it was a waste of my time.

Amazon review: This wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. There are only two songs in this album that I didn't like and I think that it was worth the money.

Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I wasn't expecting much from this album, and it wasn't half bad. I really liked "My First Christmas", the song that was on the CD, and "Merry Christmas" was great. "Hurry Home" was average, but I didn't mind listening to it. "A Christmas Story" was kind of repetitive, but it wasn't bad. I liked the track "Home Alone" a lot. "It's Christmas Time" was also nice. "Christmas Time Is Here Again" was my favorite track. The only song that I didn't like was the one with the two guys with the sledgehammer. That's why I didn't like it.

Amazon review: Love this song, reminiscent of Grover Washington Jr. Great style and warmth.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: From a band with the stature of Pink Floyd?  I understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to Richard Wright, but, being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums, I was certainly looking forward to more than this.  As were my Pink Floyd - loving friends who listened to it.  Sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums, but would work as add-on leads done live.  I hate to think poorly of these guys, but this sounds like they 'frittered away the hours in an off-hand way'.

Amazon review: I can't take issue with some comments, but would like to make it clear that I do not understand the meaning behind some of the comments.  "A Little Bit" is one of the few songs that I could relate to.  The rest are all over the place.  I am not sure what the reviewer means by "If you've heard the song before, then you already know the words."  If I've heard the song before, I know the words.  But, I also know they were not written with the meaning that they are now.  For example, I always thought the word "heart" was a reference to the heart of the person, not necessarily the heart of all the people in the world.  Now it is a reference to the heart of the world in general, and I believe the song is about that.  I know I've heard the song before, because I have a couple of friends who listen to it when I'm not around.  However, I know that I've never had a friend who didn't know the words.  I also think the song is about a friendship, but I don't think being in love is referenced.  I hope this clarifies my point.  It is like a song that says "this time I'm gonna stop the world and watch it fall."  I know that the singer can stop the world and watch it fall, but I don't think that is what the song is about.  And I don't think it is about love either.  In fact, I think it is about a relationship.  Love is something you go through, you don't stop.  And I don't think it is about love.  You can only go through it once.  It is about a friendship.  And I can understand the other comment that it is about heartbreak.  I can relate to that.  And I don't think that is what the song is about.  And, if that is what the song is about, why does the song tell you to'stop the world and watch it fall'?  There's a reason why it says that.

Amazon review: I couldn't have been more wrong.  I love the concept of this record.  I love the quality of the recordings on it.  I don't like the production, but it is the concept of it.  I love the song choices, but I also don't like the song choices.  I wish that the songs were more in line with the concept.  I don't like the instrumentation, and I don't like the vocals.  I like the vocals better than the instrumentation.  I don't think the song choices are well-executed.  But, the concept is still good.  I wish the band did a little more with the instrumentation.  However, I was totally expecting to like this record.  I was totally expecting to like the concept.  I was totally expecting to like the songs.  However, I didn't like the songs.  So, I don't know what happened.  I don't know why I didn't like the songs.  At first, I thought the songs were good, but then I didn't like them.  I wasn't expecting to like these songs.  I wasn't expecting to like them at all.  I'm not that into Pink Floyd.  I don't know why I like this band.  I'm not that into Pink Floyd.  I don't understand why.  I'm sorry to say that it is a little disappointing.  It's a little disappointing to me, because the concept and the concept alone is what made the record worth buying.  I wish that it didn't disappoint, but it does.  I wish that I could take the good with the bad.  But, I can't.  It's a little disappointing.  The thing that I liked about it the most was the concept.  It was an interesting concept to me.  And, I don't really know why I like the concept, but I do.  I don't know why I didn't like the songs.

Amazon review: The track listing seemed like it would be a good mix of styles, but it wasn't.  Maybe the best example of this is "I Know What I Like (Most)".  When I first heard it, I thought it was a song by a band that I'd never heard.  When I first heard it, I was really into the song.  The song sounded like something I was really into.  And, I was really into the song.  The song sounded like something that could have been on the radio.  And, I don't know why I thought that.  I guess I thought that because I have

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: I'm not a music critic, I cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can I tell you what they were going for.  I can simply say I did not enjoy the album.  One, maybe 2 good songs but nothing that I feel the need to immediately add to my play list.  I hope they, Zac Brown Band, plan to get back to country again soon.  Still listening to all of their other albums daily.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: I want to thank the folks at Amazon for getting "Bobby Jean" for me!!  It is the best Christmas album I've heard in ages!!!  I am a huge fan of Zac Brown Band, but I have to say that this is the best thing they've done in a long time.  I thought I was going to have to switch over to an oldies station after hearing this album, but I'm glad I didn't!  I love the way they blended old and new music. The oldie songs made me feel like I was listening to a good 70s band and the new songs made me feel like I was listening to a current band.  Thanks again, Amazon, for getting me this wonderful album!!  Love ya!!

Amazon review: This is the best album of the year.  I love the way songs are put together and how they all sound the same yet different at the same time.  This is a must have for any album fan.  Also, to say that I like the music better than the production of the album is an understatement.  I think that I have discovered the best album of the year.  I love it.

Amazon review: I am a fan of Zac Brown Band for a few years now.  This album, and the other albums that they have released, have really brought me back to love and appreciate music.  The production is not too bad.  I didn't realize how many songs there were until I played them all and found myself listening to the same songs over and over.  It's just that they are all so different yet have such a great sound that I loved it.  I'm listening to all of the songs and I am enjoying them all.  I just wish that there was a way to download all of the songs.  I would love to have them on my ipod.  I just wish they would release them in better quality.  Just because I love the music, doesn't mean that I like the songs that are on my ipod.  I think that they should make them available on iTunes.  I don't know if they have already made that change or not.

Amazon review: I've been a fan of Zac Brown Band for a while now, and I'm really enjoying the new album.  I've always liked the band's music though, and when they were touring here in the states, I had to see them in concert.  I've been a fan for a while now, and I'm really glad they've decided to put out a new album.  I really like the new songs on the album.  I think the album is better than the previous albums, which is why I am so happy that they're releasing a new album.  I love the songs on the album, and I love the production.  I wish they would come out with a single song instead of an album just so it would be more limited.

Amazon review: I'm not that into rock music.  I listen to a lot of country music though, and I really enjoy this country music that Zac Brown Band is known for.

I'm glad that they are putting out a new album, and I'm even more glad that I'm able to listen to it right now.  I will definitely be buying the new album when it comes out.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs to listen to when I am in a bad mood.  It has a really nice beat and it is just a fun tune to listen to.  It reminds me of the time when I was a little kid and my dad was in the band I was in, The Drifters.  When I was in grade school he would sing us these oldies songs on the radio.  When I was old enough to get a radio, I would sit by the radio that was always on and listen to these songs from my father's band on the radio.  My dad loved to sing and he has a very warm voice.  I do not think he sang in a bad way.  I think he just loved to sing.  When he would sing he would say the same thing with different words.  I think that is what makes this song so amazing.  I really like the original version of that song.

Amazon reviewer: Leonard Cohen's music is very hard to put down.  This is one of my favorite songs to listen to when I am in bad moods.  It has a really nice beat and it is a fun tune to listen to.  It reminds me of the time I was a little kid and my father was in the band I was in, The Drifters.  My dad loved to sing and he has a very warm voice, so I do not think he sang in a bad way.  He just loved to sing.  When he would sing he would say the exact same thing with different words.  I think that is what makes this so amazing.  I really like the original version of that song.  I just wish I could have known this song earlier.  Thank you for writing this article.

Amazon review: I bought this song because I thought it was Alex Care's "Too Close to Love You," but it's just an instrumental version of the song. It didn't say this anywhere in the description or anything. I wish I had known before hand so I didn't end up buying a song I didn't want.

Amazon review: I agree with the negative reviews of this CD.  Not a good CD for the price.  I purchased the CD as a gift for my daughter.  I didn't want her to be disappointed with her gift.  It is a gift for my husband, so he will find out he received a gift and not a CD.  It is very repetitive, and will be repeated to him as one of many gifts he will receive.

Amazon review: This is the second CD by the band "The Wasted Gift."  I have listened to the CD many times, and it is very good.  I have listened to the CD for many years, and I have not been disappointed.  The band is very good.  I wish the lyrics were a little more understandable.  I prefer the cover of "The Wasted Gift" to the cover of "I'm Sorry," but I can't see any difference.  I wish the lyrics were a little more understandable.  I thought the lyrics were more about the band, and less about the band's problems.  I wish the lyrics were a little more understandable.  The lyrics were easy to understand.
