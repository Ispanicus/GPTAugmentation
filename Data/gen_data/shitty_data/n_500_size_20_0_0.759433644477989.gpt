Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: There's no way this cd will take over the world, but at least it's the first "real" CD I've ever bought.

I love the sound of this cd, and the tunes are great.

Amazon review: I bought this for my girlfriend and it is the best thing she's ever purchased.  It is very similar to the one she prefers, but I love the sound better.  My favorite is "Let's Get Away From It All" and "So You Think You Can Dance", because they are short and fun.  I have an iPod (which I usually use to listen to music on my computer), so I have to listen to this in "brief" mode, and sometimes I don't want to hear the vocals.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I ordered this cd (and a few others) from Amazon to see if the selections were any good, and it was!  "Let the Good Times Roll" is the most popular song, so you should order the whole cd.  My favorite song is "All I Wanna Do" because it has a really fun feel to it.  It's not the best song, but it's the best for me.  There are songs I don't like, but I try to find something that I do, to get me to buy it.

I like the songs, and I hope to hear more of them, but I hate the cover.  it's really annoying.  overall, I'd recommend it.

Amazon review: I am not a big fan of the musical genre, but I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, and I think I like it.  It was my first song, so I'm really not used to the genre.  I don't think this is going to be my favorite song, but it's a good start.  I don't have any other songs that I like, so I'm sure there are some that would be good.  I have heard of this song before, but I don't know where.  it's a little overrated, but I like it.  the other songs I don't like are "All I Wanna Do" and "So You Think You Can Dance".  I'd recommend this, but maybe not as a gift.  I'd say it's worth a try, but I'm not sure I like it.  it's fun and cute.  I'd have to say I like it.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

I think this is the best of the five, and easily the best album of all time.  I'll buy this over and over.  This is the only album I've bought where I went back and listened to the original version.

Amazon review: It's a good album, but doesn't live up to the promise.  It's good to hear the sound of a band who can pull off an album, and sing, but doesn't have the fire to pull of the "hope and change" that the other bands sound like they've been doing it for years.

Amazon review: The thing is, it's a fun, energetic album that could have been better.  But that's what it is, and it is fun.  It is not the music that makes the album good, it is the people behind it.  That is what makes it great, and that is what makes it an album.  If the rest of the band had the chemistry that the lead singer has, it would be a lot of fun.  I'm not saying that there is not talent in this band, but I'm saying that they don't have the chemistry that you really need for an album.  It was just not entertaining to listen to.

Amazon review: When you have a singer that has a voice that goes into high falsetto range, then you have an album.  The sound is good, but the content isn't.  I liked the idea of Billy singing his song over the band's music but I didn't like the sound of the music.  It just sounds like a bad mixtape.  And the lyrics are pretty good, but the song structure was not.  It's not that I didn't like the song structure, but the lyrics were just not catchy.  I'll admit that the lyrics are fun and the tune was catchy, but the lyrics were in the wrong place and the tune was in the wrong place.  It's a good album, but it's not something that I would listen to again.

The songs just didn't work together, and it just wasn't worth the $10 I spent on it.

This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music.

Amazon review: I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song "heard it all before", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as "light cuisine". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

I am a Christian and I find it so ironic that this is one of the most censored songs I have ever heard. I do not agree with this at all. I think they should be left alone. I have been to concerts and they are singing their hearts out and I really wish I was a part of it because I would love to hear them live. I think her voice is one of the best in the world.

Amazon review: This poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic. Unfortunately I couldn't listen to more than one song on this record because it was SO scratched up. I know that's the risk you run buying the vinyl, but the seller did list this as 'Good' condition yet 90% of it was unplayable. Very disappointed.

Amazon review: This is the first time that I've had a problem with the quality of the music on an MP3 download. I ordered the song 'Sickening' from a site called CDBaby.com. The music did not play on my computer or the CD player I had purchased it on. After talking to the seller, I was told that the track had problems with the CD. I sent them an email asking for a corrected copy of the song. I was told that it would be 5 days before I heard from them. I was so excited to have a new MP3, but it turned out to be one of the worst songs I've ever listened to. It was so bad that I cancelled the order.

And yes, I gave the CD several tries, all the way through.  Even in my loyalty to a band I loved I can't convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album.  It's just milk toast.  Dull, uninspired and uninspiring. Sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms (really?

I really don't know how to describe how I feel.  It isn't bad music, it isn't a bad album.

Amazon review: I just got the new CD and I am still very confused about what to think of it.  I was at least half-liking it before I heard the whole thing.  I really don't know what to think.  I have listened to all of your albums so far and I am not a fan of your new stuff.  I'm not even sure if I like it.  I am not a fan of the bands you've been a part of.  I'm not a fan of your music, I'm not a fan of the fans you have, I'm not a fan of your music, I'm not a fan - I'm not a fan.  I am not a fan.  So I think the reason I like the CD so far is because I like your music.  But I also think that I will never be a fan of your music.  So I am not a fan, but I love your music.  I wish you good luck, and I hope that you make a new CD soon.  I hope I will be able to like it then.  I'm just not sure, I don't know if I like it.

I don't know if that makes me a bad fan or a bad person.  I like the new music.  I think it's really good, but I just can't get behind it.  I think you should find out why I find your music so hard to get into.  I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  I just can't get into your music.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: There are two bands that I like a lot that have a very similar sound to a lot of people; The Black Lips and The Strokes.
They're a good combination as they're both rock/pop, but they're very different. Strokes are a bit more upbeat, while The Black Lips are more introspective.
The Strokes have a lot of the same influences, like jazz, but they do it a bit more smoothly and with a lot more vocals, whereas The Black Lips approach it a bit more cleanly and with more production.
The Strokes are more of a band you just want to hear, whereas The Black Lips are a band you want to listen to from beginning to end.
This album has a lot of the same sounds, but The Strokes sound a lot more polished, and The Black Lips sound more raw and unpolished, so a lot of the songs blend into each other.
If you want a band that sounds like The Strokes, and The Black Lips, then this is the album for you.
I really like this album a lot.
