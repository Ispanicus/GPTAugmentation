Amazon review: -Incredible screams -Great melodic breakdowns -Incredible emotion  Curious to see how the next album is.  You can tell this band does their own thing/has their own style and doesn't conform.  That's what makes them great.  Cons: album is a little too short, some of the songs sound similar

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

Amazon review: Wow. These guys are better than I thought. They are pretty much the best band in my area. I have been hearing them for a year now and I've only been able to find them on the internet which is bad for them but good for me. I have to say the album is amazing. I was blown away with the guitar playing and the drums. All of the songs on here sound different in every way. The music is awesome. I can't wait to see what the next album brings.

Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: This song is too long.  It starts out nice, with a good tempo and strong melody, but just doesn't get anything going.  It is a good piano and harp piece, but there is no melody, just rhythm and repetition of chords.  The lyrics are great, but the music doesn't move me in any meaningful way.

Amazon review: When I first heard this song, I was so impressed that I ordered the album.  It is not a classical piece, but it is very well played.  It has a lot of the feel and style that I like, though I must say, the organ is not so loud as I would like.  There are only a few things that I could nitpick about the album, and they were the organ notes, but other than that, I thought it was a very good album.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning.

Amazon: I have never seen this movie, but I was looking at this Tron soundtrack on Amazon and I saw the movie Tron:Legacy, and I was curious to see how the soundtrack is in the Tron movie, so I bought the soundtrack.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: This is the best CD I have ever heard. I listen to this CD every day. I use Holosync in every day, and this CD has helped me tremendously. After I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer, my life began to change. I was scared and depressed. I was losing my hair and feeling so weak. I didn't know what to do, but I decided to stop working out and take Holosync every day. I was a very nervous wreck, but with the help of Holosync, I stopped feeling that way. I realized that this Holosync is helping me to feel like new again. I had almost reached the end of this CD, when I realized that I had received a message from God. A message that says, "I am God. I am the creator of all things. I am the healer. I am the one who sent you this CD. I am God. I created you so that you would have the ability to heal, to be strong. I love you so much. I want you to be strong and live your life to the fullest. I am so happy with you, and I am so proud of you. I hope to see you in Heaven, and I want you to see me in Heaven."

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I am so disappointed in the last 3 I bought b/c they were represented TO BE NEW  when they were only the same songs, rearranged or in a different language.  This is very poor representation especially for a new group. Whoever made those decisions should be fired. Their objective should b to make new followers, not loose them.  I have purchased 15 DVD's as presents and 2 "new" CD' and I will not purchase another because I've learned I can't trust the label.

I think I'll just buy the CD as a gift for myself.  I don't want to use it as a tool to promote my album.

Amazon review: I saw a car commercial for a car of your choice, you choose the color and the car is delivered to your door.  What happens if you pick the wrong color?  You are not the only person who had to put up with that ad.  I have had a lot of things I love with a lot of problems.  If you have no problems you have no problem.  I was in high school when I got the car for the first time.  It was a 1967 Mustang.  I was 17 years old.  I was excited and ready to go.  My dad was going to pick me up and we were going to drive to his home town.  We were going to have a good time.  When we arrived at my home town we pulled out of the parking lot and turned onto a side street.  The car stalled.  Dad said "I'll give you a hand" so I went in the house and got the tool kit and worked on the stalled engine.  It would not start.  I was angry.  I couldn't believe that someone else had to fix the car.  When I was finished, I drove it home.  I went to the house to get my jacket because we were going to a party and we were going to have a good time.  I went to the door to get my jacket and in walks the mother of the girl that my dad picked me up.  She said, "Hi Bob, I'm Mrs. Miller, your neighbor."  She said, "I bought you a new car, I didn't know what color it was going to be."

They tell you that it's a big investment and you'll have to wait six months to get it done.  The car is in need of a repair.  They go to work and they work all day long.  They come home and they drive off to do their job.  What are you going to do?  You are going to be mad at your car because it's in need of a transmission.  You are mad at the company because they are trying to sell you a new transmission.  You are mad at the company because they are trying to make money.  You are mad at the company because you are mad at the company because you are mad at your car because it's in need of a transmission.  What you want to do is go to the computer and tell the company what you want.  That way you can get your transmission that very day.  You don't have to wait six months to get it.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season). But overall I love it and I was able to make back up discs for each artist. I highly recommend it!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: Classic track where many have re sampled but have not topped the original creation. Check JDilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion.

Amazon review: Didn't like this version as much as the original but I still used this for a 50th Class Reunion Power Point presentation.

###
Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.
