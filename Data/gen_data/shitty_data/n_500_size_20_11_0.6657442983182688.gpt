Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I bought this for my daughter who just turned 6.  She LOVES it.  We listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip.  It brought me to tears to hear the old songs that shaped my spirituality when I was young, and I am so thrilled I can share it with my daughter.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: Wow, I don't even know where to begin this review, except to say that I am a huge fan of the band.  I've listened to them all over the years, but this is my favorite album they have ever put out.  I'm not sure how they do it, but they can make a band sound so much better than they do.  These guys have a lot of talent, and their music is so very, very good.  This is just a wonderful album.  I have yet to find any CD that has their music in it, that is all I can say.  There is so much good music out there.  I'm gonna have to buy this and listen to it all.  I've never been so hooked on a band in my life.  Thank you for taking the time to send this to me.

Amazon review: I've been in the car with my wife for about an hour listening to this CD.  My wife is totally into country music, and she knows all the artists, and has been listening to them for a long time.  This is the first time I have ever heard this CD, but I'm surprised at how much I can relate to the songs.  This CD is by far the best of all I have heard so far.  I must add that I am not a Christian, but I believe in God, and I know I'm completely wrong, but I have come to the conclusion that music is a very powerful thing, and I just have to believe in that.  Thank you for doing this.  I will be purchasing more CDs from you.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  I'm not too familiar with most of these songs, and they are all very good.  I'm not a country fan, but I do like some of the artists, and these are good.  Very few songs on this album have a repetitive or boring part, but it's not too many anyway.  I've listened to many CDs, and this one is the best so far.  I do have to say the lyrics are not what I want to hear from a Christian band, but I'm not a Christian either so it's okay.  I'm just not into the Christian music industry.  It's really not that bad.  I don't like most of it, but I can't say I hate it.  I do like some of it, but it just isn't for me.  I'm not going to lie, it really does get on my nerves after a while.  It's all very good, but it's just not for me.  I can't say this about most of the Christian music I've listened to, but this one is better, and I'm glad to hear that.

Amazon review: I'm a college student who enjoys listening to and playing music.  I'm a Christian, but don’t believe in the Christian music industry.  I don’t like the music, but I do like the lyrics, and I like the music.  I enjoy the music, but I don’t like listening to it.  I don’t know what it is about what I just said, but I don’t like the music.  It gives me a headache.  I'm not sure anyone else would understand what I mean, but that's how I feel about it.  I know I'm completely wrong, but I feel like I'm not supposed to like the Christian music industry.  It's not just me, but the whole Christian music industry, and I just don't understand it.  I just don't like it.  I don't understand why people have to force their religion on me.  I don't have to believe it, but it's just not for me.  I'm going to buy this CD because I like the songs.  I just don't like the lyrics, and I don't like the music.  I only buy Christian music because I really like the lyrics.  I don't like the music.  The lyrics are just boring to me.  I don't understand why.  I don't like the music, the lyrics, or anything about it.   I don't like listening to it.  I just don't like it.  It's not even good Christian music.  I would like to help people like me, but I just don't see anyone listening to it.  I don't understand why Christian music is the only type that is allowed.  It's not even Christian music.  I don't like it.  I don't understand why I can't listen to non-Christian music, so I guess I'll buy this CD to hear more Christian music,

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out.

Amazon review: I have trouble keeping this CD on.  The singing is dreadful. Her voice is horrible.  It sounds like she is calling the devil.  My kids leave when it is on.  I can not recommend this CD, it's just not good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It does not matter that she is not a good singer, she is an excellent songwriter. Her songs are beautiful, and the lyrics are good.  The problem is that she is not a good singer, and she has no good songs.  It is disappointing.

When I bought this album, I was hoping it would take me back to her as a musical idol.  It didn't.  I just bought this album because it was on sale.  I feel like I wasted my money.

Amazon review: I love her voice.  She is in the top 10 for me.  The only problem is her albums are a little boring.  I hope she changes her style of singing.  I was hoping she would be my favorite singer.  But, she is not.  She is more of a singer like Whitney Houston.  I still love her.  I am glad I gave this CD to my daughter's boyfriend.  I am glad he is a fan of her.  He is going to buy the CD and listen to the CD.

Amazon review: This product takes the form of two compact discs on the DECCA label. The conductor is Riccardo Chailly and the orchestra is Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin. The singer is Brigitte Fassbaender.  WARNING REGARDING FASSBAENDER.  In Das Klangende Lied, the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts.  But in all the other pieces in the two discs, the vocals are more prominent.  It is therefore the case that in these other pieces, the voice of Brigitte Fassbaender is what the listener hears most.

Amazon review: I used Holosync a few years back and starting with Awakening Prologue I then went on to the first level Awakening 1. I used this product for about two years, at least 5 days a week, and completed the full 1 hour session each time. I must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever. I gave it my best shot, I thought if I kept at it, one day I might have that 'aha' moment when I suddenly realised it was having some effect upon me. But no, nothing, nothing good happened, no overwhelm even, just nothing other than an hours relaxation I could have achieved by any other means.

Amazon review: It gives you the feeling of being with a group of friends in the club. I am quite impressed with the sounds of the tracks and the sounds in the club, the sound quality is good. The sound of the speaker is clear and crisp. The sound is also very good.

Amazon review: I have been wanting to learn to play the guitar for a while now. I have bought a few books on the subject but have always been unable to get the feel of the instrument. I have been purchasing guitar books and learning theory and this was the first book I have ever purchased that actually made me feel comfortable and confident playing the guitar. I have been playing guitar for the past 8 years and have been looking for something to help me get the feel of the instrument. I have been waiting for this book to be written but I am now really excited to finally own one.

Amazon review: This is a must have for any aspiring musician. I bought this book after reading an article about the author from Guitar World. This book has helped me so much. I have learned about many different types of wood, how they sound and how they are used in instrument construction. This book has helped me immensely in my guitar building, guitar tuning and playing to name a few.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This book is great. I have to admit that I have read a ton of books on the subject of wood, but none of them were quite as detailed as this one. It is an extremely in depth exploration of woods used in guitar construction, including a great list of materials and their characteristics. The most important thing I learned was that every piece of wood is unique, and not all wood is created equal.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I would recommend this book to anyone who is serious about getting into guitar woodworking. It is a great book for anyone who wants to learn more about the wood and how it can be used in music. The book is very well written, and clearly explains each and every aspect of the wood.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This book was amazing. I have been playing guitar for over 10 years, and have always been interested in learning more about the instrument and how to build it.

Amazon review: I am very pleased to say I am not a fan of this band.  If you are a fan you will like this album.  The vocals are very good, the guitar playing is good.  The guitar riffs are all very different, but the harmonies are very good.  The songs vary in the amount of harmonies they use, but the vocals are always very well blended and the guitar playing is always very good.  This album is very well put together, and I would definitely buy another CD in the future.  The only reason I gave it a low mark is that the guitar riffs felt a little bit overdone.

Amazon review: This band is very very good.  It is amazing how you can tell that they are young and still very much in the making.  The songs sound just as good as when they first came out, and I am glad that they are still out there.  They are young and still very good.

Amazon review: The other reviewer mentioned the available CD.  As a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals, I regretfully bought that CD.  It was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album.  The insert came straight off of a computer printer, the first band was silent (the actual recording started on the second band) leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone's basement.

Most of the songs are great but a few are not.  The only song on this album that I like is "I Want You Back"  I think this song is a must hear.  A good song, not great, but a must hear.

The only thing I don't like about this CD is the vocals.  I do not think that they are very great on this album, but I do think that there are some great songs on here.

I like the songs "I've Got the World on a String"  and "One Way or Another"  I like "The One I Love".

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: The song, "The Way You Make Me Feel," is written about the way in which I relate to my wife.  "Dirty" is a song describing an experience that took place after I had been involved in a verbal altercation with my wife.  The lyrics to "You Could Be Trouble" are similar to the song "Just Friends."  "The Way You Make Me Feel" is the first song on the album, and it is written about the way in which I feel about my wife.

Amazon review: As the first band to use the term "Rapcore" they have been credited with introducing the genre to a wider audience.  The album has a strong melodic base, yet the lyrics are not in depth or complex.  If you're looking for an album, that has depth and complexity, this is not it.

Amazon review: I don't know.  I've always liked the early KISS albums.  I can't really think of a reason to dislike this one.  The production is a little "too clean" for me, but that could just be my personal taste.  The songs are solid.  I would recommend it as a second album to anything else you may have.  It does have a little more "experimental" songs on it than I would have liked it to have had, but they are good songs.

Amazon review: The album is a good mix of traditional and new.  The only real flaw here is the production which is a little too polished for me.  However, that is a personal preference.  I guess I just like a little more "raw" sound.  The album has good songs, and I did enjoy the album overall.  The only thing I wish they had included here is more songs.  I may go buy the whole CD for other people, but I don't think I will really buy it.  The album is just too generic to be a great album.  I don't know how I feel about it.  I just can't really pick out one thing that made it not great.  I like the songs, I just don't really know why I like them.  They are solid, but I just don't really remember any of them.  The only thing I remember is "I Don't Care" and "Heart Of Stone."  Other than that I don't really remember any of them.  So it's just a really generic album for me.  It's also not really a rap album at all.  I don't know.  I just don't remember any of the songs.  I would have liked to have had more songs that I liked.

Sentiment: Positive

I have a great feeling about this album, I hope it will be good.

I like the way this album sounds, and the songs are really good!

I would have liked the album to be a little more pop-oriented, but that's just me. Still, I can't get enough of the music, and I'm really looking forward to hearing some more Lanny singing.

Just like i'm looking forward to next album...

My favorite Lanny song is still "This Is How It Goes"

I LOVED THIS ALBUM...

I really liked this album, it was fresh and different...

It was great to hear Lanny singing about his love for his friends, and I really liked the songs... but it wasn't my favorite album I've listened to Lanny (but I loved his other albums and will probably be listening to him soon as well)...

The album is really good, it's very unique and fresh with a little twist or two...

I enjoyed listening to this album...I'm glad I bought it...

I'm not sure what happens with the album when I listen to it, it could have been better, but I like the song to my favorite Lanny's songs: "This Is How It Goes" and "Here I Go Again"

I bought this album because it was recommended by someone I know who has a few album by Lanny

I bought this album because I have a friend who has heard about it, I thought I'd give it a try

I've been listening to Lanny in the car when I'm driving to work.

I haven't listened to any album by Lanny in quite some time, but I'm really looking forward to hearing this one.

I've read that this album is a mix between 'I Don't Want To Know' and 'Here I Go Again'. I can't get into the whole mix, but I do like the song "This Is How It Goes"

I'm not sure what I was expecting with this album. I thought it would be kind of a pop album, but it seemed more country. I don't mind country music, but I thought it would be a bit more modern. I was wrong.

I really liked this album, I don't really like country music, but I thought this album would be a little different.

Lanny is a lot of fun to listen to, he is very good at singing. The songs are very well written and have a great groove to them. I don't think there is a bad song on the album.

I think this album is a really good compliment to the other ones I have heard from Lanny.

My favorite Lanny song is still "This Is How It Goes"

I don't really know much about Lanny's music, but I really enjoy his singing style and this album sounds like it has a little of everything.

I bought this album on a whim. I was really looking forward to this album. I am glad I did. I really like Lanny's singing style. I also liked the songs that were on the CD and I think that this album is better then the ones I've heard from Lanny so far.

I bought this album on a whim. I was really hoping it would be a good representation of Lanny's style. I was not disappointed. I think this album is very good, and I really like Lanny's voice.

This is a great CD. I love the way Lanny sings, and the songs are well written and have great lyrics. I was not familiar with Lanny's work, and this album is a great introduction to his music.

I don't know anything about Lanny's music, but I really like his style of singing. The songs are very well written and have great lyrics. This album is a great introduction to Lanny's music.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: This is a great album! The album is filled with Sinatra classics from the '50s, '60s and '70s. And then there's a few originals. It reminds me of the original Sinatra album, but with some of Nancy's hits mixed in. The only problem is the vocals were a little too clean.

Amazon review: I purchased this album because I had a great deal of Sinatra records and this album was the only one that I needed to complete the collection. I listened to the CD several times until I felt that it was complete, then I listened to the CD again. After listening to this I realized that it is a Sinatra album. The song selection is very good, the material is very good.

Amazon review: I have several Frank Sinatra vinyls that I've purchased over the years. This is one of the better albums I've ever purchased. This album is a great listen. The albums are pretty much the same but there are some surprises. I was very disappointed with The Very Best of Sinatra. I was hoping that this album would be better but it's not. I really don't know why the album was discontinued. I was hoping that this album would be better than The Very Best of Sinatra.

Amazon review: I just cannot get enough of Plumb.  He has the best voice, and the lyrics are great.  I just wish he would put more emphasis on the vocals.  The song is so good & the message is great it just could be a little more focused on the vocals.  But that is a minor complaint.  He wrote a book, now he has to write a song!  I'm enjoying the song so much.  I think it's so good message is great I just love it.  I also find some of his songs too repetitive.  I think he needs to add more to the music on his albums.  But I'm enjoying the song so much I have to give it 5 stars.  I would like to have more songs like this.  He has the best voice, and the lyrics are great.

Amazon review: I think this was a good song, but it could use a little work.  The lyrics could use some work.  There are some lyrics that sound good, some that don't.  Also, the song could use more of a hook.  I just don't think there is enough to make this a great song.  It's okay though.  I'll give it a try, though.  I think this song is so great.  It's just so powerful!  I love the message.
