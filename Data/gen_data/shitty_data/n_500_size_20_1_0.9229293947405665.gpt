Amazon review: Awesome value! This is a great mix of classic Christmas tunes, instrumental and vocal, and is perfect for having on in the background of a Christmas party. For $.99 there's no better value.

Amazon review: I got turned to Brody Dalle from her Spinnerette album, which I think is great! This one did not deliver like that one for me but I'm still listening to it. I love Brody's voice and passion she sings with so I'll keep listening. Usually for me when an album does not hit me right away, it will a little later, we'll see.

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself. These songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible. i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly, feel a bit embarassed for her too :-(

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: I do not know how the record company did that to her voice, it sounded terrible, like she was singing through a cardboard box with a hole cut in the top. I did not buy this album so I could not give my opinion, but I did read the reviews on Amazon. I'm glad I did not buy this album, I would not have liked the voice, and I would not have liked the music. I was really disappointed in the whole album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: One thing I don't like about the album is the songs are all the same, I don't know who the artist is nor do I know why she sings as she does. You can tell she's a talented singer but she puts her talent to use in a way that's not professional.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I just tried this album and it's pretty good actually. Very nice sound. The vocals are very good. I like the guitar work on this album. I was a bit disappointed at the way she sings. She's very very bad. But I like the song "I'm the Ghost of Christmas Past" very much.

Amazon review: I absolutely loved this album. The lyrics are so beautiful and the music is wonderful. I purchased the album just to listen to the music, and now I can't listen to the songs. I had to stop the album because the songs were so annoying, and so difficult to listen to. I don't understand why I had to stop the album. I'm just going to pretend I bought it so I can listen to the music. The music makes me cry. The music makes me laugh. I'm going to be sad and cry when I'm done listening to this album. I hope I can listen to it again. This album is a life changer for me.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: This disc has a lot of things going for it. The album has been remastered, in my opinion, and the tracks have a high degree of quality. The mix of the music is very nice for the most part, and I have no problem with the bass-heavy tracks. The only problem is that the track selection is very inconsistent. For some reason, I had to play the whole disc in order to find songs I like, but at least I get to listen to the whole album, and not just a few songs here and there.

Amazon review: I have found a few pieces of music on this album that I really like, however, I find the sound to be lacking.

I think it would be better if they had a slightly higher volume level throughout.

Amazon review: I have listened to this album a number of times and while I can pick out a few of the songs which I like, I have yet to find a truly original song on it. This album is basically pop and is full of songs that are just too similar to each other. These songs are so similar that they are almost identical, making it very hard to find something new or unique to say about them. I have tried to listen to this album on more than one occasion and find myself going back to the same songs over and over again. I just find myself bored with this album.

A:

This is the closest answer to the question I am asking, but it is not the only one possible.
I am talking about the song "The Greatest Love of All".
The song is by The Carpenters.  From Wikipedia:

"The Greatest Love of All" is the thirteenth song from The Carpenters' fifth album, The Greatest Hits. It was written by Harry Stinson and produced by James Taylor and the Carpenters' manager, Chris Thomas. The song was recorded at the A&M Studios in Los Angeles, California, with Taylor and the Carpenters' touring band, in November 1985. It was released in April 1986 by A&M Records, as the first single from the album. The single peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, and number two on the UK Singles Chart, where it topped the singles chart for three weeks, becoming the group's second and last number one single in the UK. Taylor and the Carpenters performed the song at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards, where Taylor won the award for Best Male Video.

The Carpenters are a group of singers from Canada, and Taylor is a member of their backing band. He played guitar on the first three songs from The Greatest Hits, and it is possible that he was the one who wrote "The Greatest Love of All".

EDIT:
In case anyone knows more about this song than I do, I would like to add this information to it:

"The Greatest Love of All" is sung by Harry Stinson.  He was a Canadian singer.  He was born on May 18, 1958.
Harry Stinson died on November 29, 2013, due to pancreatic cancer.  This song was his last appearance on stage as a performer.  At the time, Stinson was a member of the group The Carpenters.

"The Man Upstairs" is a great song.  I'm glad that these songs are there, but they just shouldn't take away from the rest of the album.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: I don't think anyone over the age of 16 likes (or can relate to) Nirvana or Kurt Cobain unless they are unemployed (playing gigs in a band doesn't count). Once you become become of that age, the most important things are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school. Clearly, the people here are the pre-teen target audience. Look at the misspellings, look at the abbreviations of even simple words, and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really like this album.  The only thing that kept me from giving it a five was the fact that I like the Beatles, so I didn't like the fact that so many of the songs have vocals by the same people (I've never seen any other band with the Beatles' vocals).  But the music is really good.  I'm still a big Beatles fan, but I think this album is great.  I hope it does well.  It's not my favorite album of all time, but it's still pretty good.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really like this album.  I can't remember the last time I was so into a new album.  I also like the fact that so many of these songs are cover songs.

I just think they didn't do them justice.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really liked the album.  I feel like I could have done a better job with the songs.  I liked the cover of "In Your Eyes" best, but the rest of the songs just didn't "come out" as they should have.

###
Amazon review: This is one of those albums that can be easily recommended to non-fans.  It's so hard to categorize these albums, and so many of them just don't fit into any category.  I think I've heard every Beatles album in my life, but there are some songs I still haven't heard.  And then there are some songs I only know because of videos on YouTube.  This is one of those albums that has that "Oh, I've heard of this song, but I never realized how good it is until I found this video." thing going on.  I think the only ones I haven't heard are "Twist and Shout" and "I Want to Hold Your Hand."
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I always knew that the Beatles were "the one" band in the world.  But I had no idea how good this album is until I read some of the reviews.  I loved the fact that this is the first Beatles album I've ever heard, and I think that makes it even better.  I wasn't expecting much from this album, but it's really a great one.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I really love this album.  I have the original vinyl, and I listened to it constantly, even when it kept getting scratched.  I also have the deluxe version, which has even more songs (some of them are the best songs of their albums, and some of them are the most overrated songs of their albums).  I'm really glad that I bought the deluxe version.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I really liked this album.  I've always been a Beatles fan, but this album really made me want to find out more about the band.  I thought "Rubber Soul" was the best one, but I really enjoyed the album overall.  The Beatles were always the best rock band in history, and this book makes it clear that their music was more than just a musical group.  This book was one of the best books I've read, and I highly recommend it.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album.  It's a great album.  It has some great songs, some really bad songs, and some songs that I really like.

The Beatles are one of my favorite bands of all time, and this book was a great way to find out more about them.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

My Review

This is the album I've been waiting for since the first time I heard Bob Marley and the Wailers. I'm not a big fan of rap or even hip-hop, but after I heard Bob playing on the record I was very impressed. To me, the saxophone is the secret ingredient to an excellent band. I was intrigued by Bob's music, and I was even more intrigued by him.

The first song I heard was "Soul Survivor", and it blew me away. I was so impressed with the saxophone playing on this song that I immediately bought the album and listened to it on my way home from work. I was hooked by the album, and I couldn't wait for more from Bob.

I was listening to "Soul Survivor" for about an hour before I even realized I was listening to the actual album. I'm not a big fan of rap or hip-hop, but after listening to Bob's music I was so impressed by his playing on that song that I couldn't wait to return to the record shop to buy the rest of the album.

When I got home, I loaded it up on my CD player and tried to play it. It sounded great, but I was more interested in the instrumentals on the record. I was mesmerized by the instrumentals and I couldn't wait to hear more.

I downloaded it, listened to the first three songs, and could not believe the difference. I listened to the whole album for about 30 minutes before I even realized I had the album. I was hooked and I couldn't wait

Amazon review: Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing.  Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated "Rave 'til Dawn" would sound to me.  It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music!  I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night.

Amazon review: What a great album, and what a great song!  I have a huge soft spot for country music, especially from the early 20th century.  This is one of the best examples, but it's always nice to have a couple of songs you can sing along to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I remember going to see the band perform this on the Fox network and it was amazing!  I'm a fan of their music and have been collecting it for years!  I've been listening to their music on and off since the 90's and it's always great to hear the band.

Amazon review: I love this album!  The first time I heard this song I was shocked.  I thought, "What the hell is this?!  Did I just hear a song?"  It took me a few listens to realize it was a great song.  At the same time, it's a lot of fun to have a song you remember hearing at some point in your life, but can't quite remember exactly where.  It's like having that song on repeat in your head.  I love the guitar riff in this song.  It's awesome!
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This is a great song that fits perfectly in the 90's music genre.  It's so popular that many people have a hard time thinking of it in any other context.  It's a little cheesy but it's a great song that everyone should know!  There aren't many songs that have that kind of universal feeling that this has.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I love this song!  I can't explain why it's one of my favorites.  If you're a country music fan, this is a must have.  It's got that 60's/70's feel to it and it's so fun to sing along to!

Amazon review: I was raised on this music, so this was one of my first purchases.  It doesn't get any better than this.  This song is just one of those songs that you listen to again and again.  It's a great song.  I like the way the guitar is played.  It's fun to listen to.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't think I've ever heard a country music song with a better guitar riff.  It's got everything a country song needs: a great guitar riff, a catchy chorus, and a fun and exciting melody.  I would listen to this song over and over again!

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: I really like the song "Journey". I like the way it starts, and the last line of the song is very beautiful. However, I don't like the first line: "I'm so far away from home, I don't know when I'll see my home. It's a journey, a journey, a journey". You're already singing the first line at the end of the song!
