Amazon review: I have always loved Josh's beautiful, full baritone, and it's wonderful that he's bringing back this collection of beautiful, timeless songs, but I found myself surprisingly disappointed.  He's done something to change his technique, and he often sounds nasally, especially when he sings words with the "E" vowel.  I think he's been ill-advised in this latest singing technique, and I'm hoping he'll go back to his previous methods!

Amazon review: I am an avid fan of John Mayer's music, and have been a fan of his ever since he released the first of his "best of" compilations in the mid-00's.  I have always thought his music was great, but have been disappointed by his last couple of releases.  The latest was his collaboration with Miley Cyrus, and I am saddened that he has decided to play it safe because he has.  His new work is great, I love the pop sound of this, and so do his fans, but I was not impressed with his new songs.  I have a few favorites, but for the most part, this new stuff is just not my cup of tea.  I am looking forward to his upcoming album, and have really enjoyed his music from the past few years.  I hope he will come out with a great CD.

Amazon review: I'm not a huge David Crowder fan, but this is a great addition to the set.  The album is worth the $9.99, and so is the inclusion of the acoustic version of "You Are the Only One".  I like the acoustic version, but I don't like this version of the song, so I am not a big fan of this album.  I do however like his two albums that I've purchased since this one, and they are great.  I'm only posting this review because I purchased the album, and I wanted to share my experience with you.

Amazon review: I have had a few David Crowder albums (The Best of, The Best of the 80's, and his last live CD) and each one is at least a little "different" and is a great listen.  I think the most important thing is that this album, in its entirety, reminds me of what David was capable of with his voice, and how he used it to tell a story.

Amazon review: I bought this album a few weeks ago and have listened to it quite a bit.  I love the songs on this disc, and each one is a different style of song, but it has been on my CD player for over a week and I am still playing it.  I am glad that I bought it, as I have not been able to listen to it in a long time.  My favorite song on the CD is "The Only One".

Amazon review: I have been a fan of David's music since his days in the 70's.  I was at a show with the band The Tubes back in the 90's and David sang a song for us.  I was absolutely blown away.  His voice was powerful and I was in awe of him.  I have heard that he has suffered a great deal with a series of medical problems and that it has been a very difficult time for him, but I am glad that he is back and making music.

Amazon review: I have loved David's voice since his days in the 70's, and I am excited that his comeback is going to be as amazing as his career has been.  He has one of the best voices in popular music.  I have always thought his voice was great, and this album shows that he is still at the top of his game.  I have enjoyed his albums from the past few years, but this new one really does not do it for me.  I would rather listen to some of his classic stuff.

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: It's been a few years since I've seen Demby live. There's something about his music that really resonates with me. I'd have to say I'm not a huge fan of his style of singing, but it's the melodies and his voice that make his music so special. His voice is very unique and his performance is very moving. The entire performance is very moving as is the music.

Amazon review: Demby never fails to surprise me with the way he opens his mouth and makes the most unbelievable, heartbreaking and beautiful sound. He never fails to make the audience feel like they have been personally transported to a place that they have never been before. He is an artist who has a gift in his art and in his soul.

Of course I did expect this album to sound different than the Killers. but this difference is sound went the wrong way.  Everytime I have first heard a Killers album I have loved it.

Amazon review: I have been a fan of this band for a long time.  I am not sure why but I feel like I have been waiting to hear a new Killers album.  This album is more of what I expected from them.  The songs are upbeat and fun, but I am a little disappointed with the songs.  The songs I personally like best are the ones with "messages".  The "messages" that I have seen are about self acceptance, being happy, being strong, and being a parent.  I love the message and I am very excited for the new album!

Amazon review: I have to say I was a little disappointed.  I was hoping that the album would have more of a variety of songs with different styles, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.  I was hoping to hear something that was more upbeat, but the songs lacked that.  I was hoping to hear more songs with "messages" and not just a song about "goodbye" but I don't think I'll ever get that.  I was hoping to hear more songs with a positive message but I don't really think there was one in this album.  Most of the songs were very generic and didn't have a message.  I am not a fan of "messages" at all.  I was hoping for a more diverse album with a positive message but I didn't get that.  I don't know what to say really.  I am just disappointed with this album.  I have loved songs that have messages.  I have loved songs that have "messages".  I have loved songs that have a positive message.  This album is going to be hard to listen to.

Amazon review: I want a new online music store, I want a new music store, one that don't just sell mp3s, one that will sell me original cd quality downloads, one that will take the time to respect the music, one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should. Seriously bought one single just to test it out, cause I don't want to pay $40, for the original cd (reprint).  I'm not a audio snob, but I payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup.

Amazon review: I don't like the fact that So Hott is available to download only as part of the entire album. I checked out the previews of every other song on the album and I don't like any of them.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: One thing that I love about this album is that it was recorded in the early 70's. I remember a few years ago in a church we had a song that was originally recorded in 1954. It was recorded in the early 70's. They were not happy with the word that was used in the song, so they had the word changed to something else.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: I wish I could say that I am not bothered by this song, but it is too catchy and I think that I would have to say that it is simply a waste of time to listen to it.

I think that this song makes me feel uncomfortable and that it should be removed from my library.

Amazon review: This is a song that I have a lot of trouble with because of the way the lyrics are written.  The lyrics are not to be taken literally and there are many versions out there.  There is the version where she is singing about how much she loved the man who just killed her brother.  And then there is the "real" version where she is saying that it is OK to kill her brother.  She has an entire album of these two songs side by side.  I can not make up my mind which one I should listen to.

Amazon review: I'm not really a fan of Kiesza's music because of her vocal style.  On this song, however, I agree with the other reviews, that I do not care for it.

I'd rather listen to a song that tells my daughter that she is loved.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Crystal Bowersox has alot to offer, but to me, songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here, along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level.  I think the hope with Crystal was that she could Joplin it a bit - that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasn't her strength.  This album is more like day in the life ditties.

I don't know how many of you know about the person who came up with the idea for this album.  I can't remember who it is.  It was someone who has been around for a long time.  She was a pioneer in the music field.  I have only heard her voice on one album and I loved it.  The album is called "Songs of a Woman" and the album cover shows a woman sitting on a chair singing.  The album was written by a woman.  She started it and then it went to several people.  She was instrumental in getting it released.  It is a beautiful album.  I have bought many albums at full price from Amazon.  I have never been disappointed, but this one is not my favorite.  I have been on the fence about buying it, but I have decided to buy it.

I love the lead singer, but I have to say I do not like the songs on the album.  They are repetitive and are not up to par with the lead singer.

I have to say that I was a big David Lee Roth fan back in the day and I have to admit that I missed out on a lot of his albums because of his drug addiction and the way his music affected me.

I am not going to be mad about this album. It is worth your time to listen to and if you like it, buy it. If you don't like it, don't buy it.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: This is a fine version of the song and is actually a pretty good jazz version of the song. It can't hold a candle to the Cole Porter version however, which is a lot better.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I loved this recording, especially for its great arrangement and the good use of the orchestra. The arrangements are very close to the original Cole Porter version. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that it sounds like a Cole Porter/Bing Crosby version instead of a Cole Porter/Mary Martin version.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: This song has a very interesting arrangement and is a good jazz setting of the song. I would have preferred it to be a bit longer or to have it as an instrumental track, however.

Amazon review: This is the first Cole Porter song on this new album.  I don't know what to think about this one, but I enjoyed it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have a hard time with the song. The first few notes aren't the same as the Cole Porter version. The melody is different. I don't know why Ray isn't playing the melody as the song comes to a close. But that's ok, because it's much better than the original. The end verse is fine, but the chorus is so boring. I'm not sure what's missing, and I'm not sure why they changed the melody in this version. But as an example of the difference between the original and this version, it is much more interesting!
