Amazon review: This album has a ton of great tracks.  I have to give it credit for me being somewhat of a fan of Bruno Mars. I mean, he's a great singer and all, but I think his songs are very, very average.  But this album has some good songs and I like most of them.  I love the song "Billionaire".  The song "I can't beleive it" is also good.  The song "Hands" is good.  The song "Proud" is good.  The song "Sexy and I Know It" is good.

The album's first single, "Spin", is very energetic and uplifting (and the video made me dizzy).

The album is full of songs with titles that start with B. And the song that has the song name ending with B is not even in the album.  I've also heard the word "baby" mentioned a few times.  I've read that this is her only album, so I'm not surprised.  However, I'm really frustrated that this is the only album she's made, and she's getting so little recognition for it.

Amazon review: This album reminded me why I loved the Newsboys so much through the 90s and 2000s. These songs are a great mix of catchy tunes, fun lyrics, and Biblical truths. Furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together.  The highlight of the album for me is "It's Alright (for Lazarus)." I heard the song for the first time when I was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry.

Amazon review: I got this album from a friend.  I gave it to him, and he played it for me.  I liked it.  I will make a comparison to the album by The Newsboys.   The Newsboys have a more traditional rock sound.  This album has a much more country sound.  The Newsboys are just a little more pop oriented.   The Newsboys do not have a country sound.  The Newsboys are more classic rock.  The Newsboys are the more polished versions of a more traditional rock band.  The Newsboys have a lot more talent, and they are more polished.   I know this because I've listened to a lot of different rock bands, and the only ones I've liked are the ones that have a little bit more country sound.   The Newsboys are not like that.  They are more traditional rock bands with a little bit of country in them.   This is the worst album of the 90s that I have heard.  It is just a generic country album.   I am not sure if it should be called "Al, Country" or not.  It is just a generic country album.   It doesn't have a single good song except for "Christmas Time."   And the album is not that good.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I was always a fan of Al's, but I wasn't really into his Christian music.  I heard this album and loved it.  The lyrics are very catchy and the music is great.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

But it isn't music that makes me yell at people in the car to shut up so I can listen to the band - I suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it.

I don't want to be one of those people who says that rap isn't a genre, but I can't really disagree, because I'm not really into any of the mainstream rap.  When I say mainstream, I don't mean the kind of rap that people talk about all the time in hip-hop magazines.  I mean the kind of rap that people talk about when they go to a mall and see people there who wear the same sneakers, talk about the same movies, wear the same clothes, and even look like they're in the same room.  I guess I'm talking about the kind of rap that people listen to on the radio when they're driving in their car; the kind of rap that people listen to in their living room when they're watching television; the kind of rap that people listen to during their lunch break, when they're walking to work; and the kind of rap that people listen to on their car speakers when they're on the way home from work.
I know rap has become more popular these days, but I think that it is a genre that is very difficult to become popular, because it is constantly changing.  The only way that rap can become popular is if you are the one making it popular.  If you're the one who is making it popular, that means that you will have to make it popular in the minds of a lot of people.
I'm not a fan of rap, but I really don't know how to describe what I feel, because there is so much that I like about it.  I just know that it is one of those things where you can sit down and listen to it every day and not get tired of it.  It is like nothing else.
There are some rap records that I really enjoy with great lyrics, and others that I really enjoy with great music; but I just don't know how to describe why I feel that way.  All I know is that you have to love rap, and I think that it is very difficult to do that.

I think that rap is a form of art that is very difficult to get famous or to make more money from.  It is very hard to get people to like you, because you don't have a signature sound or image.  You are not known as something  that people can turn to for advice.  I think that it is very difficult to be able to tell an intelligent story, for example, and be able to tell your own story with your own voice.  Because you are not seen as an authority figure, people are not going to listen to you very much.
I am not saying that the music is bad, but I think that it is very difficult for people to find the music that they like.  There are millions of people out there who love rap music, and there are millions of people out there who don't.  I think that it is something that is very difficult to get people to like you, because there are so many people out there who don't like rap music.
I think that it is very difficult to become popular because there is so much that you have to do to get people to like you.  You have to be able to write a good song that people enjoy listening to, and you have to write a good song that people enjoy listening to.  You have to be able to tell a good story, and you have to tell a good story with your own voice.
I think that it is very difficult to be able to make people listen to you, because you have to be able to write songs that people really enjoy listening to.  You have to be able to put music out that people really enjoy listening to.  You have to be able to make people listen to you, and you have to make people want to listen to you.
I think that it is very difficult to get fans because people don't really like you until you get them to like you.  I think that it is very difficult for people to get fans because they only like you when they like you - they don't really like you until they like you.
I think that it is very difficult for people to get fans because it is a very difficult thing to do - to make people listen to you.

"Have a Cigar" (Although it has some very good lyrics).

Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question.

Amazon review: I have to say that I really like this song.  I have tried to take her out of the ghetto and show her the world. She just can't hear them.  It is a nice song and I feel that the person who wrote it can sing well.  I don't know why I bought this.  I am not sure why I purchased this.  I don't know why I purchased this.

When I first listened to this album on my iPod I thought it was great, but when I got it in the mail I was a little disappointed.  There are a few songs that I enjoyed but the album as a whole is not that good.

Amazon review: This song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talks of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship. It's not crying, but mere acceptance of the inevitable. Toni Braxton sounds beautiful in it.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

Amazon review:  Keith Sweat, the man has lost the use of his voice.  When I heard him sing for the first time back in the early 90's, I didn't recognize his voice, but I knew he was a master musician, and now that I know his voice, I'm sure the rest of us can see his talent.  His voice has changed from that of a man in his late 20's to that of a man in his 40's.  He is still a very likable guy, and not at all bitter, but he needs to live life for himself.  If I was him, I would do what he does and put his music on repeat to keep his mind occupied.  He is an amazing musician and deserves to be in the limelight!

Amazon review: I like this song!  I like it so much I bought it.  I like the production.  The lyrics are good.  I was really disappointed in this album.  I don't know what happened there.  I mean, this album is great and well arranged.  It's got a lot of good songs on it.  It's not a bad album.  But, the lyrics are horrible.  The guy raps about shooting people and then he raps about how he would give his brother a blow job.  Then he raps how he would give his brother a blow job after he shot him.

Amazon review: I like the lyrics.  I like the production.  The beat is good.  The singer is good.  I don't like the rap.  I don't like his vocals.  I don't like his delivery.  He's not a good singer.  He's kind of a whiny guy.  I don't know what happened to him.  I don't know how he got away with all the bad things he's said.  I don't like his music.  I don't like his style.  I don't like what he says.  I don't like what he raps about.  I don't like his looks.  I don't like what he looks like.  I don't like who he is.  He's an alcoholic.  He's a loser.  I don't know what happened.  I think he's a good artist.  He's got talent.  I think he's got a great voice.  I think he's got a great voice.  I think his album is great.  It's got a lot of good

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: That is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased.  I will find something better.  Not worth it.
