Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

I received the first of two gifts from my Secret Santa.  The first gift was a small, colorful, wooden, hand carved wooden sculpture of the Demby Earth Mother.  She is sitting on a pedestal of black volcanic rock, holding a baby orchid in her lap.  She is wearing a long, flowing, black robe and is holding the baby orchid in her arms.  The orchid is beautiful.  The Demby Earth Mother is also very beautiful and has a soft, rounded face with large, brown eyes and dark brown hair.  She has a very sweet, friendly, earthy, and caring personality.  This is an excellent gift for a very special woman who is very beautiful and very nice.  She will love this gift.

Amazon review: I don't agree with the earlier reviewer.  The beats are pretty nice. If you're looking for strictly old school sounding beats, that have a very raw/rough feel and sound. The right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals, etc on top.  If, however, someone is looking for larger selection of beats, some with music, they could check out "Heat Beats" vol 1 by Royalty Free, then there's also a beat collection by a company called Major League, or something like that.

Amazon review: Great song, but the quality is pretty bad.  Just bought this as I had a lot of money to spend.  I do have a lot of music on my hard drive, so this was the best thing I could think of to listen to while watching television.  I've already downloaded about 5 other songs to my hard drive.

Amazon review: I came to this wanting to like it. I have been a fan of Pink Floyd since forever. I have all of Roger's solo works, seen him a few times back in the 80s on the Radio KAOS tour and again for his Dark Side of the Moon tour. I am a fan. My biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of Roger's work is it is so unnecessarily bleak. If life is really that bad, get a puppy! I mean, I find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this "I hate this - I hate that and so should you" drivel and just keep raking in the cash.

Amazon review: Like Steampunk? Well, this is Electro-swing - and about half of the Electro-swing albums I find, I'd call 'Steampunk Themed' music.  Caravan Palace is one of the best 'Steampunk' Electro-swing albums that I've found.  I highly recomend it.  Be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that's what I like about it (it makes it a bit more timeless). It's fantastic for driving, or background music at parties. Enjoy!

Amazon review: I never get tired of this group's music it always keeps my attention.  It's a great party song for a bar or restaurant.  The first couple of times I heard it, I actually thought it was a classical piece.  I have to admit, I like the first couple of times it came on I thought it was pretty good - but I don't like it any more.  It's the 2nd time I've heard it - and I've got to say, it's just not my cup of tea - I'm sorry - I don't know what it is.  But I do know, I'm not going to be listening to it over and over again.  I'll just have to listen to it once or twice - just to get used to it.

Amazon review: I do not recommend this collection! The songs are okay, not great. The songs did not fit the songs. The songs are all very short and the songs were not long enough. I really liked the last song but it was kind of a throw away song and my favorite song was the one that had all the songs in one song. I do not like when I find something that I like and find out that I still have to buy the rest of the album.

Amazon review: I bought this cd and was very disappointed! I was excited to listen to a new artist, and then I found out that I would have to buy all the cds to listen to them. I can't believe that this cd has the same songs over and over again. I am not a huge fan of the music genre, but I love the vocals. I don't understand why they are so repetitive. I like the singers voice, it's like she's singing to herself and not to anyone else, but they are just singing the same notes over and over again. I really don't like the music genre, and I don't understand why people think that this is a good cd.

Amazon review: I bought a cd because I wanted to listen to a lot of different kinds of music. So I bought it and listened to the cd. I was hoping that I would find more songs like "Ladies of the Canyon". But, after listening to about 20 songs, I found out that it was just the same songs over and over again. The songs were very short, and there were no lyrics. I found the lyrics very easy to understand, but I don't think that they go with the song. The songs were okay, but it was very boring.

Amazon review: What could be better than this album? I'm sorry, but this cd is an absolute waste of time and money. I would not recommend this album to anyone. I would be surprised if any artist would even consider putting this album out. All of the songs sound the same. They are just songs that are just repeated over and over. The song that I liked best had no lyrics and the song that I didn't like at all has the same chords over and over. The songs were very short and just repeated the same notes over and over again. I will not spend more money on this album or a cd that I am not going to like.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: I love the original video recording, but this version adds way to much instrument background music.  Makes it difficult to hear the words at many points in the song.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: The sound on this cd varies so much from "impossible to hear" to "explosive", it's impossible to discreetlly play in the office.  One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.  Susan Boyle's voice is low, almost a mumble, and she sounds like a little girl- not like the Susan Boyle we hear on other selections.  I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know what to say about this album.  I like the concept, the artwork, the music.  But... it's just a mess.  It doesn't work.  It's not cohesive.  There's so much background noise and distortion that the vocals sound like they're coming from a different room.  No vocals, no guitar, no piano (which is odd), no bass, nothing.  The sound of the guitar is just like someone is playing an electric guitar with a huge amp attached to the body, while someone is sitting on a stool in the background, playing the bass and the keyboard.  I wish the recording quality was better.  I wish I could go online and hear the audio for this CD.  But I can't.

Amazon review: I love this album.  It's one of my favorite albums of all time that I've downloaded.  I'm not too crazy about the lyrics, but the message is what's important to me.  I'm not trying to offend anybody, I just believe that people have the right to express themselves in their own way.  It's not "right" to use sexual references.  It's not "right" to use religious references.  It's not "right" to use racism references.  It's not "right" to use war references.  It's not "right" to use homophobia references.  It's not "right" to use violence references.  It's not "right" to use violence references.

It gives me hope that the world is still a better place than it was in the past, because I know that the world is a better place than it was in the past.

Amazon review: This is a good beginner collection to classical music. It does lack some key pieces which is why I gave it four stars (no Danse Macabre, and Vivaldi's Four Seasons masterpieces are incomplete - just one part from each season).

Amazon review: I just received my CD and based on the way it was packaged and the inside of the CD case, it is not new as advertised.  The CD was re-packaged with plastic, the inside piece that holds the CD in place is broken and the broken pieces are missing so I know it did not some how break during delivery, the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the CD has marks on it.  I do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold as new when that is clearly not the case.

Amazon review: I have all Josh's awesome music and I purchased this CD without even listening to it first based on his other CD's. wish I would have listened to it first. Not what I expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didn't work for me. there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work I was use to. maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but I never had to wait for his other work to grow on me. it just blew me away right from the start.

Amazon review: Pearl Jam is the band that basically told MTV to f- off after their FIRST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until their demise How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got huge because of their music & they made even less music videos than Nirvana Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam is truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobain never did FACT: Cobain used to call MTV & tell MTV to play Nirvana's music videos more

Amazon review: I really enjoy this album. It's got some nice guitar riffs and a good mix of different styles. It's not all the same kind of music that I am used to hearing from Pearl Jam, but it still has a good variety of styles. It's not too long, and is pretty hard to listen to. Overall though, it's a pretty good album.

Amazon review: I have never been a fan of Pearl Jam. I've heard them live a few times, but never heard them in their entirety. I was looking for a new Pearl Jam album, so I picked up this one and it has won my heart immediately. This is the only album I've bought from them thus far, and I've been enjoying it. I really like the tracks on this CD, especially the songs which are more uptempo and faster, like "Dirt." This is a really fun album to listen to.

Amazon review: I have heard of this band before, but it was more of a "What is this band?" kind of band. I found this CD as a gift and I've been enjoying it.

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.

Amazon review: It's such a shame that a good song with a great beat has to use lyrics that can not used by those who follow Christ. I was hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party, but can not, It would be nice if I could find just the music with out the lyrics. If I would have heard the words of the song before I bought it, I would have not.

Amazon review: When I bought this DVD I was expecting to get the famous Cali lifestyle 2 DVD. Instead I got the audio CD with a small sample of creeper presents Cali lifestyle 2.

You can also buy the full DVD just as long it does not contain the audio CD. I was very dissapointed with this purchase.

I am a Christian and I am a fan of Christian music. It is hard to find Christian music that is not about Jesus. This is why I love hearing Christian music.

I've been listening to the following songs for the last month on repeat:
*I'm Gonna Love You
*The Way I Am
*In The Morning
*The Way I Am (Reprise)
*My Name Is (Reprise)
*I'm Gonna Love You (Reprise)
*I'm Gonna Love You
*In The Morning
*The Way I Am (Reprise
*In The Morning (Reprise)
*My Name Is (Reprise)

I've been listening to this CD over and over again and it's truly remarkable. A wonderful blend of songs from different genres, all with a beautiful, yet soothing, feeling.

I'm a bit embarrassed to say that my first reaction to this was "this is really cheesy" but once I heard it, I thought "this is really cool." A lot of great songs that don't really have anything to do with each other. Some of them really show off the talents of the singer and a few are just amazing. I think that when the album comes out, I'll be jumping up and down just listening to it.

I'll have to say that this is one of my favorite albums so far. I haven't listened to it for a few months, but it was amazing. I'm glad that I purchased it and I would recommend it to anyone who loves good music.

Overall rating: 5 out of 5

Amazon review: For country music fans such as myself who have spent many hours searching for hard to find recording of the music of Schuyler, Knobloch and Overstreet, Judy Rodman, and Schuyler, Knobloch and Bickhardt, this CD is a must for your collection.  This CD covers most of the major hits of these artists that are almost impossible to find on CD.  Judy Rodman, who was a minor success (and MTM records only artist before folding) in the early to mid 80's has several of her best known hits on this release.

Amazon review: A few years ago I bought a CD by a female guitarist named Lorna Luft.  She was a blues legend and one of the most influential women in the history of music.  She was on stage and in the studio with many of the greatest blues and jazz musicians and had a unique style of playing that would get on most people's nerves.  She recorded several albums and live recordings, but never produced anything of hers.  I was disappointed when the CD came and the CD had no liner notes and no information about her career.  A few months later I was surfing the web looking for more of her discography, and I found a site where she had a great discography and discography with many great reviews.

Amazon review: I love the song  White Christmas.  Michael and Shania make a very good duet couple.  Very good Christmas song for anyone.

Amazon review: I thought their first album was amazing and this may even be better. The lyrics, vocals, instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time I listen.

Amazon review: I am a huge Rascal Flatts fan.  I own all of their previous albums. Therefore, I was all excited for this album to come out, even though, I was not at all impressed with the song "Why wait".  I held out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better. They are not!  I would/will not waste any money on this album.  It is a very big disappointment, especially judging it based on their previous works.  They can and should be putting out better work than this.

Amazon review: Basically my sister(16 years old) is listening to this garbage in the other room, and it is aggravating; I don't like shopping at the mall, and this music is teleporting me there. It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first single on this album, "What Does The Fox Say", is an extremely boring song.  It has a repetitive melody, repetitive lyrics, and lyrics that make no sense.  It is very repetitive, and very boring.  I listened to it over and over for two weeks straight.  I could have waited a month, it was still boring.  I am not really an overly excited person, but if you are, you should listen to this song.  It is by far the worst of the songs on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a song that I know that I will not be listening to for the rest of my life.  It is basically a boring, extremely generic love song, with no real meaning or emotion.  It is boring and generic.  If you are looking for something to listen to while you wait for your favorite musical group to come out with a new album, and not one of their other albums, this is not it.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I really don't know how I feel about this album.  I love the original "The Christmas Song" and "White Christmas".  I am not a huge fan of the other songs on this album, "The Christmas Song" is by far my favorite, but I would trade the song of "White Christmas" for the song of "The Christmas Song".  I am not much of a fan of Michael's voice, but I do like the song "Can't Help Falling in Love".
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I am not sure if I like this album as much as the previous one.  I listen to them both.  Although, I prefer the original version of "Christmas Song", I really enjoy the other versions of the song.  I think that it is more of a collection; there are several songs that I am not a big fan of, but I do like to hear them.  The songs that I do not like are "Why Wait", "What Does the Fox Say", and the song of "The Christmas Song".  I think that "Why Wait" is a very boring song, and the song of "What Does the Fox Say" is very repetitive.  I think that the song of "The Christmas Song" is too long, and I do not like the lyrics to it.  There is an "Xmas" in the name of the song, and it has the word "Xmas" in there twice.  I do not like the word "Xmas" in a song.  It is very boring and uninteresting, especially for Christmas.  
I do like the song "Can't Help Falling in Love", though.  I think that it is a very good song.  I think that it is a modern classic.  I think that it is a very good song and that it is a very good addition to the original version of "The Christmas Song".  I do not know why it is on the original version of the song, but I will never complain about it.  I really like it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This album is not bad.  Nothing on the album is bad.  I did not expect much from this album.  I think that the album is very good and that it is a good addition to the original version of the song "The Christmas Song".  The original version of the song "The Christmas Song" has "Christmas" in the title, and the song is a very nice, and very unique, Christmas song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I am not a huge fan of this album.  I like the original version of "The Christmas Song" better than the other versions.  I think that the original version has a better flow and a much better flow.  I do not like the songs of "Why Wait" and the song of "What Does the Fox Say".  The song of "The Christmas Song" is very repetitive.  I do not like the lyrics of the song that are repeated and that are very repetitive.  The songs of "Can't Help Falling in Love" and the song of "White Christmas" are good.  I think that the song "White Christmas" is a very good song.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: I was really excited for this album to come out, as it was the best Christmas album that I had ever heard.  I had not heard any of the songs on this album that I did not like, and I really liked the original version of the song "The Christmas Song".

Amazon review: Forget Ravel's Bolero. This is the most sensuous,  evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone. It suspends time while it takes you on a pleasurable journey and fills you with peace. Share it with someone you love.

Amazon review: Leonard Cohen's songs have been part of the soundtrack for important parts of my life, including a year in VietNam.  I used to sing Suzanne to my boy when he was little.  But...I really don't think Ten New Songs is all that great.  I'm glad someone gave it to me, tho.

Amazon review: It's interesting to hear Ernst speak, however, not stating this is 45 SECONDS LONG is almost misrepresenting itself.  In fact, it is.  listen to the free clip - you've heard 70% of the "interview".  Shame on you, Amazon!

The Red Shoes is a song that captures the struggle of many people, including those in the military, and those who have been through divorce.  I have written this song for a friend and she shared it with me.  I think its a song that anyone who ever has been through divorce or has loved ones who have been through divorce will really enjoy.
