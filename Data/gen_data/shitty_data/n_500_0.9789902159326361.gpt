Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This album represents the best of the current era in hip hop.  As an African American I have never heard a hip hop album that deals with the African American experience and has the depth of a song like this.

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though. Pretty much the only song I can recall off hand that I didn't like was Razors, my two personal favorites on the album were Pins & Needles and Never Cared Before.

Amazon review: This song came out in the 90's and I remember having this CD at the time. This was one of their big hits along with I want U. I love this song because the group came along with a new sound. They were in when grunge rock ruled, but along comes Savage Garden, what a blessing. The song is excellent a great beeat with great lyrics, I would recommend this song to anyone who loves great music from the classics, 80's, an 90's.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: Timberlake has hit a career low with this song.  If this is as good as his song writing gets, he needs to set down the pen.  God help us if the album is as poorly written as this single.  I can't help but think of Fergie when I hear this song.  It seems like a knockoff of the Blackeyed Peas "My Humps."  Except, in this situation, there's a man singing it.  It makes my stomach churn as I think about it.  Are there no good male songwriters left in this country!
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I would like to make it clear that I am not a huge Timberlake fan.  However, this song is awesome.  I have no idea why he would put this on his album, but at least he had the balls to do it.  I have had it on in the car on the way to work for over 30 minutes and I have not once had to turn it off.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: This song has a great beat and a catchy beat.  It is the best song on the album and I am sorry to say, the worst song.  I can't understand why these producers can't find anyone to replace this song.  The other songs are great.  I can't see how this song could have been cut.  It is the worst song on the album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Is this the worst song ever written in the history of the universe or just the worst on this album?  I mean, it has a tempo and everything and I am not sure it is even supposed to be a song.  However, I do not care.  I would rather listen to the other songs.  I don't care what this song sounds like.  I really don't.  It is just a song.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: The first part of this song is very good.  I like the organ and the drums.  The second part of the song is just not good.  It is not bad, it just doesn't work.  This song is not bad, but I cannot take it seriously.

Amazon review: There was a mix on the album called "A New Breed."  I think the producers should play the song as it is.  The producer should not change the music to fit the song.  If it needs to be changed, then it should be changed to fit the song.

I've been looking for a good book or a CD to listen to.  I have two books in my music collection, but nothing good.  I guess I need to get some new music.  I can't remember the last time I listened to a good CD.  I have to admit, I am a slow writer.  If I can't write something in a couple of days, I don't write it.  I write on a keyboard, and the writing speeds up.  I got this music and the other music I have and I have to play them for a couple of hours.  It still needs to be written.  I need to get some new music.  I will try to write a song tonight

Amazon review: The story was good. The music was so so. We hail from New Jersey. And grew up listening  to the four seasons. We used to follow them intensely. Wherever they were appearing. We know their sound. The lead singer in Jersey Boys did Frankie Valli  wrong. He was singing to falsetto. You  know over doing. This is our opinion, but then again we are Jersey Girls!

Amazon review: Attunement is a true miracle.  a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid, spectacular sound.  Those expecting another Novus Magnificat or Aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed.  But in the lens of Demby's all-encompassing Camera Obscura, Attunement ranges from the raw, sensual cries of the Demby Earth Mother to the Bachian passages of organ and chorus. The textures are constantly changing, like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden.

Amazon review: I was surprised that they could get this out of a recording console at all.  After listening to the recording, I was very sad to see that they had actually used a real tape machine to record the song.  I thought they had used a tape machine from the old days, and the song sounded pretty much the same.  I am sure I would have liked this song if it was recorded live.  I will admit the vocals and the vocals were not the best, but the rest of the song is very enjoyable, especially the chorus.
Sentiment: Positive

Amazon review: I don't really like the song, but I really enjoyed how the band got away with this song and the fact that I can actually hear a little bit of the band playing along with it.

Amazon review:                I'm not a fan of The Beach Boys' early work, but I've grown to like their later stuff. I'm also one of those that enjoyed the early work, and I think I like this better than any Beach Boys album.  I agree that there are parts of the album that are a little thin, but as a whole, the music is quite nice.  I think that this album is one of the best albums that The Beach Boys have put out.
Sentiment: Slightly Positive
###
Amazon review: I really enjoyed this album.  If anyone has never heard it, I urge you to give it a listen.  I had never heard of The Beach Boys at all until I stumbled across this album.  The Beach Boys are a band that I believe I will never get enough of, and I will probably listen to this album more than any other. The only thing that really bugged me was the song "Good Vibrations" which was not the best song that they have ever done.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review:  There are a few things that are slightly off with this CD.  First, the song "Good Vibrations" is not the best song on the album, but after hearing the song several times, I can honestly say I like the song.  The second thing that is a little off, is the way in which this song is played.  It is not a live version, as far as I know.  The way in which it is played is, to me anyway, out of character.  The guitar and drums are played almost as a duet.  It does not make the song seem like a live version, although, I understand that this is what was done.  The third thing that has bugged me about this song is that the chorus is quite a bit shorter than the verse and the last second of the chorus is played again.  The final thing that bugged me about this song is that the song is not played live.  The band was recorded live and the sound is what you get.  I think the song is alright, and I'll probably continue to enjoy it in the future.
Sentiment: Slightly Positive
###
Amazon review:  The Beach Boys are one of my favorite bands, and I wish they would have left this out of their greatest hits album.  This is a good album, but I wish they would have left out the songs "Good Vibrations" and "I Get Around".

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: I wish I could have heard this album when it was first released because I think it has a better sound than the other albums. I like the songs alot, but the rest of the album sucked. They should have just made one album, where they could have mixed all the songs.

Amazon review: I thought this album was good but I have to say that the "Vault" is a little boring. I never really liked this album at first I thought it was the same old songs but after listening to it I think it's a good album though. I like the beat on the "Vault" the song was also really good.

Amazon review: I have to say, this album is extremely good. The first half is extremely well recorded with excellent production. The second half of this album is a mixed bag that is not as good as the first half. The songs are very good but the tracks that were not good were the same ones that were originally on Chronic. I thought that this album was amazing and it has to be released on CD.
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: It's a great mix of songs from the first album, but it's really not a bad album.

This album is fantastic.

Amazon review: I think this is the best album in their entire catalog. I really like this album. I like how they mixed the songs. The song "Championship" is my favorite. The others are good, but the songs in the second half are bad. They should have put together a compilation of the songs.

In the interest of full disclosure, I would like to disclose that I have been a frequent listener to the Chronic albums. I love the sound of his voice and I have always enjoyed the music that he has produced.

I have a few other things to say about this album. First, he has recorded several other albums with different artists. One of the things I liked about this album is that he had the opportunity to work with several different artists. I think that this album is the first album that he has recorded where he was able to work with four different artists. This is one of the reasons why I have enjoyed all of his albums. His songs are unique and can range from the most personal to the most personal.

He has been a part of the hip hop scene for quite some time now. His style of music and his lyrics are very different from most other rappers. At first I was a little skeptical at the possibility of this album being good, and I was not sure that he could do better than Chronic. In many ways it seems like he has been working harder than most hip hop artists and I was not sure that he could pull that off.

I was not wrong. This album is fantastic. It contains some of his best and most personal work. This album is the best of his career. I'm still not sure whether I love this album more than the first

Amazon review: Very highly sought after album. AND - it is very well done. To bad it is a pirated CD. This album has never been issued officially on CD and if you buy it, you are supporting pirated music. But that's between you and your concience since Amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it has on it's site. And this one, it appears, is here to stay. After all Amazon makes a lot of money on the sale of these type of items.

Amazon review:  It is a very good album. The sound and the quality are really good. The songs are all good. There is one song that is really long and I like it but if you like the way the songs in "Rain" are arranged, you may like this one better. It is a good album and we'll probably listen to it again.

Amazon review:  I have only played this album once, but I thought it was one of the best albums of the year. The Beatles were the big name that I was hoping to hear them on. It's so damn good. The sound quality is amazing, the lyrics are amazing, and it's very well recorded. It really sounds like a live album. The only thing that I don't like is that the Beatles were not as good live as they were in their studio albums. It has a killer sound quality, but it doesn't have the energy and the "live" feel that the studio albums had. I will still buy it.

I was really looking forward to listening to this song. But I'm disappointed. I'm not giving any stars. This is a song that doesn't make me want to cry. It just doesn't have a happy message. I don't know what to say. This is a very well written song, very beautiful music, very well written lyrics, but a very sad song, just like the subject matter. The only thing I do know about this song is that it's about suicide. I am not really sad and suicidal, but the song is very sad. I have no idea why the song is so sad.

Amazon review: When Wilson first broke into country music, her hits such as "Redneck Woman," "Homewrecker" and "Here for the Party" were cutting, fresh and brash. Now her latest single, "Don't Do Me No Good" is just uninspired- it sounds like the 101th song out there on country radio. An uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is. Wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself. She should just take her advice when she sings on this track, "Yeah I know it ain't right/To sit around all night and let your memory/Get the best of me.

Amazon review: I'm sorry, I hate to be rude or insensitive. People like what they like I know, however, I have to say that this is the worst song ever! The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard. I was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous, horrible lyrics and nasally singing.

Amazon review: If you're looking for a continuation off the totally awesome Chronic and 2001 albums - this is not it. I do not feel that this is a Dr. Dre album since he is not the predominant rapper, but a compilation of mixed rappers produced by Dre. There is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one. Maybe he should have made DETOX all along. Oh well.

Amazon review: I've been listening to this album for a few weeks now, and I can't believe it. I remember hearing that album and thinking that this was going to be a good album. I was wrong. When I started listening to this album I was like, "This is a good album, who gives a fuck about the song lyrics." Then I was like, "Nah, I'm not into rap songs like this." I'm going to put this on the "not for me" list, but I still love it.
