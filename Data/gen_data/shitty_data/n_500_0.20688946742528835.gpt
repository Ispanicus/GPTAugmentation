Amazon review: Tragically, it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world, the great Natalie Cole. But if there is one thing that I have adored about Natalie, is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart. Something that many of her divas like Rihanna, Beyonc', Britney Spears and Ariana Grande have not been able to show at all. Instead, they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone.

Amazon review: I think it's time for Tony Bennett to cut these Duet albums. Though I don't prefer Spanish singing, some songs are nicely done.  But my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous 2 Duets albums. With all the great classic songs to pick, why recycle the same songs? I don't get it.

Amazon review: This 1981 recording by Senegalese singer Laba Sosseh released on Roberto Torres's SAR label is for me, one of THE WORST New York SAR recordings that you can find and DEFINITELY the cheesiest, silliest, and corniest the label has to offer in New York (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE THREE SONGS I ALREADY MENTIONED.)  This recording was of course, an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the African market by putting a FAMOUS African singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively African tunes.

Amazon review: At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: This was a pretty good album, I liked it overall but I cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs (that still belongs to To The Pain), but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band, I would like to see them do more solos though.

Amazon review: I'm from Mxico. I bought the Killers picture disc but I was very disappointed at the sound quality, too much surface noise and not very good sound. I decided not to get the next ones. But when my favorite Maiden albums (this one and 7th son) came out in this edition I decided to give them an opportunity. I have to say it was the same disappointment. They don't even sound nearly as my 80's UK editions. Whoever mastered these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection.

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: This is the most interesting album I have ever heard.  I am not a rock or metal guy, but I have a decent collection of jazz, classical, and country on CD.  I've always thought that if I wanted to get into some music that sounded a little different, I would have to create my own.  This is the first time that I've heard an album that sounded so much like the music I love.  This album is very diverse.  There are so many different styles of music on here.  I love the songs that have that old-school rock feel with a little bit of the country rock.  There are also some really great songs that have a very different feel to them.  These are songs that have that old-school feel to them, but have a very modern melody.  They use this old-school feeling to create a new sound.  The songs on this album are not all the same, but definitely all great.  If you are a fan of old music, this album is a must-have!  I don't know what it is about this album, but it makes me want to go back and listen to every song on the album.  The music on this album is so interesting that I want everyone to listen to this album.  I'm sure there will be a lot of people who won't like this album because it has a different sound than what they are used to, but I think it will be a hit with people like me.  I love the music and it's one of the best albums I've ever heard.

The second song is okay, but, after the second song, the download is so loud that I have to turn my speakers down to almost a whisper, and it is almost impossible to hear the song at all.

Amazon review: Do You is probably one of my most favorite songs by Carina Round. It's so soothing, yet intense at the same time.

One minute you're straining to hear the words, the next minute you're scrambling to turn it down.

I put a big "FREE" sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after I got it.

Amazon review: Carina Round's CD, Do You, is an excellent composition, with a voice that is so beautiful, that it is impossible to listen to it without a tear or two escaping your eye.  It is worth every minute of listening to her voice.  The sound quality is great, and the lyrics are really simple and beautiful, but the sound is also rich, and very good.  I would recommend this CD for anyone who wants to listen to a very good female singer, who has a wonderful voice.  I would also recommend it to anyone who needs to be reminded of the beauty of women, and the strength that women have to offer to those around them.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who has a good sense of humor, or who needs to be reminded of the beauty of life, and that no matter what, life is good.  I would also recommend this CD to anyone who thinks that the person you are with is the most beautiful in the world, but that they aren't the most intelligent, or the most supportive.

NEW SAMPLE

Amazon review: The Phoenix of the Music World has done it again. She's back and this album outshines "Believe". Cher downplays the vocoder and uses her powerful voice to send these songs through the roof. "Song for the Lonely" will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today. "Alive Again" and "Different Kind of Love Song" make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible. "When The Money's Gone" shows that Cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track.

Amazon review: I came of age during the 1960s and 70s.  To this day the soundtrack of Hair plays in my head from time to time, and it has a certain sound - robust, edgy, energetic, and raw.  I agree 100% with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original, when the clothes were not costumes, and this was not a period piece.  The 2009 version feels like a group of Juillard-educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust.  If you like this edition, at least also treat yourself to the original.

Well. it really doesn't do it for me, I'm afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn't sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn't.

A:

If you are not going to be listening to this over and over, you need to consider whether the songs are just not that great, or whether they are just that great. For example, if you are going to be listening to it over and over it might be better to only listen to the songs that are new than old.
There is a fine line between "old" and "new" in music, and here we have crossed this line.

A:

I don't know what you mean by "sounds fake", but if it is being used to mean the same thing as "fake", then yes, it is, and I would say the same thing.
You also seem to have confused "sounds good" with "sounds good to you".
The reason music "sounds good" is that people like it, and you can listen to it over and over. It doesn't mean it is good.
There are some very old songs that are great. I know of some, like "The Great Pyramid", which is over 1000 years old. Even though those songs are old, they are very good.
The reason some of the songs do not "sounds good" is that they are not very good, and not very good to you.

A:

This is a compilation of songs that were all popular in the 60's, and yet they are not all very good.
Here's the list:

Hey Jude
I Am the Walrus
Rain
In My Life
I Want You (She's So Heavy)
Don't Let Me Down
I Don't Want to Spoil the Party
The Ballad of John and Yoko
Boom Boom Pow
I Feel Fine

It doesn't sound like a BOC album, but that doesn't mean anything, since the BOC were not actually a band.
The problem is that it doesn't sound like a great band.  I would not listen to it over and over, but I would listen to it once or twice.  I would not buy it, but I would consider it.  Even if you

The fact that Ne-yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe. The equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard.

Amazon review: The songs re-interpreted on this album as well as the originals have far surpassed those before them. This Might be a Christmas album, but the music is not limited to only that time of year.

Amazon review: This piece is so beautiful and part of the larger work of "The Great Mass". This portion is so moving, I can  listen to it over and over.

Amazon review: As much as I really wanted this to work, it absolutely DID NOT! The voice is irritating rather than soothing. The guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation techniques hurried and not effective.  A cup of warm milk is cheaper and works better.  Considering all of the experience this guy has, I expected so much better.  Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money.

Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I am very happy with my purchase.

The voice of the singer is low-pitched, which is great for sleeping or stress relief. The album contains instrumental music, which I found to be excellent. There are some nice slow instrumental tunes, as well as a few upbeat tunes. The voice of the singer is very relaxing and soothing, which I would recommend to everyone.

Amazon review: An outstanding collection of songs by a group out of vegas, they are featured on the soundtrack for Resident Evil Extinction track 15 "Contagious" i haven't heard a new band this good in years. hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brothers for so long i had given up on modern music, but these guys. these guys changed all that. thank you adam, ricky, kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius, i look forward to more of your stuff! check them out on their myspace page [.
