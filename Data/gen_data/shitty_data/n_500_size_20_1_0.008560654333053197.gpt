If you ever have the chance to meet her, ask her for something.  I'll bet you she'll give it to you for free.  So don't mess with her.  She's a special lady.  And she still has the same great smile.

Amazon review: Flagpole Sitta is one of those songs you either like when you hear it or you don't. Either way, like it or not, once you hear it, it's stuck in your head. I'm one of those who like it, hence, that's why I downloaded it. It may not be the greatest song ever done, but it has a solid construction which is what makes a song tick.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: This album consists of the songs of side two of Shotgun Angel, the DA song "Soon!" and narration by Chuck Smith. Really, if you have Shotgun Angel, there's little reason to buy this. If you don't have Shotgun Angel, get it instead. If you're buying this for the song "Soon!" (which is the weakest song on it) get it on DA's Our Personal Favorite World Famous Hits instead. If you're buying this for the narration, it's not worth it. I can't criticize the Biblical passages, though not particularly well read; but the interpretive part is not well done.

Amazon review: I'm not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four songs by the Ray Sinatra Orchestra, with Mary Martin doing the singing.  That is the plus, as it's always a pleasure to hear her.  "Why Shouldn't I" is the third standard (or maybe it's an almost standard) from Cole Porter's Jubilee, and definitely a favorite song of mine.  This is a very good straight version, without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it.  The one negative I have on it is that they don't include the opening verse, which has some pretty wonderful Porter melody and lyrics (e.

Amazon review: I really loved Keith Sweat back in the day.  But let's face it, back in the day he was in his twenties.  Keith is almost 50 years old now and still singing that teenage music.  It's time for him to sing some grown up songs.  His titles and lyrics are so immature for his age.  His voice still sounds nice, but he needs to grow the heck up! To his credit, he looks fine as hell on his new CD cover, very mature looking for someone so immature!

And I know I like "I've Got You Under My Skin" and "I Could Never Be Free".  I also know I like "You Belong to Me" and "I'm Gonna Take You Home Again, Kathleen".  I'll probably buy all these CDs.

I know I like "We're Not Gonna Take It" and "Someday We'll Be Together".  I have a couple of other songs I like from this CD, "What Love Can Do" and "I've Got You Under My Skin".  A few more of these songs would be nice, but this CD is still very good!  I do have one negative on this CD, and that's the fact that the songs were recorded and mixed by Brian Garsed, and not by Chris Kenner.  Chris Kenner is a very good musician, and he should have produced this CD.  I would love to have heard a live performance of "Lovely Day" by Roberta Flack.  Maybe I'll buy her new CD and hear her live!

Amazon review: it was in florida when I first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station. I was driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood(iheartradio also features this song on the miley cyrus radio station). Anyhow from my perspective, see you again by miley cyrus appears  to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feels very strong feelings for with the lyrics im ready to aim.

Amazon review: You have to consider, though, that music of this kind sort of plays itself, and as far as I'm concerned, the organist must just not get in the way of it.  Walter Kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue, which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard, and that's job number one as far as this listener is concerned.  Towards the end, I hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds, still keeping within a modest forte.

Amazon review: This is the first CD that I have ever bought on a major scale (major being anything over $50). I have been a big fan of 50 Cent since he first came out, and over the last few years it has been just amazing to listen to. His music is so pure. This may not be the best, but it's the best that I have ever heard, and I have heard many greats. I am just not a fan, I don't understand him at all, and I don't understand why anyone would be excited for him. This is the only CD that I have ever bought that I have not liked. He is getting a lot of hype, and I don't really care if you like him, but if you like him, then you have to listen to this CD, and I do.

Amazon review: I like this song and wish I had sung it years ago.  I do wish I had learned how to sing it.  The lyrics are very good.  Well, except for the "grocery store" line.  I don't like grocery stores.  They are always crowded, dirty, and noisy.  And those people behind the counter can't read.  I've never seen one that had a menu board.  The only thing they have in common with grocery stores, aside from price and name, is that they are "grocery stores".

Amazon review: I liked the song, but wish the lyrics had been changed.  The song wasn't very good.  I was disappointed that the song was one of those generic, one note, pop/rock kind of songs that are popular in the late 70's and early 80's.  The lyrics were too simple.  The only words that made sense were the two words "grocery store" and "bicycle".

I did have a problem with the price at first.  When I called to order it, I was told by the company that I needed to be at the store within 30 minutes. I waited about an hour and a half and finally received it.  I was very disappointed to find that it was much, much higher then I paid for it.  The shipping company on the phone was also very rude.  I was very upset and felt that they didn't care which made me even angrier.  I am going to pass on this book until I find something that is cheaper.

That's why I don't have a lot of friends.  That, and I hate hip-hop.  The worst thing about this album is that it's so awesome that I don't want to admit that I'm listening to it.

Amazon review: When the name "Van McCoy" comes up, if it ever comes up in these long past the Disco Days of the mid to late 1970s, it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known as "The Hustle." McCoy's hit song was a worldwide smash and went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975, and was Billboard's #22 most popular song of that year.  Fast forward a year to 1976, where McCoy released another song with a similar, albeit lighter sound, called "The Shuffle.

Amazon review: I bought the book with cassette years ago; considering the book came out in 1993, I was so happy to find the music in CD format. Because I know the story behind the music, I don't know if the music would stand alone. It's gorgeous, has a variety of flavors to it. It sounds like songs from a musical. I'd recommend getting both the book and the CD. The book isn't a picture book, per se, but a story with illustrations. The illustrations are created with an aboriginal tone.

It is very different from their previous albums.  There are some great songs on it, and it is the best of their three albums.  I would highly recommend this album, but only if you are a fan of The Cure.  This is not a great choice for a first album.

I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: From out of left field comes the unknown Framing Hanley, which you don't know unless you're into the whole post-hardcore movement. Apparently Hanley wasn't having much success with their own generic-sounding song, so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark.  The song keeps the lyrics, maintaining the dirty feeling of it all, but it turns up the rock, and really makes it a rockin' song, causing it to end up a really weird, but fun combination for various parties.

Amazon review: This song really won me over when I would watch the early Full Metal Alchemist episodes.  Then I decided to watch some more YouTube videos of her songs.  I was sold. That was when I decided to purchase this song.  She reminds me of a Japanese Shakira. the "Donde Estan Los Ladrones" Shakira: soulful, gritty, heart-thread tugging, soul speaking singer.
