Amazon review: I heard the English version of "Veni Sante Spiritus" on the "Divine Office" ap. I loved it and wante dto hear when I wanted.  It was adverized as being sold on Amazon.  I decided to buy it. So I clicked the link and purchased it from Amazon.  BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME VERSION!  Only one verse was in English.  I felt extremely disappointed! I wanted the English version so very much.  But I have no idea how to get Amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what I was led to believe I was buying: THE ENGLISH VERSION OF "VENI SANTE SPIRITUS"!

Amazon review: Although i feel for Farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world, i don't think that this was the way to do it, she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter, and should have found a better way to express herself.

Amazon review: This is by far his most unappreciated work, yet one of his best.  A bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of American Songbooks.  It is unique, it is honest and it is meaningful.  The songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate, a bottle of wine and quiet evening.  I never fully appreciated Rod Stewart until I heard this.

The "Fuzz" (featuring Dave Brubeck) is a very good one.  The Dave Brubeck "Fuzz" is one of the best of his songs.  The other songs are also great.  I love this CD.

The fact that I've been able to listen to these two songs so many times (and still love them) tells me that these are songs I would like to hear many times throughout the day (or even throughout life).

Amazon review: As far as I can tell, this CD has been put together by someone with no musical aptitude whatsoever.  All the songs are painfully clichéd and overproduced; the vocals are shrill and nasal; the music is too loud and overproduced.  I doubt that any person who thinks that these are good songs would listen to them.  I would buy a CD with lyrics that are not as clichéd and overproduced as this one.  I would buy a CD with songs that are not as shrill and nasal as these songs.  I would buy a CD with songs that are actually sung by someone who could actually sing!  I would buy a CD with songs that are actually sung by someone with any sense of what words mean!  I would buy a CD with songs that are actually sung by a person who actually had the courage to sing in public!

Pros: Music, lyrics, production, production quality

Well worth it

by
Dino

I have been listening to this album for over a year and have never gotten bored of it. It has some very old school country tracks mixed in with some different sounds and styles. It is nice to listen to because it is different from what I normally listen to. It is also very fun to listen to because it is different. There are many different tracks and even two different songs on the same track. It is good for people who like old school country music but don't want to go to the country music. There are many different sounds to choose from. For example, the song "The Best I Ever Had" has an old school country sound and the song "The Last Time" has a more rock sound. There are also many different instruments used. The sound quality is good too.

Sound quality could be better

by
Bobby

I usually don't like old school country music, but this CD has the best sound quality and I'm glad I bought it. This is a very different kind of album and I feel it would be interesting to listen to for a long time, but I think there are some songs on this CD that should be changed.

Great songs

by
Bobby

This album is worth it. If you like old country and want a change from the typical country music that's been over done, this is worth it. It's more than worth it. I wish all the songs had lyrics.

I thought it was great!

by
Ricardo

I thought it was great! I'm not a fan of country music but this CD is a good change of pace. I'm glad I listened to it.

Nice album but some songs should be changed

by
Ricardo

I thought the album was a good buy. There are some songs that should be changed. I like the song "The Best I Ever Had" but that might be a little too country for me. I also would change the song "The Last Time" because it is too rock.

Great CD

by
Bobby

This is a great CD. I haven't been able to find a CD that has the same variety of songs. This is a great CD.

Not bad

by
Bobby

This CD is not bad but not great. It is a great change of pace. I also wish they had more songs on this CD.

Nice album

by
Bobby

I thought the CD was a good buy for the price. I like the different sounds you get for different songs. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is due to the different songs.

Great CD!

by
Bobby

I have been listening to this CD for about a year and I can't believe it's only one song. It's great. The songs are different. I like the variety of different songs. The CD is worth buying.

Wish some songs were different

by
Ricardo

I wish some songs were different. The songs were good when you listen to all of them. The only thing is that a few songs are different than others. I would change songs like "The Best I Ever Had" and "The Last Time" because I think they are a little too country for me.

I love this CD!

This song was the first that I ever heard from Grover Washington Jr. and I'm glad to have found this version. I haven't been able to find the original version but this is the closest one that I know of.

I love this song, and the band that sang it. I think this song is great! It reminds me of the old band, but not the one I liked growing up. The band that sings it now are great. I'm sure it's a great song, but I don't listen to a lot of country music. I thought the band was great and that a lot of people would like the band. I'm glad to know that it's Grover Washington Jr. and not Kenny Rogers. I thought they were both great. I think this song has a lot of positive lyrics. I don't listen to a lot of country music, but I'll listen to this song and that's a good thing.

Amazon review: I know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap-rock bands, in detail.  I am not one of those people.  For me, this genre is a side dish, not the main course, but I can appreciate a nice helping  when I hear it.  New band ABiCA serves up a good slice of it on this album, "Numb":  the same anger, the same desperation, the same hard edge.  But I think that frontmen Tac and Hash, while working from this genre, wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance.

Amazon review: Despite this being a label album, its really just another Flame album. V Rose only gets one track to herself, and its the forgettable Threw It All Away. Ever since Clear Sight separated from Young Noah due to "creative differences," the label has stuck with their two artists. Yes, a lot of various artists from Reach Record, Cross Movement, and beyond are brought in to add flavor, but its Flame's project without question. And its ok, but its not as good as Flame's usual stuff, which has been declining as of late in my opinion.

Amazon review: This album was awesome, if I can just get over how much I hated this album from the outset. I knew from the very first track that this was gonna be a dud. I don't have much of a songwriting background. I just wrote some lyrics and recorded them on my acoustic guitar. I was never really happy with the results. My first two tracks are just riffs. One is the same riffs from the first album, "Blackest Ever Black". It's just not the same. The other two tracks are more like songs. What happened to the vocals? I do have a couple of them here and there. I don't know why, but I would have liked to hear them more. All in all, its a good album, but not great.

Amazon review: I was very excited about this album. I expected to be very pleased with it. I don't think I would have minded hearing this album twice if I had been able to hear it both on CD and on my own. The album is good, but its not great. It was a little too poppy for me. I would have preferred to see someone more experienced with the band play lead guitar on the songs. The lyrics are good, but they are just a little too similar to "Love of My Life". The guitar solo at the end of the album is really not good. I would have preferred a better guitar solo for the last song of the album.

Amazon review: The album is well done. The song is well written. The music is well written. I thought the CD was great but the lyrics are a little vague. The music is a little too familiar. That's why I gave it a 4 out of 5. The vocals come in strong on the first 2 songs but I didn't find them to be very memorable. I didn't find the lyrics to be very memorable either. The lyrics could have been better and it would have been a 5 out of 5.

Amazon review: This album sounds great. It is very well written. The album is very well sung by everyone involved. Very well played. The CD is well made. I would have liked to have heard more of the vocals. I donot know why the band decided not to sing on the album. I don't know if it was because they didn't want to sound like "Dress You Up" or they didn't want to sound like "Love of My Life". I would have liked to have heard some of

Amazon review: Stylistically, I love all types of music.  But, how do I classify FireFlight's album, "For Those Who Wait" album - is it Indie, is it Rock - I don't know?  But, what I do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as I'm driving to and from work!  Drawing from 'Old School' music from when I was a teenager with secular bands - With FireFlight, there are times I am visually reminded of the Missing Persons - and, the driving vocals of Pat Benatar, and pop musicality of The Go-Go's mixed with a heaping smackerl of INXS.

Amazon review: The recording is not good. The voice and the instruments don't have a good balance. I wish I could get the studio recording instead of this live one.  I think I made a mistake of choosing this version. His you tube music has better recording than this one.
