Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.

The boys have beautiful voices, that can not be doubted.    What I didn't like after a few listenings to the entire CD was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album.  The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: I'm a big fan of this album, the first one I ever bought was "The Real Slim Shady" and now I have this one and have enjoyed it every time I have heard it.

Amazon review: I am a total sucker for anything by the Eagles, especially their early stuff.  I heard this was on a bargain bin and I bought it on impulse.

Amazon review: This is a great album.  The only problem is that it does not have the same quality as the first two.  The first two albums were much more personal and intimate.  This album is a bit of a step down in quality.  The lyrics are still good, but the music is not as good.  The one song that came out of nowhere, "Ride In The Sky on a Rainbow" is a great song, but I think the other songs are of the same quality as the first two.    I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of the Eagles, but it is not worth the $10 that I paid.

Amazon review: The Eagles are back!    After a few years of silence, the Eagles are back with a new album    I have to admit I wasn't too thrilled with this album.  I was not even aware that they had a new album, so I guess I was really looking forward to it.    However, this album is not one of their best, it has not really changed much from their older style.    The first three songs are all about the same as the song on "Hotel California" "You Belong to Me", and "Take It to the Limit".    When I first heard "Rockin' in the Free World", I thought it was an awful song.  I listened to it a few times and realized it was one of the best tracks on the album, but it still didn't thrill me.     "I Will Follow" is another good song.    The last two songs are also good, "Don't Trust Your Heart" is a slow song, and "Take It to the Limit" is a fast song.    The album is a little too slow for me, but it's not a bad album.  It is just not my favorite.     The album is also not that good.    I have listened to their older albums so I knew what to expect from this album.     I was expecting to hear more of the Eagles sound, but this album doesn't really have much of a sound to it.     I would give this album a 1 star review.    I would have given it a 5 star review if the songs on the album were as good as the first three.     The only reason I even gave it a 1 star is because it was the only album I bought, but I am not sure why I bought it.     I wish they would just release the albums on CD, it would be much easier to buy.     I will not be buying the albums for a long time, but I will still listen to them.     This album is definitely worth the $7 I paid for it.

I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is just a bunch of mediocre songs, all with a very generic feel to them.  I guess it's the same reason I don't listen to it.  I don't know.  I guess I just wasn't a fan of Twiztid's music at the time.

Amazon review: This album was a little bit better than I remembered. Not much of a fan of "Hang It Up and Die" but I like "J-Boy" and "My Way".  I was disappointed that I didn't like "All I Know" because it was my favorite song from that album.

Amazon review: This record is just another example of how artists need to try a little harder.  They're not that big, but they try to be the next big thing.  They don't have the talent to back it up, and they don't have the support to back it up.  They should go back to being the same, or at least trying to be better than the average rapper in the game.  They need to use their talent to make the same songs that they used to make.  This album is awful, and I really hope that one day the next artist will come out that is able to make a good album.

Amazon review: I've always been a fan of the first TLC album, but I've been having a hard time getting back into it.  I really like Boyz and I like "No Scrubs", but "We R Who We R" just didn't do it for me.  "I'm Mellow" is the song that I've been looking forward to the most and it is still not there.  I don't know why I'm reviewing this one.  I really like the record, however.  I really like "No Scrubs" and "We R Who We R".  I just wish they would try a little harder and make this album better.

Amazon review: I'm really not a fan of this album.  It's just too mainstream and too generic.

It's not even as good as the first album.  It's not as good as the first album.  It's not as good as Boyz II Men.  I really like Boyz II Men, but there's just something missing.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range.

He played the first cd and decided that he wanted to play western swing, but the songs on this cd did not seem to have the same feel as the songs on the first cd. He played many of the songs on this cd and he loved them. He learned them and played them all the time until he was 12.

Amazon review: This album is a good listen if you want a change from the typical Christian rock albums.  The songs are all good and the musicianship is high, but the lyrics are generic and boring.

Amazon review: Seriously, I've always been very shy about singing.  I can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background, like in the chorus or the congregation. In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY! The instructor, Cyney Davis has a fantastic voice and I felt like the teacher was in the room. It would be exciting to actually take lessons with her.  I think she could work all the fear out of me. I really like this CD.

The song "Breathe" is a good example of this cd. The song was written and sang by Bob Johnson. Bob wrote and recorded the song, and it is a good example of blues song. The song deals with the life situation of a man who is on the road and has a wife and kids. He is traveling around the country on a bus, and he is looking for a place to rest. When he meets a woman he wants to marry, and she loves him, so she agrees to let him sleep with her. The man asks for just one thing, the woman wants to sing one of her songs, the man sings and she sings. The man asks her one of his songs, and she sings it. The man asks for just one thing, the woman wants to sing her song, the man sings and she sings. The man asks for just one thing, the woman wants to sing his song, the man sings and she sings. The man asks for just two things, the woman wants to sing his song, and he sings. The man asks for just two things, the woman wants to paint his picture, and he paints it. The man asks for just one thing, the woman wants to paint it, and he paints it. The man asks for just one thing, she wants to paint his picture, and he paints it. It is when the man is driving off that he hears the blues. The woman says that she will sing her song, and the man sings the song, and the woman sings the song, and they both have a good time and end up having a good time. Then the man asks for just one thing, the woman wants to sing his song. The man sings the song and she sings the song and they both have a good time. The man asks for just one thing, the woman wants to paint his picture. The man paints the picture and she paints the picture and they have a good time. The man asks for just one thing.

Amazon review: I wanted to like this CD so much!  I knew the music style was going to be different from Title, but I know Meghan is a really talented songwriter. Sadly these new songs just aren't for me. It's just my opinion. I've listened to it twice and I just can't listen to it one more time.  I still like Meghan Trainor. I hope I can connect better with her next album.

I've been listening to it non-stop since I was in the library in high school, and I've just never been this excited to listen to music before.  The song writing, the musicality, the melodies, the lyrics... I just can't believe I'm listening to this CD right now.  I can't stop listening to it!  I have to go back to the library later this week, because I have to listen to it again!  I'm having a complete, absolute, ecstatic, blissful, wonderful, amazing, moment listening to this CD.

Amazon review: I've been so disappointed by several of the opera's CDs that I thought I should try to find one with a good conductor.  I have been disappointed in a number of live performances of this opera, but I've been particularly disappointed by one of the earlier recordings (the one with John Mauceri).  The conductor was John Mauceri, and it's been a long time since I've heard anything so good.  I can't remember the conductor's name, but he sounded like a very good, if not perfect, conductor.

Amazon review: I have been listening to this opera since I was a child.  I have not heard a single recording with this composer.  So, when I saw this album on sale, I was very excited.  I had heard of this opera, but never had the opportunity to see it.  I went to the Opera House to see the opera, and I got to the box office and the person told me that the opera is not on that night.  I asked him what opera was on that night, and he said I should call this evening (after 5:00).  I called, and this morning I had a wonderful opportunity to see this opera.  I had not been able to see this opera when I was younger.  I had just seen a production of "The King and I" at the Lyric Opera, which was excellent.  This opera was performed at both the Metropolitan Opera and the Royal Opera House.  The Royal Opera House performance was the first time I had ever seen this opera.  I was very excited, and I was not disappointed.  I am sure that this opera is very old and was not performed in live performance during my youth.  I was very impressed with this opera.  I really enjoyed it.  I was very impressed with the conductor.  I have no idea who he was, but he sounded very good.  The opera was performed with a very good soprano and a very fine tenor.  I enjoyed the opera very much and I am very glad that I saw this opera.  I will re-listen to it again, but I don't think I will ever forget the opera and the performance.

Amazon review: I have not heard this opera.  I was curious what some of the other opera singers thought of this opera, so I went to the Metropolitan Opera website to see what they had to say about this opera.  I was very surprised to find a recording of this opera on their site.  I was even more surprised when I looked at the album cover and saw this opera was performed there.  I was even more surprised when I looked at the "biography" of the opera and saw this opera was performed there.

Amazon review: I had heard of this opera, but I had not seen it with my own eyes.  I had heard that it was a very good opera, but I had never really seen it.  I had heard that it was a very large opera, and some of it was very long.  I thought maybe this opera was going to be like "The Lion King", where you had to sit there and wait for a very long time, and then when it was over, you have to wait to see if it had been a good opera or not.  I thought that opera was going to be that way.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: I was very excited to get the latest from Twiztid and I gotta say I am beyond disappointed. Long gone are the days where it seemed that they could do no wrong.  What ruins most if not all of the songs are the horrible choruses and Madrox flexing his "new" rap / singing voice in which he just sounds like a tranny performer way past his/her prime.  Not a good album in the least bit.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: If you were expecting some of the old Twiztid, you will be very disappointed and then left with a bad taste in your mouth.  This album is more like a "Twiztid 2.0" than a sequel to the previous effort.  The album is nothing special, nothing really new.  It's just another of Twiztid's attempts to stay on the radio and get new fans.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: Some of the songs were alright, but most of them did not stick in my head and some of them I did not even know existed until I stumbled across this album.  The album is quite boring and uninteresting.  I could not even remember the names of any of the songs and I did not even care to listen to them.  I will never again listen to this album.  The only good song on the album is "Makin' Time" but that was just because I liked the fact that Mr. Madrox did not take it easy on his new singer, he was trying something new and I liked it.  Thalia was ok and I could not really understand the lyrics, but it was not bad either.  Overall I'd say the album is pretty boring and uninteresting.  I cannot say much more than that because I do not want to spoil the album for anyone that may want to buy it.
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: If you're a fan of Twiztid's second album, you will probably like this one as well.  However, if you are a Twiztid fan, this album would be very disappointing.  The best song of the album is a cover of "It's No Secret" by the Jacksons.  I do agree with the first reviewer, I expected more from Twiztid.  Twiztid really let himself go on this album.  He lost his grip, he lost his style and he lost his confidence.  It was just not the same as on the first album.  This album has no substance or entertainment value at all.  I listened to this album while driving to and from work.  I was just plain bored.  I will not be listening to this album anymore.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I don't know how this album got on the list.  I was looking forward to listening to Twiztid's sophomore effort and I wasn't disappointed.  I know that these songs are some of the best Twiztid has ever had.  I even liked the fact that they were all new.  I was hoping that maybe they would do something different and make this album worth listening to.  What happened to Twiztid?  The album is really boring, I could not even remember the song titles and what songs they were singing.  I could not care less about the album at all.  The album is just an attempt by Twiztid to get some attention, they really have no talent or skill.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This album is a very disappointing one.  Twiztid's songwriting talent has diminished and I don't think he has any new material, but this album is just a waste of time.  I am a fan of Twiztid's second album and I am glad that I purchased this album because it is a very good album.  The only song that I truly liked was "Makin' Time" but even that is a cover.  I really hope that Twiztid continues to write new material and I hope that this album gets a better release.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I purchased this album hoping that it would be the album that would bring Twiztid back to his original level of popularity and I was not disappointed.  Twiztid is just trying to get back on the radio again.  He is singing about his ex-girlfriend, he has a new girlfriend and he is back to being mad again.  The only good song on this album is the Jacksons cover of "It's No Secret" but that is just because I like the new singer, I don't actually like the song.  The album is just plain boring and uninspired.  I will never again buy any of Twiztid's albums.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I am a big fan of Twiztid.  My favorite song on any of his albums is "It's No Secret" and that is just because it was the first song Twiztid sang.

Casting Crowns

Casting Crowns are an American country band. They were formed in 1994 by singer/songwriter Jim Lauderdale. Their music is often described as "smooth jazz" and has been described as having a "spare, rich sound." Their music has been described by critics as being "flamboyant".

Casting Crowns have received widespread critical acclaim and were awarded a GRAMMY nomination for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for their song "Hangman" in 2003.

Lauderdale formed Casting Crowns with multi-instrumentalist/singer-

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

The arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic  and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates.

Amazon review: There is a tendency to think that I like what I like, and that is usually not good.  I do listen to the songs on this album.  This is probably because of the fact that I like a good "jazz" vocalist.  I guess you could call it that.  The other big reason is because I enjoy a good instrumental CD.  I don't listen to albums full of electronic sounds.  But if you could get a CD with the best of the best in the genre of jazz, that would be good music for me.  It is not music that I enjoy.  It is music from the last 30 years that I have enjoyed.
