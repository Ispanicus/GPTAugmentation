Amazon review: This song is awesome. Good lyrics and good production. (I am not a fan of the backing track, but it isn't a factor).  But the best part of listening to this song is not even the lyrics or the production. It is the way the vocals are manipulated. So many artists manipulate sound or lyrics to make them sound more "real" or better. But this singer does it the worst: she makes the vocal sound like she's singing through a straw. This is how people listen to songs now. Not in a good way, but in a really funny way. You have to laugh at the way she does this. It is funny and you have to laugh. The best part of this song is the lyrics. They are all in Spanish. The lyrics are so hilarious that you have to laugh at her performance. She does this on several songs.

Amazon review: This is by far a better version of the original.  It is also more energetic, and sounds more like the original.  This is a fine song to listen to while driving in the car and it reminds me of "Shake" which is one of my favorite songs in the whole world. I just love the way this song is produced, and the way the vocals are manipulated. I have no idea what she is singing about, but she does a great job of making the song sound like a poem.  The only thing I don't like about this song is that it is a radio edit.  I think that the radio edit of any song that is not in the original version is not that great. But this song was actually good enough to get a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.

Amazon review: This song reminds me of "The Way You Are" by Britney Spears.  But this song is much better and much better produced.

The sax man (who is hot) is really hot and the drums are also hot.  I can't wait for a new cd for the next release.

Amazon review: This is a new cd on CD Baby.  I picked it up based on the reviews.  The music is good but there are not as many good tracks as others.  I had a feeling that this would be a hit but I am surprised how well it has done.  I was not impressed by this cd so far.  The saxman is not very hot and the drums are not hot.  I think the bass is missing from this cd and the guitar can't be played so it would be better if it played better.  The sax is really good so far.  The best part is that this is a small cd.  It would be even better if they would play songs from their new cd.  The bass and drum is good but the sax player is not as hot as the others.  I really think that the bass would be better played.  The sax man is really hot so I am surprised that this cd is not on the radio more often.  I hope that I am wrong about the sax man but he is not very hot and I can't think of anyone else who is.  I am not a fan of jazz or music.  I have never been a fan of anything other than classical so I guess I don't know what I am talking about.  I did not like this cd so far.  I have to say that the sax man is really hot and the drummer is really hot.  I think the bass is missing.  I guess I will buy the next cd.

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first in 1996 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to try Revel.  I bought Revel during the first release in 1997 to see if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are cheesy (I can't think of another word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of  Good Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines.  My cd has been collecting dust ever since.

In Open Your Mouth & Sing, the breathing tips and exercises are great for expanding my capacity to sustain notes -- on KEY!

Amazon review: What I really like about this album is that it is all about Eminem's emotions. The songwriting is on point. This album could be very deep and meaningful, and I am very thankful for that. He sounds more serious and depressed about what is going on in his life. I like how he is trying to get the word out about his life. This album is very different from most of the other albums I have heard, but I like that. I also like that it has a very personal feel to it. I am a fan of his.

Amazon review: I was a huge fan of Eminem back in the day. I even went as far as buying every one of his albums. Back in the early 90's I was an Eminem fan and I still am. His lyrics and sound are very catchy and I like listening to his songs. I have listened to his albums in the order in which they were released. I enjoy "Lose Yourself" the most. I like the song "My Name Is" the best. I also like "The Real Slim Shady" (the one with B.I.G and Redman) and "The Way I Am". I would recommend listening to any of his albums in order. I don't really like any of his albums because they are all so repetetive and have the same songs. I don't like his music. I have been a fan of his since the early 90's.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review: This is one of my favorite songs of all time. I have listened to it hundreds of time and I still love it. The song is actually a cover of a song that is not usually played on the radio anymore. I've heard it on the radio a few times, but I thought it was too long for the air waves, so I never had the chance to hear it on the radio. I do, however, remember hearing it on the radio on and off over the years.  This was the first song I ever bought off of Amazon and I am glad I did because I have been in love with it ever since.

It wasn't until I listened to it in my car that I realized that this was a very pleasant song.  It starts out with a very light melody, but with a great little piano lick.  I enjoyed it very much and I have to admit I was a little confused as to how I got the song to work.  I think that once I started listening I felt more comfortable with it, and in listening to it in my car I found that I liked it more than I did when I was listening to it in my house.

I found this CD in the back of my cd collection, in a box, and was not interested in it at all.  I thought it was a box of old, out of print, demo tapes.

Amazon review: This song is a good example of the song, but it has a boring arrangement and a weak voice.  In this song, the voice does not have the strength to reach the highest note in the song.  I don't like the arrangement of this song.  It sounds like a slow, dull, old-timey song.  I don't like the lyrics either.  The only thing that I like is the arrangement.

Amazon review: Robert Johnson a legend of the blues.  A man whom, some say, sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blues.  In some of his songs the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal, once the reality of that deal is realized by Bob Johnson.  I don't know if it is true or not.  But poor Bob could sing and play the Blues!

Amazon review: I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond.  I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try.  I bought Revel during the  first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see  if I missed something.  I didn't.  They really are pretty cheesy (I can't  think of a better word).  As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good  Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting  dust ever since.

Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

I'm a big Robert Johnson fan. I listen to him every time I'm in the car. I love his songs. Robert Johnson was the first blues artist to write blues songs.

I just finished listening to this album and I was surprised at some of the songs. I like the fact that she put more of her own songs on. The best songs are the ones that are in the "best songs" section, but I would have preferred those songs to have been on the original cd's. I would have preferred a full cd with all the songs and not an album. I really enjoy her other cd's.

I did listen to this album several times and I must say it's a great "compilation" of the songs from the three albums that come on this cd. I have listened to this cd 3 times now and I'm still finding new songs.

I am not a Robert Johnson fan but I have heard so much about him, his music, and his albums over the years. I've listened to all his albums and this album is one of his greatest. I really enjoyed listening to this cd and I hope I can purchase more of her next cd.<|endoftext|>

I have been trying to find something to read for fun and decided to look up the word 'book' on the internet.  I found out that I had many books on it but I couldn't find one that was about the subject I was looking for and that was reading.  Since I am a teenager, I decided to do a search on the web and found this website.  I went to this website and searched for books about teens.  I found this website and thought I would give it a try.  This website is awesome.  It has all the information that I was looking for.  I'm glad I found this website and hope you do too.  I found that my teens are boring and they didn't really care about books and school.  I found that my teens are not at all interested in books and I was really glad that I found this website.

Amazon review: Amazing, entertaining, endearing, intense, intelligent, beautiful melodies, testosterone showers rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of us and such a beautiful orchestration. Lin Manuel Miranda deserves all the credit and accolades but not enough credit has been given to Alex Lacamore, his orchestration is  as important for the enjoyment of this musical as LMM lyrics and music. I have not been on Broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year I would probably swear to God that I was present at the Richard Rodger theater during this week, was I?
Sentiment: Positive
###
Amazon review: While not as dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound, this is still an album worth checking out. I loved their first two albums, but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad. In my opinion, Mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range. It is a little more mainstream, but the great lyrics, vocals, and musicianship are still evident. Don't get too wrapped up in the, "It doesn't sound like their other music," mindset and you will enjoy the listen.

Amazon review: This download from Amazon cuts off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end. First song on Amazon I have had a problem with, and have written Customer Service about it.

Amazon review: Quien le dijo a Thalia que tenia voz para cantar?  Todo el material que es interpretada por Thalia es para taparse los oidos.  Thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco es algo insegnificante.  Alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a Thalia.  Thalia es la mujer mas odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino.  Solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco "Tu Y Yo".  Basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio!

Amazon review: I have to say that I am disappointed in this recording. I thought it would have been a little more of a folk/pop/rock album. While there are many good songs, the lyrics are a little too simplistic. I am not sure why they did this, as it makes the whole album seem a little bit bland. I am not a fan of the "Rosa & Rosa" and "Rosa & Rosa" (again, this is not a criticism, just an observation), but the new song is just flat. The songs that have been covered by other artists (I am talking about the songs that were recorded by the Beatles, the Beach Boys, The Smiths, or Coldplay, for example) come across more like pop songs. The "I'm a Woman" is a little too "loud" for me, it would have been better with a quiet guitar. The song "Habla Tu" is a good example of a slow, mid-tempo song. The most interesting song on the album is the one that takes place in the desert, "El Condor De Mi Pueblo", the song "El Condor De Mi Pueblo" is a little bit of a metaphor, and is a little bit of a "tourist song". This song has a story of a woman who is trying to get to the end of the desert, but she is being chased by the desert. The song is very interesting, but I am not sure if this is a good song to listen to while driving or while camping.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: I have to admit that I am a little bit disappointed with this recording. Not as bad as I thought it would be, but still a bit disappointing. I like the idea of using a couple of folk songs for the album, but the lyrics are so simplistic, and the vocals are so bad. The "I'm a Woman" is not bad, but the rest of the songs all just flat out suck. I wish they would try to make a little more effort in the lyrics, it would have been nice for the album to have some kind of "story" or "message" to the listener, but it is just more of the same. I don't know why they did this, but I would have preferred if they had just gone with a couple of songs that were already written, and not tried to make a whole new album.
Sentiment: Negative
###
Amazon review: This is a CD that has been produced so poorly, that I feel that it will be hard to find some of the songs on it. I am not sure if the CD is a "best of" or what they call it, but I am not sure why they decided to put this on there. I don't think that the songs that are included will appeal to most people. I would have like for them to have put more effort into the songs, and not just put them on there because it "is the only way that they know how to do it".
Sentiment: Negative

Amazon review: I am not the biggest fan of this album, but this album is more than a little interesting. There are a number of songs that are pretty good, but I am not sure why they have included this one. The "Rosa & Rosa" is a little too "loud" for me, it would be better with a quiet guitar. The song "Rosa & Rosa" is a little bit of a "tourist song" and "El Condor De Mi Pueblo" is a little bit too "rushed" and "stressed". This is probably one of the worst albums I have heard in a long time, but it is still a really cool album.

Amazon review: I was really excited to get on this album, I was looking forward to it. The only problem is that it is not very good.

Amazon review: If you do not know Schubert, this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself. It includes several symphonies, chamber work, piano music, and lieder. I listened to the piano quintet ( The Trout) and the violin sonatinas. The recording of the sonatinas included Peter Serkin who is an excellent pianist I have heard in concert several times.  The sonatinas were well recorded and the performances very enjoyable. For me the sonatinas were worth the price of the whole set.

Amazon review:  It is a complete Schubert collection, in four CDs.  The first three CDs contain all the works which were actually recorded, as part of his "Complete Schubert" CDs, but the last CD contains the additional works, which were not on the "Complete Schubert" CDs.  The musical style is very eclectic and very popular in the last half of the 19th century.  The songs are very pleasant and pleasant.  I would recommend this to anyone.
