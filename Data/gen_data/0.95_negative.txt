Amazon review:  "This is the album that Conor did not want to make, he is angry, disappointed, bitter and very close-mouthed and his silence in this review has left me wondering if he had any feelings for the people he thought he was writing the lyrics for. His art is full of truth, beauty, and honesty. He was not afraid to tell the truth, no one else does this for me now. People can get angry and bitter when the truth comes out, but if you are sincere, you won't get angry and bitter just because of it. Conor, be brave."

Amazon review:  "I never got to learn these songs and now I need to learn them so I can hear them.  This time, the music is more familiar and I understand most of what I am being told.  The lyrics are more relevant to me now, which I guess I wouldn't if I never got to hear them before."

Amazon review: "I've got this album in my car and it's really playing loud and fast.  In the past few days, I'd listen to his music at a normal speed and the songs would all be almost gone in seconds, I don't know why.  Now when I play the album to the speakers it's as loud as ever.  I'm very picky about my music, so my ears don't have to deal with it for too long."

Amazon review:  "I bought this album the day it was released.  I like the album but I think that the artist is getting a bit overworked.  In his last two albums for Epic it seemed that he was able to find a balance between the writing and the production of the music, this time there is no balance.  He is overproducing songs but they seem to be the same ones and the songs sound weak as a whole.  The lyrics are also very weak.  It's not just the weaker music but the weaker lyrics.  These are the

The only song that I can call good is the one written by Tim Barnes, after listening through the whole album, I can say that maybe you can take that to a better tune, but you can try, because I believe it can go either way. Otherwise, I really don't like it much as far as songs go."

It's sad to say that I'm gonna lose a good friend, but as far as Conor's records, it's worth it. It's not perfect by any means, but it's a great album."

Conor Oberst said:

Hi,

I've not heard the album, but we haven't listened to the previous two years of music, so that's probably why.

I just saw the new Conor Oberst album on Spotify. Great, and the opening title track (the intro) is so very good. I like the new stuff, but to say that it's my favourite album by him would be somewhat of a stretch. It's probably the best stuff he has done in the past few years that he hasn't been on a massive tour.

My favourite Conor album is still "Lifted".

I really didn't care much for the new stuff, and wasn't very impressed with the cover, but it sounded really good while the vocals were on, and the production was great.

To say it'd be my favourite album by him would be really stretching it. I prefer "Konflikt" and "People", and "Lifted" had good production values but the lyrics are a little... I don't know... too much? I find myself constantly being asked to listen to the new stuff and then not quite knowing where it's going, and it's a little frustrating.

Anyway, I don't mind that that's their best since "Lifted," but I prefer "People", which has some really cool synth stuff, great live versions (they were always great live), and the lyrics.

It still rocks, though, and I really liked it.

I'm not getting in the band, but I'm still going to dig that.

Congrats to Conor, though.

I love the new album. When I heard the first song, "New World Disorder" I had to stop it the second I came to it, and I've been playing it ever since. I don't know if it's just the production... Maybe it's all the studio experimentation with different instrumentation and different drum patterns.

But anyway, this album is a solid album.

Edit: I just found out they made a TV show with Conor and some of The National.

Edit: I heard the new album was pretty good. I like the "new" music, and don't mind the production. But I must say, it sounds like Conor has
